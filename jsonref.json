Bright-yellow stripes are being applied to the pavement at now-familiar two-metre intervals outside the school’s three sets of gates, and over the next few days, these markers will appear in classrooms, too. In between, dedicated routes will be laid out to take children safely from the school gates to their classroom doors.These plans, orchestrated by Bonneville’s headteacher, Andrea Parker, were being rolled out as the school prepared to reopen its doors to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils in line with the latest government guidelines. Schools, colleges and nurseries across England welcomed more children and students from 1 June onwards – and headteachers like Parker are busy preparing to embrace a new way of learning.“For every headteacher, keeping children safe is going to be at the top of their priorities”, says Parker, who is also the lead headteacher for Jessop primary and Stockwell primary schools. “We began our preparations by sending out a survey to check the pulse of how teachers and parents were feeling about returning to school. From there, we were able to start modelling what we need to do to support our families, and help them to feel more confident in sending their children back.”Since lockdown, the school has continued to take in around 25 of its 420 pupils each day, split into smaller groups for safety – the children of key workers, those from vulnerable families, or with education, health and care plans in place. “We’ve been open every day during lockdown,” says Parker. “Staff members even volunteered to work through the holidays, which has been fantastic.”Meanwhile, those teachers who have remained at home have been working on providing the online resources parents need for home schooling. “Overnight, we’ve all had to completely change how we work on a day-to-day basis with no training and no transition period, and teachers have been working incredibly hard to achieve that,” she says.At the same time, Parker believes temporary home schooling can’t replace the benefits of schools-based education, especially when it comes to the transitions experienced by those children who will begin returning to school from 1 June.“Reception, year 1 and year 6 are all key milestones,” she says. “Younger children are in the early stages of their education, and we want to be there for them as they develop their reading and friendship groups, and simply learn how to learn.“At the other end of the spectrum, year 6 are about to go to secondary school. It’s a time when they celebrate their SATs and everything they’ve achieved and worked hard for.”The Bonneville school building, which dates back to 1905, is large and welcoming. When I visit, days before reopening, crafted cardboard models of sea animals hang from the ceilings, and children’s work covers every inch of spare space on the walls.With only a fraction of the school’s 420 pupils in attendance – including Parker’s own six-year-old daughter, who is in school as the child of a key worker – the sound of children’s laughter, which usually fills these hallways, can only faintly be heard drifting in from the playground.“Our teachers are very excited and as desperate to see the children as I am,” she says. “They’re anxious, too, but going through our risk assessments with them has helped a lot.“With fewer children coming back to start with, we don’t need everybody to be here, which means those who are very anxious can be asked to come back later on. Hopefully they’ll see how things are working and their confidence will build – some people just need that, much like the parents who need to have a choice.”Home schooling for those children who remain at home will continue to be supported by teachers, but to reassure those who do send their children in, a raft of safety measures has been put in place.At the school gates, parents are required to socially distance from each other (guided by those painted stripes) during staggered drop-offs. “Bubbles” of up to 15 children will be dropped off together, with an allocated “bubble lead” – the class teacher – taking students into the building in shifts.Before entering their classroom, they sanitise their hands before being allocated a desk each for taking lessons, watching pre-recorded assemblies, and eating lunch, which will be delivered at the door. Outside space will be utilised for lessons as much as possible, while playtime and PE will be enjoyed within the children’s inidual groups.“Although younger children will be in smaller groups, it’s not just about the size of each bubble – it’s about dynamics as well,” says Parker. “Children are people with their own personalities and their own way of being, so we have to make sure each one is a manageable group and dynamic.”Extra hygiene measures include specific play and sports equipment allocated to each bubble, regular handwashing, staggered bathroom breaks followed by janitor cleaning, and early closing on Friday afternoons for deep-cleaning sessions. The early Friday closure will also be used to facilitate statutory planning and preparation time for teachers. The school has also drawn up sets of principles that parents, teachers and children will be asked to adhere to.For staff, these include having an awareness of each other – for example, no more than two teachers in the staffroom at a time. For children, the principles include reinforcing the NHS’s Catch it, Bin it, Kill it messaging. For parents, coming to collect children as quickly as possible if they fall ill.Bonneville has also worked to tailor specific solutions to the erse community the school serves. “In terms of the country Lambeth is hugely erse”, says Parker, citing the borough’s significant Caribbean, African and Asian communities, as well as pupils from Spanish-, French- and Portuguese-speaking backgrounds.“We know that the BAME community have surfaced as being prone to having a higher rate of infection”, says Parker, explaining that the school’s risk assessment process is being developed with the heightened vulnerability of BAME students, staff and their wider community in mind.Communicating to children why their schools have changed is a crucial part of helping them adapt to their new regimes, so Parker plans to share a virtual tour of the new school layout with pupils, and plug lessons about the roles of key workers into the curriculum.Parker’s plans have focused on building confidence among children, staff and parents, and communicating with them every step of the way. “It’s about trying to adapt, even though we don’t know how long we’re going to be adapting for,” she says.Check with your Local Authority for the latest news on schools opening in your area.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Even in the surrounding country it was a foggy day, but there the fog was grey, whereas in London it was, at about the boundary line, dark yellow, and a little within it brown, and then browner, and then browner, until at the heart of the City – which call Saint Mary Axe – it was rusty-black. From any point of the high ridge of land northward, it might have been discerned that the loftiest buildings made an occasional struggle to get their heads above the foggy sea, and especially that the great dome of Saint Paul’s seemed to die hard but this was not perceivable in the streets at their feet, where the whole metropolis was a heap of vapour charged with muffled sound of wheels, and enfolding a gigantic catarrh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f3ccb5b8ab0b51021310884f195fcd9587fe787/66_0_3368_2022/master/3368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ed92f766aea22208791e946572a2d70","title":"uk retailers face declining sales amid covid 19 shutdown","story":"Lockdown easing and price cuts fail to stop second successive slump in monthly salesBritain’s retailers suffered a second successive slump in monthly sales during May as the coronavirus shutdown took its toll on the high street.The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said there were some glimmers of hope last month, which figures from Barclaycard supported, but the outlook remained grim for many retailers even as the lockdown began to ease.From 15 June, most shops will be allowed to re-open, though a demand by ministers that they require customers to maintain physical distancing has thrown the sector into confusion and sparked demands in some quarters for a relaxation of the distancing rule from 2 metres to 1 metre.Last month the BRC warned that shops face a “fight for survival” in the coming months as they try to restore their fortunes with tough new physical distancing and health and safety requirements.Across the industry, the falling demand for petrol and the temporary closure of many retail outlets meant most retailers remained stuck in reverse gear last month.Office supplies, fitness equipment and bicycles all performed well, thanks to strong online sales, and DIY was boosted by the reopening of garden centres, the BRC said.Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive said: “Sales in May demonstrated yet another month of struggle for retailers across the country, despite an improvement on the previous month.“Nonetheless, as the sun came out and restaurants lay dormant, food sales rose with consumers taking to their local parks for beers, BBQs and picnics.

The coronavirus pandemic forced airlines around the world to ground their fleets.The International Air Transport Association has updated its forecasts and predicted a further $15.8bn loss next year, taking total losses caused by the pandemic to $100bn. Iata believes that air traffic will be slow to recover and airlines will have to slash their fares to lure back passsengers.It argues that making wearing face masks mandatory on board and other safety measures will be enough to ensure a safe return to flying. The UK government’s 14-day quarantine for international air arrivals took effect yesterday, but Iata director general Alexandre de Juniac said:These measures should give governments the confidence to open borders without quarantine measures.Gareth Baker, energy partner at the law firm Gowling WLG, says:With the continuing reduction in commercial and industrial demand caused by COVID-19, combining with high wind speeds and sunny days, coal was always going to be the loser in our energy mix. Whilst this is part of a long-term trend, the system has coped with the substantial increase in renewable generation remarkably well. The next challenge is how the network balances and manages intermittency and energy storage has to become a substantial part of the solution.In a more positive milestone, Britain will tomorrow reach two consecutive months without using electricity from coal-fired power stations for the first time since the industrial revolution in the 19th century, according to the National Grid, Reuters reports.Britain opened its first coal plant in the 1880s and coal became the main source of electricity over the next century. But coal plants emit almost double the amount of carbon dioxide (which is blamed for global warming) as gas-fired power plants, and use of (near) zero carbon sources such as wind and solar is steadily growing.The UK intends to shut its coal plants by 2024 as part of efforts to hit its net zero emissions goal by 2050.However, business surveys from the Banque de France showed a rebound in sentiment in industry, services and construction in May, roughly offsetting a third of the loss recorded since February, noted Oxford Economics analyst Moritz Degler.Turning to the eurozone GDP figures, he said:The Fed will issue economic forecasts for the first time since December at the end of its meeting tomorrow, but is not expected make any major policy announcements.The central bank’s policy makers will discuss the unexpectedly strong employment data released last Friday, which showed a surprise gain of more than 2.5m jobs last month while the unemployment rate fell.The Covid-19 pandemic prompted the Fed to cut interest rates to near zero and to launch a number of credit programmes to prop up the economy at emergency meetings in March, but no major moves are expected tomorrow.

Dearlove said he believed the pandemic had “started as an accident” after the virus escaped the lab. A month earlier, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, had said he had “enormous evidence” that Covid-19 had originated in a lab in China, only to backtrack from this claim on live TV in the same sentence.Suggestions that Covid-19 is a manmade virus are the latest chapter in a tale of blame, misinformation and finger-pointing. Cue the conspiracy theorists, marching out their narrative about the high-security BSL-4 lab in Wuhan, where mysterious experiments to design “frankenviruses” led to the tragic global pandemic. Cue the genetic analyses pointing to “unexpected” insertions in the code of A, G, T, and C that explain how this virus could not have evolved naturally. Cue political posturing against China, with calls for an inquiry, trade sanctions and even reparations.Determining the origins and emergence of a pandemic is as messy and complex as studying a plane crash. Just as an air crash investigator pieces together fragments at a crash site, pinpointing the origins of a new virus is painstakingly difficult and time-consuming, and requires logic and reason. I know, because this is exactly what our organisation, EcoHealth Alliance, does. We work around the world to identify the origins of pandemics, map them and analyse them, and use these results to predict where the next pandemic will likely emerge. We then target these “hotspots” for enhanced surveillance, capacity-building and risk-reduction programmes to prevent diseases emerging.We have spent the past 15 years working in China to analyse the group of viruses from which Sars and now Covid-19 have emerged. Sampling more than 16,000 bats, we showed that Sars emerged from a cluster of coronaviruses carried by horseshoe bats that are abundant across southern and central China and traded frequently in wet markets. We found Sars-related viruses that could infect human cells in the lab, cause diseases in lab animals, and evade drugs and vaccines designed to protect us. We worked with the scientists behind the breakthrough drug Remdesivir to show that it was effective against known human coronaviruses and the viruses we suspected might be the next to emerge. We raised the red flag on these viruses and pointed out their potential to cause the next pandemic.\u0026nbspOur 15 years of work in China now puts us in a unique position to identify, with a remarkable degree of confidence, the likely origin of Covid-19. We recently published a peer-reviewed paper reporting 781 genetic sequences of bat-origin coronaviruses previously unknown to scientists. These include the closest known relatives to Sars-CoV, Sars-CoV-2 and Sads-CoV, a virus that killed more than 25,000 pigs in Guangdong in 2016 and 2017. All are carried by horseshoe bats that are found across southern China and neighbouring countries. Our report firmly concludes that Covid-19 originated in bats, in a hotspot of viral evolution along the border of Yunnan province in China, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam.\u0026nbspMost people (including former heads of intelligence agencies) aren’t trained in how to decipher genetic codes, so we have to assess the rigour of competing research to determine the truth of claims that Covid-19 was manmade. Writing in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Medicine, researchers strongly refuted the idea that the code had been purposefully manipulated. Whereas the article in Nature Medicine was written by senior virologists, one author, John Fredrik Moxnes, the chief scientific adviser to the Norwegian military, has already withdrawn his name from the paper cited by Dearlove – while scientists from the Francis Crick institute and Imperial College London also dismissed its conclusions.And the claim in the earlier version of this paper to have proven “beyond reasonable doubt that the Covid-19 virus is engineered” was removed in the later version. This claim relied on an insertion in the genetic code for the spike protein of the virus, the place where the virus locks into our own cells. But the discovery of another novel bat coronavirus in southern China, very closely related to Sars-CoV-2, that includes a similar insertion shows this can evolve naturally.\u0026nbspUnfortunately, this sort of logic will not deter conspiracy theorists. The dark power of the internet means that anyone, anywhere, can find evidence to echo even the most outlandish of claims. Theories that Sars originated from space or that HIV was manmade are readily available, but it doesn’t make them true. Such conspiracies play to our most base instincts and paranoias – fears that dissolve logic and reason. The details of how this virus emerged naturally are far less exciting. They’re about how humans and animals have interacted for millennia, now at an unprecedented rate. They’re about how human domination of the world’s ecosystems as we encroach on animal habitats is opening new pathways for viruses, once hidden in the depths of the forest, to be transmitted to humans.Even as Covid-19 continues to spread across the world, analysing its origin is of critical importance for our species on this planet. If we allow myths and rumours to set our pandemic prevention agenda, we miss, quite literally, the forest for the trees. We estimate that there are 1.7m undiscovered viruses in wildlife in emerging disease hotspots such as rural southeast Asia. Rather than chasing conspiracies, we should be focusing our efforts on these regions and the communities on their frontlines. A pandemic such as this one isn’t a once-in-a-lifetime tragedy. Ignoring the guidance of the global scientific community about how and why they emerge will come at a great cost to us all.• Peter Daszak is president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit dedicated to analysing and preventing pandemics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2697f8c110816694e4b8d385d35d7e723bbda2a/0_275_5396_3237/master/5396.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b64d79f0675c516e55be912642e00b48","title":"plans to reopen english primary schools before summer in disarray","story":"Government sources acknowledge practicalities too difficult for all children to returnPlans to push ahead with reopening schools in England are in disarray, after the government admitted that not all primary school pupils will be able to return to the classroom before the end of summer.Boris Johnson last month said his aim was “to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages,” as he announced the opening of primary schools to pupils in reception, year one and year six from 1 June.But government sources now acknowledge that – with little more than six weeks remaining before schools close for summer – the practicalities are too difficult for all children to return.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is to give an update on the progress of schools reopening on Tuesday, and is expected to concede publicly that many primary pupils will not return to their classrooms until the new school year in autumn.The acknowledgement was welcomed by school leaders, with Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, saying: “If confirmed, we’re pleased to see the government will not force the impossible. Schools will continue to use their flexibility, intelligently, to deliver the very best for all the pupils in their school.”Attendance statistics collected by the Department for Education to be published on Tuesday are likely to confirm that only half of pupils in the three eligible year groups returned to school last week.The attendance figures represent a setback for Johnson’s efforts to use schools as a lever to revive the economy. Johnson’s “roadmap” for exiting the lockdown, published last month, stated: “The government’s ambition is for all primary school children to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible, though this will be kept under review.”But Johnson’s announcement of a 1 June return was greeted with scepticism by parents and opposition from school unions and local authorities, wary of the health and safety difficulties for both staff and pupils in England’s ageing and cramped classrooms.Whiteman, who represents leaders in the majority of England’s primary schools, said: “Throughout lockdown, school leaders and their teams have worked hard to meet the needs of all their pupils. This term, they must be given flexibility they need to balance the needs of the pupils coming back and the children continuing to learn at home.“Returning all pupils before the end of this term will present unsolvable practical barriers if the hierarchies of control are to be maintained. Year groups have had to be split into groups of 15, using up other classrooms and occupying teachers from other years.”In a further confirmation of the difficulties that teachers face, Matt Hancock hinted at Monday’s Downing Street press briefing that even a full return in September may be difficult.Hancock said that for secondary schools, September was the “current working plan” but it would require “ingenuity”. Johnson has said he would like to see the 2-metre distancing rule altered, although Department for Education guidance already states that young children need not socially distance within the small groups, or “bubbles”, in which they are taught.Scotland and Northern Ireland have already said that their schools will not reopen more widely until after the summer holidays, with Scotland saying that schools will use a flexible mix of in-person and remote learning for the foreseeable future. Schools in Wales are to partially reopen later this month for a brief period.Schools in all parts of the UK have remained open for the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils, with many operating throughout the Easter and half-term holidays."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a71c9eaadbe11069f0f895777a32fe6a13dc53c1/0_77_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff833a7843929d02eca46192b7b1efc4","title":"yellowstone grizzly bear 399 conservation","story":"‘399’, at 24 one of the oldest grizzlies living outside a zoo, becomes symbol of bears’ recovery in Yellowstone ecosystemA few weeks ago, a nature photographer who lives near Yellowstone national park sent a four-word text message to Dr Jane Goodall, the British primatologist.“Miraculously, she still lives!”The photographer, Thomas Mangelsen, was referring to a grizzly bear known as “399”, probably the most famous wild bruin in the world. Aged 24, not only is she one of the oldest grizzlies living outside a zoo, she has also continued having cubs to a venerable age, becoming a poster child for the recovery of bears in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem.And no grizzly has done more, through her own behavior, to change a perception that members of her species are temperamental menaces ready to attack people at the slightest provocation.In mid-May, the 350lb grand dame emerged in Yellowstone, striding alongside Pilgrim Creek. Trailing close behind the matriarch were four cubs, born this winter in a wilderness den high in the snowy backcountry.\u0026nbspMangelsen has been chronicling the life and times of 399 for nearly 15 years.\u0026nbspGoodall counts herself among the bear’s most ardent admirers, and, holed up in England, was eagerly awaiting word on whether 399 had survived the long winter.\u0026nbspMangelsen said she was ecstatic.The population of grizzlies in the Yellowstone region was given protection under the Endangered Species Act in 1975 after their numbers dipped to less than 150, and scientists feared they could disappear altogether. But their recovery, thanks to habitat protection, crackdowns on poaching and a ban on hunting, is considered one of the greatest conservation triumphs in US history.\u0026nbspToday, at least\u0026nbsp700 grizzlies inhabit the region and, luring tourists, they have paid tangible economic idends.Born in 1996, 399 has demonstrated the importance of a healthy female bear to an overall population. At least 22 bears are descended from her, both cubs and cubs of cubs (in human terms, grandchildren).\u0026nbspIt’s possible she could become a great grandmother – a senior citizen who is still having offspring of her own.Generally pacific in nature, 399 has raised her broods by roadsides in view of groups of curious humans, including some who have exercised poor judgment by moving closer to take photographs of her and her cubs. She has, with one exception, demonstrated incredible restraint.In 2007, she mauled a Wyoming schoolteacher after he strolled by a spot where 399 and three cubs were feeding on an elk carcass in the bushes.\u0026nbspThe teacher survived, and the park superintendent determined that the mother was only behaving naturally, acting in defense of the cubs and their meal.Yet researchers note that it’s not easy being a young grizzly, even with a keen parent like 399.\u0026nbspAbout\u0026nbsphalf\u0026nbspof those in 399’s bloodline have died. One was shot by a big-game hunter, another was killed for preying upon cattle, and a few have been struck by cars.\u0026nbspThe drama has played out in front of legions of human onlookers who, in turn, have circulated details on social media as if 399 were the star of a soap opera.The oldest grizzly in the Yellowstone region documented with cubs was 27. Mangelsen had a hunch that 399 would emerge this year with more of her own. During the summer of 2019 she was seen in the company of a regular suitor, a huge 600lb male nicknamed Bruno who is believed to have sired some of 399’s earlier infants. Mangelsen and other observers were not disappointed.“Four-cub litters are rare,” said Frank van Manen, a senior research biologist who oversees the Yellowstone region’s\u0026nbspGrizzly Bear Study Team. “We have documented females producing cubs well into their early- to mid- 20s, but a litter of four at that age is definitely unique.”Most visitors come to Yellowstone hoping to catch a glimpse of bears. \u0026nbspThere is a heated public debate about whether sport hunting of bears should again be allowed in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, where the Greater Yellowstone population lives. That question, along with the possible removal of endangered species protections, is tied up in the courts.To manage the throngs of bear watchers, Grand Teton national park, next door to Yellowstone, has\u0026nbspmobilized its “bear brigade”. Apart from trying to keep safe distances between bears and tourists, it has an added coronavirus-era task of doing the same between people. Last week, it was not uncommon to see people trading information about the whereabouts of 399 through open car windows.For Steve Franklin, a retired firefighter and arson investigator from Phoenix, 399 possesses a particular mystique. Franklin told the  that he had just made his own contribution to the lore of this celebrity bear, having spotted her before anyone else.“I dreamed of being the person who sees her first in the spring and gets the photo,” Franklin said. “Everyone who knows the legacy of 399 wants to be that person.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d44cdaa49b6f2bfd62bbd3ebca1a2efdd4e7c20e/0_169_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f534efa5205e1b9e2887ef361c7029a","title":"yvonne orji the outfit made me feel like a superhero like how beyonce has sasha fierce","story":"The Insecure actress and comic on the importance of having elements of African style in her clothes, and the meaning of Molly’s power suitsI wore this LaQuan Smith Lycra bodysuit, all-black everything, when I opened for Chris Rock as part of his Total Blackout tour at the Barclays Arena in Brooklyn in December 2017.

Pesto simply implies that the ingredients have been pounded together, so you can have mint or coriander pesto, and can dispense with the parmesan should you wish. I often incorporate a few leaves of mint with the basil, or even some leaves of wild garlic.Broad beans will work beautifully here in place of the peas, though I would be tempted to pop them from their skins after cooking.

Email feast@theI love jollof rice, but never get it quite right at home. What’s the secret?Beth, Cobham, SurreyThis seemingly simple question is a loaded one – the beloved West African staple has caused diplomatic incidents (Nigeria’s culture minister was accused of betraying his country’s cuisine in 2017 after reportedly saying Senegal’s was the best jollof) and famously got Jamie Oliver into hot water when he added coriander, parsley and lemon to the traditional orange-red mix (#JollofGate). So, into the trenches we go…The principle of jollof, says Zoe Adjonyoh, founder of Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, is “it’s a red sauce with onion and heat”. It’s what you do after this – the vegetables (carrots and peas are popular), rice, liquid, meat and the cooking method – that’s the subject of dispute in Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cameroon and beyond. “Every household has a different way of cooking it,” Adjonyoh explains.What can be agreed on, however, is that time is essential. “Like most West African food, you can’t rush it,” says chef Maria Bradford, who grew up in Sierra Leone. “You want to caramelise the onions slowly in coconut oil, before adding tomatoes, spices, herbs, ginger, garlic, scotch bonnet, white cabbage and, finally, stock.”Adjonyoh agrees: “The secret is in how much love and attention you give the sauce.” That’s what flavours the dish, after all. She blends tomatoes, onion, scotch bonnet, tomato puree, dried chilli and salt, and makes a spice mix of ground ginger and coriander, onion powder, garlic powder, smoked crayfish powder, smoked prawn powder, dawadawa (fermented locust bean), nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, salt and, sometimes, brown sugar. It’s a long list, yes, but, as Adjonyoh explains, “in Ghana, jollof is more aromatic”. Add a tablespoon of the spice mix to caramelised onions, along with chilli powder, madras hot curry powder, fresh ginger and garlic, then the tomatoes and good chicken stock, and cook until it “doesn’t taste of tomato any more, but just the spices”.Adjonyoh washes her rice three times, then works to a 1:2 rice-to-liquid ratio: “You want the tomato base to make up two-thirds of that ‘liquid’, and you add it only once the rice is boiling in the remaining third of water, to open up the grain.” Pop on a lid, then, once two-thirds of the liquid has been absorbed, turn off the heat and leave to finish cooking in its steam.The rice used is also a bone of contention. Adjonyoh favours long-grain, while chef Fafa Gilbert goes for jasmine (for its “scent and sweet flavour”) or basmati Lope Ariyo, author of Hibiscus, flits between the latter and long-grain, which she parboils before finishing off in 1:1½ rice-to-liquid. Emeka Frederick, half of the duo behind Nigerian tapas joint Chuku’s, uses brown rice at home and quinoa in the restaurant: “It has the right flavour profile, but in a lighter form.” Not to mention none of the preconceptions.\u0026nbspTraditionally, jollof is made over fire, so to emulate that smokiness, Gilbert recommends slightly charring the bottom, before upping the ante with smoked paprika, as well as thyme, rosemary and nutmeg. And, because extra fat is always a good idea, she finishes her jollof with butter or coconut oil, and serves it with grilled chicken, fried plantain and avocado.Ultimately, that’s the joy of jollof: you do you, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. “What I love is that everybody cooks it in their own way,” Frederick says. “Forget jollof wars and follow your tastebuds – but do add a kick of fresh ginger.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

It could be a cautious market this summer and if Bayern, United and Real delay over Havertz, the path could be clear for Lampard to move in.Arranging a deal for Havertz is unlikely to be easy, with reports in Germany suggesting Leverkusen could hold out for as much as €100m (£89m) for a player who has scored five goals in four games since the Bundesliga resumed last month. Chelsea, who are also interested in the Leicester left-back Ben Chilwell, have held early talks with Leverkusen and would hope to negotiate a fee in the region of £70m.

He was heavily involved in the pursuit of Werner, whose £53m release clause expires next week, and has seen Chelsea struggle in the creative department since selling Eden Hazard to Real Madrid for £105m last summer. With Pedro set to join Roma on a free and Willian yet to extend a deal that runs out on 30 June, Lampard will have room in the wide areas. Havertz, who made his Leverkusen debut at the age of 17, would offer an injection of youthful quality.Chelsea, whose shortlist also includes the Brentford winger Saïd Benrahma, will need to sell players to enable a heavy spend on Werner, Ziyech, Chiwell and Havertz. Although it is understood Leicester are open to selling Chilwell, they will not let the England left-back leave on the cheap. Chelsea will need to trim their squad, with uncertainty over the futures of Emerson Palmieri, Michy Batshuayi, Jorginho, Ross Barkley and Marcos Alonso.N’Golo Kanté has given Chelsea a boost after returning to contact training, raising hopes that he will be available for selection after the Premier League season resumes on 17 June. Kanté was granted compassionate leave after expressing concerns over coronavirus and has been working on his own at Chelsea’s training ground. However the midfielder, who has struggled with injuries this season, took part in phase two training with his teammates on Monday and Tuesday.\u0026nbspChelsea’s first game back is at Aston Villa on 21 June.

Experienced heads and goals are neededWhat\u0026nbspwas the situation when the Premier League was suspended on 13 March? Yet to win this year, the season was beginning to slip away from Graham Potter and his squad. They remain in a precarious position two points and three places above the relegation zone but the enforced break has at least earned some respite. Few clubs, if any, have been as transparent as Brighton during the lockdown period but there is no hiding from the task facing a team who have forgotten how to break down opponents. Too many players have flitted in and out of games but, when called on, Glenn Murray remains a trusty option and Neal Maupay is edging towards double figures in his first season in the top flight. The onus rests on Potter, given a six-year contract in November following an encouraging start, to turn things round.\u0026nbsp“All the games in this league are quite brutal,” he said after their last game three months ago, a stalemate at Wolves. “That’s the beauty of the challenge. We know we can play football and we have to do the nasty things well.”What about now? Aside from José Izquierdo, Brighton will resume at full strength. The 19-year-old Tariq Lamptey, a £3m January signing from Chelsea, is likely to make his debut as the games come thick and fast and in the Argentina-born Alexis Mac Allister, who provided a spark on debut off the bench at Molineux in March, they possess a useful wildcard. Things may get worse before they get better – they face Arsenal, Leicester and Manchester United in their next three matches – but Brighton rarely roll over, losing by a three-goal margin only once this season, at Manchester City in August. Brighton made it clear they opposed neutral venues and playing behind closed doors at the Amex Stadium at least means\u0026nbspPotter will have no problem making his voice heard. What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season?\u0026nbspBrighton have hardly been free-scoring but they equally need to stop the ball going in at the other end to give themselves a chance. They have conceded the opening goal in eight of their past 10 matches –\u0026nbspsix draws and four defeats since the turn of the year – and have kept only two clean sheets in their past 19. When they drew at Sheffield United in February, Potter acknowledged the opposition were more cohesive because of the understanding they have built over time, confirmation his side remain a work in progress. They have controlled plenty of games but Potter has often bemoaned fine margins going forward they are profligate and, at the back, too soft. A well-run club, Brighton have designs of establishing themselves as a top-10 team but they may have to temper their style to ensure their long-term future remains in the top ision.Have the players and staff behaved during lockdown? Impeccably. No one has even got a slap on the wrist.Any unsungcommunity heroes? Brighton arguably led the way in terms of charity efforts while the league was halted.\u0026nbspPlayers and directors raised more than £300,000 for the Albion As One fund, a campaign that has helped charities across Sussex, including Rise, a refuge that provides support to people affected by domestic abuse and violence. The club also delivered food parcels and reached out to more than 2,000 elderly supporters and the Amex\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspconverted into a drive-in Covid-19 testing centre. In between all that, the club pledged to donate 1,000 tickets to NHS workers (Bournemouth agreed to match their gesture) and they released a special-edition home shirt adorned with the words “Thank You NHS”, with all profits going to NHS charities. The winger Steven Alzate donated to a foundation supporting homeless and vulnerable people in\u0026nbspVillavicencio,\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspColombian city where his father, Hector, was born.Key player in the run-in? Aaron Connolly. The 20-year-old Republic of Ireland striker may not have scored since the double on his full league debut against Tottenham in October but, fit-again following ankle surgery, he will provide welcome zest and a nifty alternative to Maupay and the evergreen Murray.End-of-season prediction\u0026nbspPotter faces a challenge to find a winning formula with such a testing schedule but experienced heads could help Brighton keep their nerve: 18th."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d6f762d472f2cf1c8450344743afefb8144213d/0_177_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66d816c52e040a9658dc1c572b7fdb1e","title":"few venture out as lockdown eases in india","story":"Shops, banks, cafes and restaurants remain quiet as fear of the pandemic holds sway in New DelhiMany shops and restaurants are still deserted as India begins emerging from lockdown this week. Radha Dhongre, an economist, described going out for a coffee with her daughter on Monday in Khan Market in New Delhi, the Indian capital, the day the lockdown was eased as an experiment. Her trip was motivated by curiosity and a desire to see if it was feasible.Coffee was consumed outside while leaning against the bonnet of a car because the cafe was too small to allow social distancing. It was followed by a trip to the ATM, the purchase of some cosmetics (“Don’t touch the lipsticks or anything” warned the owner) and picking up a takeaway for lunch.“I’m glad we went but we aren’t doing it again for some time.\u0026nbspIt was too much for the nerves. We felt quite drained by the tension,” said Dhongre.It’s a view being echoed over large parts of India as the country emerges from its two-and-a-half month lockdown. Banks, shopping malls, cafes, and restaurants were still mostly deserted, with only a handful of customers. Many Indians prefer the security of the lockdown to the perils of venturing out.Although almost all the shops in the Community Centre in New Friends Colony were open, it still wore the eerie lockdown look for lack of customers. Sanitisers operated with a foot pedal were positioned outside the humblest store. “No mask, no entry” was pasted on doors. At the largely empty bank, a thermal gun checked temperatures.“This is the most dangerous time with the lockdown being lifted and cases exploding. I plan to be much more cautious than before,” said Ritesh Thakur who had come out to go to the bank.At the nearby fruit stall, the scene showed the mixed fate of the face mask. The owner wasn’t wearing one, his wife kept pulling hers down to speak, and their teenage son let his droop below his mouth, or maybe the elastic had gone. This, despite the fact that India is recording almost 10,000 new infections every day.In New Delhi, Mumbai and other cities, the traffic jams are back. With buses allowing only about a third of the normal passengers in a city with the population density of Mumbai, workers had a miserable time getting home. “I’ve been waiting for three hours,” a man at a bus stop told a TV channel.In the past week, some people have been spooked by widely exchanged videos and posts depicting the ordeal of families running around hospitals for a bed and of some private hospitals demanding extortionate fees as a pre-condition for admission.The message accompanying the videos is invariably: “Continue the lockdown. For the government, you are only a number. For your family, you are the whole world.”“It’s not so much fear of the virus as fear of a loved one not being able to get treatment that’s frightening,” said a woman in the chemist at the community centre.\u0026nbspPlaces of worship across the country too saw only a trickle of visitors amid strict social distancing rules.Not many Delhi residents will be encouraged to resume normal life given the figures coming out. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia (chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is to be tested for Covid-19) said on Tuesday that cases were doubling every fortnight.He added that this meant the current figure of 30,000 coronavirus cases would soar to well over half a million by 31 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdb0d41be244598a3336d102e7a8fb47761aa505/0_50_5152_3091/master/5152.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=340337b2f7e4d525746264e16baaed58","title":"uk households face 6bn debts because of covid 19 says charity","story":"Debt fuelled by pandemic and job losses will stifle nation’s recovery, StepChange claimsBritish households are expected to rack up debts worth a combined £6bn because of the coronavirus crisis, as millions of people fall behind on credit card payments, council tax and utility bills.Sounding the alarm as the economic fallout from the health emergency mounts, the StepChange debt advice charity said 4.6m households risked building up dangerous levels of debt because of the pandemic.The charity warned that debts racked up during the crisis would stifle the country’s economic recovery and that debt advisory services would be deluged once the reality of people’s situations began to hit home in the coming months.In response to the looming national debt crisis, the Treasury said it was pumping an additional £38m of funding into debt advice services to help manage a flood of new arrears cases.John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: “We know that some people are struggling with their finances during this difficult time, which is why we want to make sure people can access the help and support they need to manage their debts and get their finances back on track.”StepChange said debt charities were gearing up for a doubling of demand for their services as Covid-19 and lockdown measures triggered rising job losses and reduced working hours and pay.According to a study carried out by the organisation, each affected adult will have accumulated an additional\u0026nbsp£1,076 of arrears and £997 of debt on average each because of the health crisis. StepChange said 4.6m households had been affected so far.But despite the mounting risk of financial hardship, many people have saved money during the early stages of the pandemic, as lockdown has prevented them from eating and drinking out, visiting most shops and commuting to work.Amid the biggest-ever fall in consumer spending, UK households repaid a record £7.4bn of debt on credit cards and personal loans in April, according to Bank of England figures. Household bank deposits jumped by £16.2bn, more than triple the average monthly rise.The savings boom has, however, been uneven. According to the Resolution Foundation, as many as two in five high-income families have experienced budget gains in the crisis, comparedwith one in eight low-income households.StepChange\u0026nbspsaid that since the beginning of lockdown in late March, as many as\u0026nbsp1.2 million people had fallen behind on utility bill payments, 820,000 people on council tax, and 590,000 on rent.\u0026nbspAround 4.2 million people had borrowed to make ends meet,\u0026nbspmostly by using a credit card, overdraft or a high-cost product such as a payday loan.\u0026nbspAccording to the charity, as many as 2.7 million people have used payment holidays on mortgages and credit products that were brought in after talks between ministers and the banking industry.The government has extended payment holidays on mortgages by three months. The scheme was announced in March to help borrowers in financial difficulty because of the health crisis, and was due to expire at the end of June before it was extended by a further three months. The deadline for applying for an extension was also shifted to 31 October.The Financial Times reported on Monday that talks with banks were in progress about extending the break for those struggling to repay credit card debts. However, StepChange said more flexible terms would still be needed once the holidays ended to prevent a “cliff edge” for people who needed to start paying back their debts.Phil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange, said: “We were already dealing with a debt crisis, but Covid has so far added another four million people and counting to the number who are going to need help finding their way back to financial health.“This is a problem that isn’t going to solve itself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e4882cc6ccb455cff564b0842aecae0ebcc6a41/0_116_3158_1893/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fc458a40eaab0565f1aab63d9841dcc","title":"bonnie pointer country to disco pointer sisters","story":"As one of the original Pointer Sisters, Bonnie Pointer, who has died aged 69, brilliantly wrongfooted her audience by hopping from blaxploitation films to NashvilleThere were effectively two different versions of the Pointer Sisters. There was the 80s hit machine, a trio whose sound existed somewhere between soul and shiny synth-pop, authors of the ubiquitous I’m So Excited and Jump (For My Love). And there was the Pointer Sisters that existed before them, when Bonnie Pointer was still a member, who were a very different and far more intriguing proposition: a quartet, dressed in a chaotic, charity-shop approximation of 1940s glamour, whose sound zigzagged wittily and unpredictably between jazz, soul, blues and country.They could make music that matched their outfits, sounding like an African-American equivalent of the Manhattan Transfer, or of Bette Midler belting out The Lullaby of Broadway and Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy to the delight of the patrons of New York’s Continental Baths. Alternatively, they could turn out a tough take on Willie Dixon’s Wang Dang Doodle or the humid New Orleans funk of Allen Toussaint’s Yes We Can Can. They could do disco, as on 1977’s Waiting on You equally, they could win a Grammy for the best country performance by a duo or group, as they did for Fairytale (1974). They had hits, but they were nowhere near as commercially successful as their latter incarnation, perhaps because the 70s version of the Pointer Sisters kept wrongfooting their audience, or rather their audiences: there may have been some crossover between the crowd who bought tickets to see the post-blaxploitation comedy Car Wash – in which they appeared serenading Richard Prior’s corrupt evangelist Daddy Rich – and those who turned up to see them play Nashville’s Grand Ol’ Opry, the first black vocal group ever to do so, but it doesn’t seem terribly likely.It was Bonnie Pointer who formed the band, initially as a duo with youngest sister June, before elder siblings Anita and Ruth joined. They worked as backing vocalists for an eclectic range of San Francisco-based artists – Boz Scaggs, Sylvester, Jefferson Airplane’s Grace Slick – and recorded a couple of singles for Atlantic: Don’t Try to Take the Fifth and Destination No More Heartaches. The A-sides were solid if unremarkable examples of early-70s soul, but the B-side of the latter, Send Him Back, had a distinctly retro flavour that meant it was eventually rediscovered by northern soul DJs.But it wasn’t until they signed to Blue Thumb that the Pointer Sisters came into their own. It was an impressively eclectic label – its roster included Captain Beefheart and Sun Ra, and it gamely attempted to interest America in the Pointer Sisters’ former employer, Sylvester and the Hot Band, audiences proving resistant to the idea of an androgynous black man belting out Neil Young’s Southern Man in high heels – and the Pointer Sisters’ stylistic rethink made them fit right in.The 40s affectations were surprisingly timely – fashion was undergoing a retro moment that found its expression everywhere from women’s platform shoes and halter dresses to the GI look sported by Bryan Ferry – and their stage show was campily theatrical enough that San Francisco’s Opera House, previously closed to pop artists, hosted a performance by them (captured on a 1974 live album). Both their eponymous debut, which featured backing from another Blue Thumb act, the blues-rockers Hoodoo Rhythm Devils, and its follow-up, That’s A-Plenty, went gold in the US.But even Blue Thumb seemed startled when Anita and Bonnie wrote Fairytale, a song inspired in equal part by Jackson Browne and the country songs they remembered being sung by their older relatives, who had moved from Arkansas to California. Blue Thumb lacked a country department to promote it, so handed it over to their sister label, Dot. It made the country charts, won a Grammy and was subsequently covered by Elvis Presley.The band toyed with making a country album, but instead recorded Steppin’ – home to both a medley of Duke Ellington songs and How Long (Betcha Gotta Chick on the Side), a superb funk track again co-written by Anita and Bonnie that became another hit. On the surface, Having a Party (1977) appeared more straightforward, dialling down the swing-era influences, but was still both witty – “Take off your socks, I don’t wanna see no socks, baby” protested the fabulously slinky Don’t It Drive You Crazy – and musically varied: disco next to old Sam Cooke covers and the reggae-inspired I’ll Get By Without You.The following year, Bonnie Pointer married Temptations and Chairmen of the Board producer Jeffrey Bowen and was spirited away for a solo career on Motown, under his aegis. The Pointer Sisters were never the same again, although you could occasionally detect a hint of their old eclecticism – they had a hit with the Bruce Springsteen song, Fire, and there was definitely a country song lurking somewhere beneath the production gloss of their 1981 ballad Slow Hand.Motown, meanwhile, appeared slightly at a loss as to what to do with Bonnie Pointer. The big idea on her two albums for the label seemed to be getting her to record disco versions of the label’s vintage hits – Jimmy Mack, Nowhere to Run (Nowhere to Hide) – with Pointer multitracking the vocal harmonies. It was an approach that yielded a solo hit with an updated version of the Elgins’ Heaven Must Have Sent You, but it gave them a whiff of novelty and meant the fresh material she performed was overshadowed. The best track on either album was Free Me from My Freedom, mid-tempo disco complete with an unlikely banjo solo, that was given a particularly fantastic extended 12-inch version, but it failed to cross over from the clubs to the chart. Radio programmers were apparently put off by the lyrics’ vague undercurrent of S\u0026ampM.Pointer fell into contractual dispute with Motown and didn’t release another album for five years: the sense that If the Price Is Right (1984) was an attempt to mimic the style that had brought her sisters multi-platinum success was hard to escape, although she remained a live draw for the rest of her life, performing in Vegas and Atlantic City and sporadically reuniting with her sisters on stage. Her final album, Like a Picasso (2011), had its moments – the single Strangest Day was an impressively raw rock-soul hybrid, decorated with bluesy harmonica. But her reputation rests on the music she made in the 70s, particularly with the Pointer Sisters, back when you never quite knew what the Pointer Sisters would do next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0896836e751358a0ad66bf10af308ec503b1887/0_106_2796_1677/master/2796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ce66eb3493d14868c9cb9ca43871ee0","title":"is british theatre about to go out of business","story":"Every year, 34 million people go to the theatre, double the number that attend Premier League football.

It is clear from our research that this simply isn’t the case – indeed, the system as it stands is not fit for purpose,” King said.“This is the critical moment for the government to act now or risk further spikes. We believe that a new approach is required, one that moves away from a centralised system that utilises a local-first approach. We are calling on the government to urgently rethink their course to ensure that we have a system in place that will help and not hinder the country’s recovery.”Independent Sage is a group of 12 leading scientists\u0026nbspwho have been critical of the government’s handling of the pandemic. It was set up partly in response to a lack of transparency around the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The membership of Sage and minutes and documents relating to its meetings have since been published.The independent group’s report points out that the epidemic is still growing in some parts of the country, such as north-west England. They say erosion of trust in the government in recent weeks will make it less likely that people will comply if they are called by contact-tracers and told they must self-isolate.It argues for a more comprehensive system than just test and trace. The report says it should be “find, test, trace, isolate and support”. Speed is vital: the scientists point out that Sage itself advised that the aim should be to isolate as many contacts as possible within 48 hours.Test results should be available within 24 hours, says Independent Sage. Those who are isolated should have financial support and accommodation provided if they need it.

Barely a gym lets a cross-training machine go unaccompanied by hi-NRG dance tunes. There’s a great choice of running playlists on Spotify, some with millions of likes from users who’ve found that the right music can push them farther and faster. Bruce Springsteen has even written a whole album about being born to run. But if you want to use music to help improve your running, it’s important to get to grips with the science, and how it applies to your running style.Given that most runners tend to follow a pace of 150 to 180 steps per minute, you need music that corresponds to that. One option is to pick music that has about 150-180bpm, so that you can match your steps to the beat. “Foo Fighters’ The Pretender, which has about 170bpm, is really, really popular with runners,” says Hallett.However, 150-180bpm is very fast in terms of tempo, so there’s relatively little recorded at those speeds – with the exception of more high-energy rock’n’roll, thrash metal or speed garage. So another option is to aim for music that matches your stride cycle – ie two steps rather than one. This lets you pick music that’s much slower. Something that’s particularly good? Hip-hop.One of the most pleasant ways to run is to do so in what’s known as a “flow state”. It’s a highly enjoyable feeling of being completely immersed in what you’re doing to the point where it’s as though you’re on autopilot, but which is in itself highly enjoyable. It’s also been shown to enhance running endurance.Karageorghis did a study where he ran people to exhaustion during a beep test and found that those who listened to music more easily entered flow state. But in order to enter flow state, it’s important to have the right listening experience. The more continuous the listening experience, the easier it is to enter flow state. So if you’re planning to go on a reasonably lengthy run, it’s best to avoid music with ads, and to ensure you’re not listening in a way that might be interrupted by poor signal. Using Spotify Premium, with ad-free music and offline listening, is one way to keep the flow state flowing, if you will. “Having interrupted music can be a little distracting and disconcerting – it’s not as beneficial as having continuous music,” says Karageorghis. “That’s why I often encourage people to create end-to-end playlists that contour their workout.”One of the most important ways that music can help take your running to the next level is by making you feel less tired when you exercise. When you’re listening to a soundtrack, you’re giving your brain something to process other than your physical activity. The music distracts it from focusing on the effect exercise is having on your body, so the parts of the brain that speak to each other to communicate fatigue are less able to do so – meaning you feel less exhausted than you otherwise would.“It’s as though the music takes up some of your brain’s bandwidth that would normally be used for communication with the working muscles and the organs,” says Karageorghis. “It limits the degree to which fatigue-related signals can enter conscious awareness.”One thing that is unaffected by how fast you’re running is music’s ability to make you feel like you’re enjoying yourself. Even at higher intensities, studies have found that music can make people enjoy exercise more than they otherwise would.Karageorghis has also found that not only does music enhance how pleasurable your run is, but it enhances your memory of your run. It makes you remember your runs more positively, associates them more with being positive experiences and increases your probability of running more frequently. As to the right type of music to ensure that your brain responds positively to running? That depends entirely on you.“It’s often to do with the personal associations that the music has for you,” says Hallett. “I had a participant who listened to music from their university days because it took them back to a time when they had less responsibility. Going on a run felt like a bit of escapism for them. Others were motivated by music that reminded them of people they knew. It depends what has meaning to you.”Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

How have your feelings about him and his legacy changed over the years?\u0026nbspMy feelings towards him and his legacy haven’t changed. If anything they have strengthened in pursuit of his efforts and aspirations for a more united, respectful and equitable society. His assassination was heartbreaking and was a deliberate act to silence civil rights progress and the wider rallying condemnation of social injustice and racial inequality. He led marches and in 2020 many new people are stepping up to inspire our generation to be counted and make their voices heard. Black Lives Matter. Equality Matters. Racism has no place in our world today or in the future.\u0026nbspYou first played King at the Young Vic in 2016, directed by Roy Alexander Weise. The Young Vic is now run by Kwame Kwei-Armah, and Roy is co-artistic director at the Royal Exchange. How must theatre change to ensure continued ersity?\u0026nbspPerpetuating whiteness across institutions and organisations can no longer be the norm.\u0026nbspMany people from black and ethic minority backgrounds are brilliant and for years have been specialising in roles across the sector. We need to be given room, trust and support where necessary to continue to excel, in order to impact the collective identity, non-biased culture and social impact of inclusivity across the sector. Members of the board and senior management need to be from erse backgrounds with complementary skills and\u0026nbsphave regular reviews of progressive thinking as part of\u0026nbspthe operating model of organisations.The play takes place after King has given his mountaintop speech. How closely did you study King’s speeches, and what is it about that one that makes it so resonant?\u0026nbspI’ve listened to that speech and watched it several times on YouTube, but I still can’t quote it word for word. I do remember him saying it’s all right to tell a man to lift himself up by his own bootstrap but it’s a cruel jest to tell a bootless man to lift himself up by his bootstrap. Our destinies are all tied up together, and it’s all our concern that fairness and prosperity are principles we all need to subscribe to for the sake of all humanity.\u0026nbspThe Mountaintop explores different styles of civil rights protest in the US in 1968. Fifty years later, in the UK, how do you view those contrasting approaches?\u0026nbspI heard someone say that white people are lucky black people just want equality not revenge. It’s all relevant.Katori Hall explores the reality behind King as a mythical figure and also uses elements of the supernatural. What makes her writing so special?\u0026nbspKatori’s writing is special because it dares to acknowledge that different plains of belief exist in our understanding of culture and where we draw strength. King is a black man of God. I don’t know of Katori’s spiritual beliefs, but in The Mountaintop she generously explores how the weight and fatigue of the struggle can enhance insight and the inspiration of conviction.The play is a two-hander. Camae, the young woman who visits King, is brilliantly drawn and feels like an under-represented character in theatre. Do you think there are certain stories that UK theatre has largely failed to represent?\u0026nbspA character like Camae is certainly a good example, but I would say that UK theatre needs to not relegate those stories to small theatre spaces, regional theatres or small organisations. Many under-represented stories and experiences exist, and those stories need to be seen on big stages and should be part of the narratives of international exports and given wider visibility.\u0026nbspHow does theatre’s lockdown pose a risk to ersity?\u0026nbspMany people of colour do not trust the sector or the institutions. The feeling is that unconscious biases will mean that only the roles that white people occupy will be retained. Many already disenfranchised creatives of colour and freelance artists will be even more under-represented and pushed out meaning moving away from the industry completely. The social economics of people being priced out of buildings and shows will persist, and audiences and auditoriums will become devastatingly whitewashed.\u0026nbspYou’re an actor, director and writer – which brings you the greatest satisfaction?They also speak to each other and are very much about the journey I’m on. I have maintained that to a certain extent. I have tried to express myself in all disciplines to maintain my visibility and to inspire others to express their creative talents in a multitude of ways. In my current role as artistic director of Brixton House, I’m very excited by how we can satisfy the support artists want us to offer in order to secure their involvement in the success of our theatre and their journey in a polarising industry and the current perilous artistic environment.\u0026nbspThe Mountaintop began its 2018 tour at the Nuffield in Southampton, which has now gone into administration. At this moment of crisis, how can the industry be protected? That’s a huge question and many people are working very hard to find solutions, and it’s important for people that look like me with better understanding of actionable plans to be a part of those discussions, in order to maintain a erse pool of narratives and financial contributions for the security of our industry.\u0026nbspYour reading of the play comes amid global protests about the killing of George Floyd. What in particular can this play do at this moment?\u0026nbspI believe Katori wrote the play as a reflection piece on the sacrifices of our ancestors and great leaders using MLK as a principled pioneer of collective thinking that inspired generations to stand up against racial injustice and inequality in society. In order for us all to see what he saw on that mountaintop we need to still walk together because the summit is yet to be reached.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b89cce47e98018f4efa14318da775f61ba29e291/0_318_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a25fc215f105dd6e536a671a226b45f","title":"10 best latin american south american novels magic realism","story":"From the magic realism of the tropics to the ‘gritty city’, Latin American literature is as rich and beguiling as the region itselfA sense of place often has a political edge in Latin American writing. Even magic realism – which takes fantastic liberties with the contours of cities and pueblos, jungles and rivers – is rooted in the living, breathing, dying and warring world of its characters. Over five centuries, Hiic authors have loaned from and contested European ideas about their world, adapting imported traditions (from naturalism to crime fiction to stream-of-consciousness) and reworking them to bring to life the vibrancy and vicissitudes of their youthful continent. The best novels are as alluring and stimulating as the most atmospheric places. To choose just 10 was only possible by imagining I was packing for a long road trip with limited baggage. I would take these, a comfortable hammock and a sturdy pillow.In literature, before the Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 70s there was a fashion for “regionalist” writing – books that treated their setting almost as a character. Venezuela’s steamy llanos (plains) are the backdrop to this 1929 novel about a strong woman in a world of rough ranchers and cowboys. Gallegos details every tremble of palm frond, every ripple of skulking alligator. The novel, somewhat forgotten but a classic, inspired many of the later magic realists. In 1948 its author became president in what is widely regarded as Venezuela’s first legitimate election. Some critics have said the character of Doña Bárbara anticipated Eva Perón, while Hugo Chávez was wont to call George W Bush “Señor Peligro”, or “Mr Danger”, after the novel’s imperialist villain.This accomplished historical novel, published in 1998, retells the story of the abduction of Jemmy Button and three other indigenous Fuegians by Captain Robert Fitzroy of HMS Beagle. The story moves from the large island at the southern tip of Argentina (and South America) to England – where an attempt is made to civilise Button – and, finally, to the Falkland Islands. Iparraguirre’s portrait of London is convincingly Dickensian, but even more stirring are the “dark forests” and rocky shores of Tierra del Fuego, the lonely home of the “oldest winter in the world”.The Colombian city of Cartagena, once a major Spanish garrison and key port of Spain’s Caribbean fleet, is now often swamped by cruise ship passengers and, in the modern parlance, is possibly Latin America’s most Instagrammable location. Love in the Time of Cholera, published in 1985, taps this romanticism in its story of a late-requited love, its fictional location evoking Cartagena’s pastel-painted facades, as well as sections of the nearby city of Barranquilla on the Magdalena River. With its aromatic mangos, riverboats and loquacious parrot, it’s an archetypal South American tale, but it’s also highly inventive, laced with delicious irony while riffing on multiple literary genres.\u0026nbspThe Chilean author’s extraordinary 1982 debut novel sweeps across three generations of the Valle-Trueba family in an unnamed country (blatantly Chile), and tempers its political sloganeering and supernatural flights with keen psychological observations. The story of class struggles is still relevant and Clara (who possesses paranormal powers), Blanca and Alba Trueba – the mother, daughter and granddaughter who preside over the titular house – are always engaging company, as they flit between the sprawl of Santiago and surrounding agricultural heartland.This is a raw, rude, angry novel. Its main character, Pedro Juan, is a slightly nasty, very funny, self-confessed scumbag, who scratches a living flogging knock-off lobsters and fixing sewage pipes – probably without washing his hands between jobs. He has the sexual appetite of a penned-in young bull, and loves to ulge his colourful, rum-soaked seductions on the rooftop in the company of working women. The novel’s local colour is not the standard Cuban cliche of vintage cars and salsa, but the hurricane-damaged reality of ruinous old mansions where the lifts stopped working decades ago and the staircases are deathtraps. The novel, first published in 1998, remains largely unavailable in Cuba, though it wasn’t formally banned.\u0026nbspIn prose as tangled as a tropical rainforest, this intricate, ambitious 1966 novel by the Peruvian Nobel laureate tells a story of tinpot politicos, prostitutes, soldiers, cops, nuns, priests, river pilots, rubber merchants, gold prospectors and other outback characters – indigenous, mestizo and white – in a great arc of plots and subplots that link the remote riverine city of Iquitos with the coastal desert of north-west Peru. The green house of the title is the Amazon, as well as a brothel outside the city of Piura. It’s not an easy read – Vargas Llosa was a “high modernist” in his early works – but if you let the long, impressionistic sentences wrap themselves around you, you’ll enjoy the journey.Admired by Ernest Hemingway for its depictions of local scenery, this English-language novel, published in 1885 (the original title was The Purple Land that England Lost), narrates a Victorian expat’s South American fantasy (Hudson was born in Argentina to US settlers of English and Irish origin). Richard Lamb is an Englishman who marries a young Argentinian woman without her father’s permission before crossing the river to Uruguay, where he gets mixed up with some messy gaucho wars – and some messy local women. Full of action and drama, it captures the historical tumult of the Río de la Plata region during the mid-19th century and works as a kind of allegory of civilisation and barbarism. Hudson, a fine naturalist and superb ornithologist, brings the landscape of estancias and rolling plains, rheas and deer, cattle and horses fully to life. Jorge Luis Borges likened the book to Homer’s Odyssey for its “elemental” power.\u0026nbspThe six “Bahian Novels” of Brazil’s best-known writer mix a kind of social realism with elements of fable, but are free of the sentimentalism and exoticism of his later works. This story, the final work in the cycle published in 1937, follows the pursuits of a gang of homeless orphans and urchins around the cobbled squares and slums of Salvador, a “city black and old”. While rich in local colour – no one knows a city like a street kid – the novel, as Colm Tóibín writes in the introduction to the Penguin Classics edition, “is not written for tourists it is written to give substance to shadows, to recreate the underlife of the city, to offer the dispossessed and reviled an inner life.”\u0026nbspI loved Mario Vargas Llosa’s The Feast of the Goat – about the last days of Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo – but for a more upbeat and contemporary mental trip to the country , it’s got to be one of Junot Díaz’s books. This 2012 collection of inter-linked stories works as a loose kind of novel, with the chief character, Yunior de las Casas, ulging his many infidelities from his late teens well into adulthood, on trips “home” as well as in his adopted New Jersey. The joys and pains of the immigrant experience and Latino family life are skilfully wrought in punchy, streetwise prose through all the stories, “the Island” exerts a powerful pull on body as well as mind.\u0026nbspIf you want to visit the Buenos Aires of guidebook cliche, don’t read this. Published in 2005, the novel unfolds in the Cascade Heights Country Club, a gated estate outside the Argentinian capital where wealthy families live like Europeans – while beyond the walls society is riven by crime and poverty, and the economy is tanking. When three men are murdered in mysterious circumstances, the suburban fantasy is punctured. The figurative “widows” of the title are the wives whose husbands spend Thursday nights playing cards and drinking. A great thriller,\u0026nbspThursday Night Widows\u0026nbspis also a dark parable about systemic violence and the criminality that underpins keeping up appearances.\u0026nbsp This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Though it masqueraded as low-key and unfussy, a show that simply eavesdropped on blind dates, its approach was more high-concept than it first appeared. One person went on five dates, then chose their favourite for a second date. So far, so familiar. But the editing made it all look as if it took place on the same night, in a sort of hopeful-romantic Groundhog Day. And so each date took place at the same place, in the same clothes, often with the same questions and jokes. These were edited to look as if they were all happening at once, and it was borderline arthouse. If it was supposed to be a comment on the repetitive grind of modern dating, then it was a surprisingly effective one.Still, despite its conspicuous oddness, it was more subtle and less flashy than other shows of its ilk. It may be high-concept, but that concept isn’t a grand one – there’s no abstinence from sex for money, no agreement to marry without first seeing the person you intend to marry. It’s simply a date, over drinks and dinner, with the prospect of another date at the end of it. It let conversations linger, it waited to see if a kiss might be initiated in the back of a cab, fully embracing the awkwardness of that particular dance, and it let incompatible couples come to the realisation that they were not meant to be at an excruciatingly authentic pace. At just 30 minutes or so, it was entirely compelling. It felt right at home in the age of apps. The dates were not surface (at least not by design, though sometimes they ended up that way), but they were brisk, efficient. If not quite the equivalent of a swipe left or right on TV, then it is right at home in a culture in which that is normalised.For this second season, the show has moved from New York to New Orleans, which seems a smart move in terms of adding variety, given that dating in the US appears to be hyper-localised. (As a non-American who has never experienced American dating, the customs are an endless source of fascination and wonder.) As before, it is broken into three sections: drinks, dinner and after hours, should it get that far, which either takes in a second bar or a cab ride. The benefit of a return visit is that there is no need for adjustment this time. We know exactly what’s about to happen, and why a date is cutting between five different partners, despite the same setting and clothing, and it’s easy to jump right in.The season opens with Justin, a 31-year-old who works in finance. Every episode begins with friends offering recommendations and analysis. Deva is raw from heartbreak, Ben is a smiling, nervous “diamond in the rough”. In Justin’s case, he dates party girls, which means he hasn’t yet found the one with whom he can settle down. The five women he meets run the gamut of dates, good, bad, and just not right. Lilly, 26, is a true character, who arrives with a declaration that “my armpits are sweaty right now”, and continues to flummox Justin with how upfront she is, particularly when it comes to talking about her body. “You have a personality that I’ve never encountered,” he tells her, stunned, but without unkindness.\u0026nbspDating Around is sometimes exposing, but always kind. Brandon, a kindergarten director, goes on one date in which the lack of common ground is so plain from the beginning that it becomes a kind of competition, in which cigarettes and blue cheese are the battle lines. Even then, the kiss off is a “I feel like we’re on different pages”, and not a for-the-camera kick to the kerb. Part of the pleasure in watching this is trying to second-guess what will happen next, to spot the chemistry and the pitfalls before the daters spot it themselves. I’ve become an expert at analysing the conversations about exes. If it’s casual and frank, it is usually a promising sign. If it’s awkward or stilted, or still pulsating with pain, then they might not even get to the cab stage. How different people react to the same story is telling, too: one woman, Demi, who likes bad boys, recalls taking a butterknife to a date. Some of her partners found it funny, some perplexing, and I found myself rooting for the one who understood why she might have to consider her safety with a stranger who knew where she lived.Despite the inherent sameness of the set-up, Dating Around feels fresh with each episode. Its casting is erse, and this opens the door to frank conversations that are rarely heard in these kinds of shows. Justin talks about women who treat him as an Asian stereotype. Deva is bisexual and her dates include men and women, with no comment or fanfare. It is depressing that this should be so noteworthy, but at least it is refreshing, and makes it feel contemporary. My main issue is that there is little in the way of “what happened next”, other than a quick compilation of clips of the very beginning of the second date. Here, the rules of romance dictate that to progress, one must move to picnics and cycling trips and museum visits. I want to know if it worked out beyond the daylight meet-up. It feels cruel to leave us hanging."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82f9a882b186d063ddbd511b3beaf5d1af40dc3e/0_177_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=05096b2f98988f2f4e158a24d6091105","title":"a beautiful day new zealand handshakes and hugs its way back to pre covid 19 life","story":"There may be tough economic times, and fresh cases, ahead but for now New Zealanders can enjoy a day free of coronavirus restrictions“I just had a meeting with someone and I thought, ‘Do I shake your hand?’” says Casey Allum, who was among those flocking to eat lunch at Wellington’s sunny, sparkling waterfront on Tuesday. Handshakes had been verboten until midnight on Monday, as people were required to stay a metre apart from colleagues, or two metres from strangers.“Then he came in with the handshake,” Allum says. “And I thought, ‘Oh sweet, that’s easy’.”New Zealanders woke on Tuesday to no restrictions on their daily lives for the first time since 21 March, with all remaining rules lifted after the country’s last known case of Covid-19 recovered from the virus. People in a nation that appears to have vanquished the coronavirus – for the time being – were permitted to hug and kiss strangers, to stand shoulder to shoulder at rock concerts, pray in large groups at mosques and churches, attend rugby games and throw large wedding parties or funerals.Strict border controls remain, with New Zealanders and their families the only people permitted to enter the country. They must remain in government-run quarantine for 14 days.The announcement by prime minister Jacinda Ardern that all other rules would be lifted at midnight – earlier than expected – sparked joy for many. Juliet Gerrad, the prime minister’s chief science advisor said she was enjoying “a cheeky midnight single malt” at the time the restrictions were officially removed. Others posted images of fireworks and wished each other a “happy new year.”\u0026nbspWhile no one was openly hugging in the streets on Tuesday, those walking outdoors were giddy with pleasure at the new status. The daring even pushed pedestrian crosswalk buttons with their hands, rather than the crouched elbow-jab New Zealanders have resorted to during the pandemic.\u0026nbsp“A little cheer” went up in Scott Harris’ office, where he and his central Wellington colleagues had held a “watching party” for Ardern’s news conference. He was most excited about returning to his favourite game.“Me and my mates run a lacrosse club,” he says, adding that it was “quite hard to run a contact sport with one-metre distancing.”Bars and nightclubs are also readying themselves for perhaps the most raucous Tuesday night they might ever have, as rules requiring patrons to remain seated and physically distanced, receiving only table service, were jettisoned.Kieran O’Malley’s staff at the Fork \u0026amp Brewer pub had spent the morning dragging furniture from storage ready to boost their capacity to its pre-pandemic 250 people, instead of the 100 the bar was permitted to accommodate during the later stages of Covid-19 restrictions.\u0026nbsp“It’s a godsend,” he says, adding that turnover had been “down by half” under the physical distancing rules. The government had made the right decision in shutting the country down, O’Malley says, but it had been tough and his business had needed more support.\u0026nbsp“Now we’re back to normal,” he says. “But it’s going to be a while before we build confidence back again.”In the window of one central Wellington gift shop on Tuesday, a quirky shrine to “Saint Ashley” has been erected Ashley Bloomfield, the even-mannered, often cautious health official has become a household name during the crisis, with his face printed on tea towels and turned into heroic memes online.Bloomfield, after reporting that 1,053 Covid-19 tests processed the day before had uncovered no new cases, says with a rare smile that it was “a beautiful day in Wellington”.But he warns that New Zealand has not seen the last of the pandemic.“We know this will happen,” he says, referring to the prospect of fresh diagnoses. “It may be that we detect a case at the border … we may even find cases still here on our community onshore.”Ardern has voiced her anger at learning The Warehouse, a locally owned big box retail chain, was considering more than 1,000 job cuts which the company said had been accelerated by the pandemic.\u0026nbsp“I do think they are a company that has promoted themselves as being in the community and for the community,” Ardern said, adding that many smaller businesses had resisted job losses.Knowing that victory might only be temporary did not take the gloss off for New Zealanders: both the capital’s and Christchurch’s daily newspapers feature a full-page cartoon on their covers, with a kiwi – the flightless bird – standing atop a number one, delineating New Zealand’s lowest alert level number, as spectators look on in awe.\u0026nbspThe weather report reads: “A fine, still day to welcome in level 1 and all the freedoms we used to take for granted.”Betrothed couples turned their attention again to their weddings, with restrictions limiting gatherings to 100 people lifted.“I’ve already had two of the brides who were thinking about it come to me and say, ‘We can set a date and get on with it,’” says Julie Lassen, a Christchurch-based celebrant, adding that even though couples could not invite overseas guests, some had decided to proceed anyway. “It’s made a huge difference because now everyone can relax and hug each other.”The lifting of rules was good news, too, for fans of New Zealand’s most beloved sport, rugby. The domestic competition will be the first professional rugby competition in the world to welcome fans en masse to sports grounds in the Covid-19 era when games kick off in Auckland and Dunedin this weekend. Stadiums are permitted to be filled to capacity.But public health experts still worry about the state of the country’s contact tracing.The country has seen fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases and 22 deaths after Ardern locked down New Zealand at the 200-case mark. Most say that despite the country’s seeming lucky escape from Covid-19, they would return to normal life with slightly cleaner hands than before.“We’re spraying and sanitising lots. It’s great to see every guy in the toilets washing their hands,” says bar manager O’Malley. “People sanitising their hands is great. Why not keep doing it?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdc3e5ad1eb586dd591a63d01a5f3a95d21e2a57/0_17_3375_2026/master/3375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c51ef5faff35d46dcd5c76146a2ee90b","title":"brazil coronavirus parties","story":"A doctor was savagely beaten when she objected to one of the many shindigs taking place in defiance of health experts’ adviceFor weeks, the booze-soaked, coronavirus-themed parties had raged over the road from Ticyana Azambuja’s home in Rio de Janeiro, until finally she snapped.She picked up a hammer, marched across the street and used it to smash the rear windshield and Union Jack-patterned wing mirror of a reveller’s car.“I just wanted them to come out and listen to me. I’d pay to fix the car, but they needed to understand how ridiculous it was to be throwing those parties day and night … right in the middle of a pandemic,” the 35-year-old said.Azambuja’s moment of fury was understandable, if illegal: an anaesthetist, she has spent the last three months battling to save lives on the frontline of Brazil’s fight against Covid-19 – even catching the disease herself.On 30 May, the day she lost her cool, she had been trying to rest after a gruelling 24-hour shift at one of the three hospitals where she works.The organizers of the bacchanalia showed no compassion.“They came out to kill me,” Azambuja recalled of the vicious assault she suffered at the hands of several enraged partygoers, which was filmed by a neighbour. She was knocked unconscious and suffered fractures to her knee, neck and hands.As neighbours rushed the doctor to hospital, the festivities went on.“Every day I’m faced with life or death. I just cannot understand how these people can manage to have fun when so many people are dying,” Azambuja said as Brazil overtook Italy as the country with the third-highest Covid-19 death toll.Her case was an extreme one but the party – where guests were reportedly given customized cups featuring the image of a pistol and the words “Baile do Covid-19” (“The Covid-19 Dance”) – was far from an aberration.Even as Brazil’s coronavirus death toll has soared to more than 37,000, illicit shindigs have been reported from southern cities such as Curitiba to the Amazon in the north.In Rio, where more than 6,000 people have died, a crime hotline has received 700 calls reporting underground parties since the pandemic began – many of them bailes funk (funk dance parties) in the favelas. On Friday a luxury yacht with at least 20 people onboard could be seen moored off Rio’s chic south zone, music blaring.“I’ve seen lots of parties like that,” said a resident of Urca, where the city’s Yacht Club is located.The organizers of one recent rave called Pool Party Secrets asked guests to come in face masks. None did. According to an anonymous Instagram account which denounced the gathering, guests included lawyers, members of the military, two dentists, three nurses and even two doctors from one of Brazil’s biggest private hospital chains.In São Paulo, where more than 8,000 people have died, funk parties have continued in many favelas such as Água Vermelha in the city’s east. “The parties are still happening when I’m heading out to work,” said one local man, a gravedigger who buries Covid-19 victims while the revelry goes on.In Porto Velho, capital of the Amazon state of Rondônia, police are investigating two recent blowouts where coronavirus carriers allegedly danced the night away. “They weren’t working … they were having fun – they were putting their lives at risk – and the lives of those of you who are following the governor’s quarantine order,” the state health secretary, Fernando Máximo, fumed in an online video.“If you see anyone throwing parties … report them. Call the police,” Máximo said.Even the president, Jair Bolsonaro, has broken health ministry regulations to have fun – attending a barbecue at a ranch in Brazil’s midwest on the morning of Azambuja’s attack where he was photographed hobnobbing with a crooner whose hits include a song called the Castle of Dreams.Flávio Dino, a leftist governor and prominent Bolsonaro opponent, said it was unsurprising efforts to keep Brazilians indoors were gradually crumbling when the president set such an example.“When a governor says A, and the president of the republic says B, and A and B are utterly contradictory then of course you can’t keep up the preventive efforts for very long,” said Dino, governor of the northern state of Maranhão.Azambuja, who has a two-year-old son, said she was perplexed at how some seemed incapable of thinking about others and obeying social distancing rules during a health emergency some fear could claim 125,000 Brazilian lives by August.“When I caught Covid-19, right at the start of the pandemic, my dad brought me some chicken soup and I told him to go away. I didn’t even want him at my door,” she remembered.“Every day I see this disease kill people,” she added. “The doctors in some hospitals don’t even have sedatives and painkillers. They intubate patients with muscle relaxants, aware of it all. That’s why these parties are so surreal.”Azambuja said she was determined to get back to work despite her injuries.“My leg’s still bad,” she admitted. “But I don’t need my leg to intubate patients.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f21e1c8b5b5ae718357c4b52acdba337def24b9/0_116_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb74ac6f49af35f3f28518ea37e02d7c","title":"coronavirus cases uptick detected some us states","story":"As cases states in the north-east drop, states across the south and California are seeing increases – much to experts’ concernAs the US enters the heat of summer and coronavirus restrictions start to wind down, public health experts are already noticing a concerning trend – an uptick in Covid-19 cases in parts of the country.A resurgence in new infections has been detected in states including Florida, Texas and California, as authorities restart normal rhythm of life by allowing certain businesses and public places to reopen.On Sunday, Florida recorded more than 1,000 newly-diagnosed Covid-19 cases for the fifth day of the previous week, with Thursday’s total of 1,413 the highest since the state started providing daily updates in March.In Texas, officials in Dallas said the city hit its highest ever one-day total for new infections on Thursday, at 285, while Houston has also recorded climbing numbers.Arizona, meanwhile, has seen one of the largest jumps in the country, with the daily total in new cases breaking the state record on four separate occasions over the past week.Doug Ducey, the Arizona governor, who relaxed restrictions two weeks ago, has put the increase down to an increase in testing and insisted that his approach on reopening has been prudent.The overall number of new cases recorded each day across the US is hovering around 20,000, down from a peak of 30,000 in April, but this decrease is mainly due to the improving situation in the worst-hit states, such as New York and New Jersey.As states in the north-east experience drops in new cases, states across the south and California are seeing increases even as they loosen social distancing rules designed to prevent person-to-person transmission of the virus.Donald Trump has mostly vacated pandemic response to inidual states and has not addressed the crisis in a major way even as the death rate passed 100,000 Americans.Given the lag in incubation times of the virus, it appears the rise in cases has occurred around the time states started to lift restrictions, leading to scenes in the weekend leading up and including the 25 May Memorial Day holiday, where people flocked to beaches and lakes and in many cases did not practice social distancing.Epidemiologists have warned the onward march of reopening will make it difficult to keep a lid on infections if an American public weary of lockdown is again asked to isolate themselves.“The worrisome thing for me is that there’s a lot of fatigue in the population overall,” said Wafaa El-Sadr, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University.“People feel they have done distancing and they are thirsting to get outside and connect with each other. If this surge requires us taking a step back, how do we convince people to do that? I feel we’ve made five steps forward and now maybe one step back.”The uptick is likely to be exacerbated by the large protest gatherings across the US in recent weeks over the death of George Floyd at the hands of police.While the protests have largely been outdoors, less risky than indoor gatherings, the act of shouting and chanting can spread droplets containing the virus. Pepper spray and teargas fired by police can induce coughing in protesters, which can also spread the disease.It’s unclear how strong the latest outbreak will be, although experts point out most states have helped encourage new social distancing or mask-wearing behaviours, as well as shielding the most vulnerable people.Testing rates have also ramped up over the past month, although states still lack a comprehensive system to track, trace and isolate those who have come into contact with an infected person.“All the modeling has shown if you reopen without extensive testing and contract tracing, you’ll see an increase in the epidemic,” said Ira Longini, professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida. “That activity is not happening in an organized way in Florida, it’s haphazard. That points towards an increase over summer and then a potentially much bigger increase in the fall.”“I’m worried the crisis will run on and on, unless a miracle happens. That said, there is a saying that if you’ve seen one flu epidemic, you’ve seen one flu epidemic. There’s a lot of unpredictability.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50d4a43b6fafd1468fc54fd946016d4b8167c002/0_31_3053_1833/master/3053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7e669c6ec9d700fcc3bf0d917078ece","title":"coronavirus may have been in wuhan in august study suggests","story":"Research finds rise in hospital car park usage and web searches for ‘diarrhoea’ and ‘cough’Coronavirus may have been present and spreading in Wuhan as early as August last year, according to a study that analysed satellite imagery of car parks outside major hospitals and search engine data.The study, by researchers from Harvard Medical School, Boston University of Public Health and Boston children’s hospital, looked at images captured between January 2018 and April 2020 and found a “steep increase” in vehicle counts starting in August 2019 and peaking in December 2019. Between September and October, five of the six hospitals observed had their highest daily volume of cars in the period analysed.China’s foreign ministry rejected the study, calling it “extremely absurd”.According to the study, the increase in vehicle volume coincided with a rise in queries on the Chinese search engine Baidu for “cough” and “diarrhoea”, about three weeks before the confirmed rise in coronavirus cases in early 2020. The researchers noted that while queries for cough coincided with the influenza season, diarrhoea is a symptom specific to Covid-19.“Increased hospital traffic and symptom search data in Wuhan preceded the documented start of the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic in December 2019,” the researchers said in a preprint, published by Harvard’s DASH repository.“In August, we identify a unique increase in searches for diarrhoea which was neither seen in previous flu seasons or mirrored in the cough search data,” it said.China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Tuesday in a regular press briefing that she had not seen the study but she rejected its conclusions.“I think it is absurd, actually extremely absurd, to draw this kind of conclusion based on superficial observations such as traffic volume,” she said.The origins of Covid-19, which was first detected in a cluster of cases associated with the Huanan seafood market in late December, has become an increasingly sensitive question as China fights off accusations that it should be blamed for the pandemic, which has killed more than 400,000 people around the world.The authors of the study, which is still under peer review, acknowledged that they could not confirm whether the increased vehicle volume was directly related to the new virus. Wuhan would have been entering influenza season several doctors said that in December some schools had cancelled classes because of the flu.Other limitations include the presence of tall buildings, trees and smog, which limited the number of high-resolution images that could be taken. There was also limited archival footage of Wuhan in previous years because of a “lack of commercial interest”.The study said: “Our evidence supports other recent work showing that emergence happened before identification at the Huanan seafood market. These findings also corroborate the hypothesis that the virus emerged naturally in southern China and was potentially already circulating at the time of the Wuhan cluster.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a82f154b4fcde702f8573d822fa054265c0fe270/106_0_1582_950/master/1582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e419e214b875bfc3781ba1abc241088b","title":"it is about our survival uaes mars mission prepares for launch","story":"Arab world’s first interplanetary mission will see probe orbit planet for a Martian year to study its climateThe Arab world’s first interplanetary mission, due to launch in 40 days’ time and reach\u0026nbspthe orbit of\u0026nbspMars\u0026nbspin February\u0026nbspnext year, is about the survival and future of the entire Middle East, the\u0026nbspleaders of the United Arab Emirates project\u0026nbsphave declared.\u0026nbspThe mission\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspalso\u0026nbspthe latest sign that the old cartel of space exploration, once confined to the superpowers, is being\u0026nbspbroken up by new\u0026nbspnational entrants\u0026nbspor private sector\u0026nbspfirms.The “Hope\u0026nbspMars\u0026nbspmission”,\u0026nbspdue to be launched on\u0026nbsp15 July, has been\u0026nbspin preparation by the United Arab Emirates\u0026nbspsince 2014,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspaccording to the project manager, Omran Sharaf, is seen as integral to the country’s long-term economic development. “It is about the future of the UAE and our survival,” Sharaf said.The mission’s\u0026nbspobjective is not to land on Mars, but\u0026nbspto\u0026nbsporbit\u0026nbspthe planet to\u0026nbspstudy the dynamics of its atmosphere over an entire\u0026nbspMartian\u0026nbspyear\u0026nbspand form a\u0026nbspmore\u0026nbspcomplete picture of its climate.\u0026nbspOne aim is\u0026nbspto find out\u0026nbspmore about\u0026nbspwhat\u0026nbspled to\u0026nbspthe planet’s atmospheric\u0026nbsploss, including the\u0026nbspdisappearance of hydrogen and oxygen\u0026nbspon the surface.\u0026nbsp“We are studying a planet that looks as if it was very similar to our own, but has undergone some form of change\u0026nbspto the point it can no longer have\u0026nbspwater, one of\u0026nbspthe major building blocks of life,” the deputy project manager and minister for\u0026nbspadvanced sciences, Sarah al-Amiri, said.\u0026nbsp“For instance, if there is a major dust storm on Mars does that increase the\u0026nbsprates of escape\u0026nbspof hydrogen and oxygen?”\u0026nbspData will be distributed to 200 research institutes and\u0026nbspbe complementary\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspthe work of\u0026nbspother missions, including Nasa’s, the UAE insists.All in all it will be a busy summer for Mars space missions.

The London mayor is also pressing the politan police, the UK’s largest force, over the use of stop and search, stun guns and other practices amid concerns\u0026nbspabout the spread of coronavirus\u0026nbspin crowds, and fears of violence as it emerged that far-right groups were planning counter-demonstrations.The global Black Lives Matter protests were sparked by the death in the US of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer who held him with a knee on his neck for nine minutes while he protested: “I can’t breathe.”The UK government has come under fire for its claim that the spreading protests are related to the US rather than prejudice in the UK and denials that Britain is a racist country.Boris Johnson said on Monday that Floyd’s death had awakened an “incontrovertible, undeniable feeling of injustice” worldwide.\u0026nbsp He had previously condemned the “thuggery” by a minority that marred some demonstrations but acknowledged many of the activists’ concerns were “founded on a cold reality”.\u0026nbspHe said leaders “simply can’t ignore” concerns that black, Asian and minority ethnic groups face discrimination in education, employment and the criminal justice system.\u0026nbspHowever, the prime minister said those who harmed police or property would face “the full force of the law”.\u0026nbspKeir Starmer, the Labour leader, has\u0026nbspsaid it was “completely wrong”\u0026nbspfor protesters to pull down the statue of Colston and dump it in the harbour in Bristol – putting him at odds with some MPs on the left of his party – while emphasising the monument should never have been there in the first place.After police stood by and watched the statue being toppled in Bristol, the focus will shift on Tuesday to Oxford, where hundreds of students and residents are expected to attend a protest calling for the removal of Oxford University’s\u0026nbspstatue of\u0026nbspthe colonialist Cecil Rhodes.A symbolic and socially distanced commemoration is planned at the Nelson Mandela statue in Parliament Square in London at 5pm, organised by Stand Up To Racism.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f4281931b3457fb0f28fe4595d334a5ec1892a6/0_8_5585_3351/master/5585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc9a91838b2c29885025db070e690744","title":"uk coronavirus live covid 19 latest updates","story":"Latest news: union says most teachers concerned about safety Tory MP says not sending all primary school children back risks life chancesIn response to questions from MPs, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, has repeatedly said that his department will be taking action to help compensate pupils for the lack of education that they have had this summer. He has not given many details, but he has stressed that this it will take a long time – more than a year – to repair the damage done.This is what he said to the Conservative MP Robert Halfon on this topic.We do need a long-term plan. That is what we are doing. We recognise that the learning loss is not something that is going to be corrected over a few weeks, but this is action that needs to be taken over a long period of time, and that is the approach we are taking.This is what Williamson said to Labour’s Meg Hillier.And in terms of catch-up, this isn’t about something that is just over a few weeks. This has got to be an approach over a full year and more. That is what we are putting in place. That is how we are going to be supporting children into the long term.And this is what he said to the Conservative MP Tim Loughton, who (like Halfon) asked about the possibility of running catch-up schemes over the summer holidays. Williamson said:This is certainly what we are looking at but we are looking at something much more wide and much more long-term because we don’t believe that actually just purely looking at the summer period is enough in order to be able to assist children to get the catch-up that they truly need.Independent Sage has been posting some highlights from the press conference it held at lunchtime to publicise its report criticising the test and trace system on Twitter. (See 11.25am.) Here’s one of their tweets.At her daily briefing Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said that she “deeply regretted” that restrictions on people who are shielding will not be eased until the end of July, but insisted that the current guidance is constantly being monitored and that some changes will be made in some cases by July 18, to let people leave their homes for exercise.Regarding pleas from the Scottish tourist industry to reduce the 2 metre rule, she said that she had not seen any evidence either coming to the Scottish or UK government to suggest that this distance should be reduced.Asked whether, under the new track and trace system, it would be made public if someone who had attended one of the Black Lives Matter protests had subsequently tested positive for coronavirus, interim chief medical officer Gregor Smith said that in such a scenario an incident team would be set up which would assess whether this was necessary.Sturgeon also announced that she was establishing an expert reference group on the impact of the virus on minority ethnic communities in Scotland. The Trades Union Council (TUC) is calling for an urgent rescue package for the childcare sector similar to that put in place in Germany and an extension to the furlough scheme for parents who can’t access childcare. The TUC says more than 700 new mothers have replied to a survey saying they cannot return to work because of a lack of childcare, with lower income parents harder hit because they cannot call on grandparents to help. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said many working mothers currently on maternity leave faced being stranded without childcare or financial support. “That is not right,” she said. She went on:Ministers must extend the cut off for the furlough scheme for mums who cannot find childcare. And they must ensure that a proper rescue plan is put in place for the childcare sector. If they don’t, thousands of women will be locked out of the jobs market.Robert Halfon, the Conservative chair of the education committee, asks why it is so hard to reopen schools. What is being done to avoid a decade of educational poverty? And what will be done to ensure pupils get free school meals over the summer.Williamson says 100,000 laptops have already been distributed to the most vulnerable pupils. A further 75,000 pupils are being distributed to schools in the next few weeks.But he says Halfon is right to say a long-term plan is needed to address the “learning loss”.Williamson is responding to Long-Bailey.He says they both want what is best for pupils.But pupils need to go back, he says. If it were up to Long-Bailey, she would not bring pupils back until that was agreed by the National Education Union, he says.He says he will work with local authorities. Where they have concerns about opening schools, the government will ensure they get the best advice, he says.If the government subsequently has to close schools in small clusters, it will follow that advice, he says.Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, says she is glad the government has followed Labour’s advice and abandoned plans to get all primary school pupils back before the summer holidays.But she is dismayed by how this has been handled, she says.And she says she is concerned about the damage being done to children by miissed education.The government should be setting up summer schools to help pupils catch up, she says.And she calls for a national plan for education.She says Williamson has met with the relevant groups. But that is not the same as involving them in a national plan.She says all pupils should get a one-on-one meeting with a teacher before the summer.And she says the decision not to run the free school meal voucher scheme over the summer is “deeply callous”.Williamson says the government has published detailed guidance on the protective measures schools need to take.The safety of young people and staff is his top priority, he says. They will qualify for testing.The government continues to follow “the best scientific advice”, he says.And says, although all primary children cannot return before the summer, the government will work with schools on what happens next. He goes on:We will be working to bring all children back to school in September.He also says exams will take place next year.Williamson says it is not more than two and a half months since schools were closed for most pupils.He says it is vital pupils get back to school as soon as possible. And he says he was very pleased some pupils were able to go back in England last week.Last week we saw the number of primaries taking nursery, reception and year one or year six pupils steadily rise as part of a phased, cautious, wider reopening of schools.He says he knows some schools are worried that the local reproduction number, R, is above 1. But nationally it is below 1, he says. And if there are local problems, the government will address them, he says.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, is about to make his statement to MPs confirming that not all primary school pupils will be able to return to the classroom before the end of summer.And here is a fuller quote from the Department for Education statistical bulletin (pdf) out today saying that only around half of primary schools in England re-opened last week in accordance with government plans for pupils in reception, year 1 and year 6 to go back to class. (See 10.32am.)From 1 June, the government asked schools to welcome back children in nursery, reception and years 1 and 6, alongside children of critical workers and vulnerable children.From the Times’ George GryllsThe DfE statistical bulletin is here (pdf)."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274477.1591703350!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"blue flag beaches 2020 ballybunion north beach loses status","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBallybunnion beach in Co Kerry has lost its Blug Flag status for 2020. Photograph: Getty Ballybunion North beach in Co Kerry has failed to retain its blue flag status in 2020 due to a deteroiation in its water quality.Beaches are required to have excellent water quality to qualify for the flag, but the rating for Ballybunnion deteriorated slightly to ‘good’ based on the analysis of in-season water quality samples taken between 2016 and 2019, a report published on Tuesday found. In all, there were 90 Blue Flags and 60 Green Coast Awards awarded this year by An Taisce. The Blue Flag programme aims to raise environmental awareness and promote sound environmental management of beaches, marinas and inland bathing waters around the world, while the Green Coast Award recognises beaches for their clean environment, water quality and natural beauty.Two beaches were initially awarded a Blue Flag but will not be flying them this summer. Due to lower than normal beach sand levels, Wexford County Council has withdrawn the Blue Flag awarded to Courtown beach for the time being. And in Co Galway, as a result of restrictions in place to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, it was not possible to put a lifeguard service in place for Cill Mhuirbhigh, on Inis Mór for the bathing season.“The National Blue Flag jury felt it was very unfortunate that Cill Mhuirbighcould not fly the Blue Flag that had been awarded to the site at this time,as a result of the unprecedented circumstances we find ourselves in.” The 80 Irish beaches and 10 marinas awarded a blue flag for this year must adhere tospecific criteria on water quality, information, environmental education, safety and site management.Two beaches Baginbunin in Co Wexford and Carrigahold in Co Clare, were awarded the Green Coast Award in 2020 for the first time.Mornington beach in County Meath regained its Green Coast Award status having last held the award in 2017.Meanwhile, four sites awarded Green Coast status last year did not retain this for 2020.Arklow beach in Co Wicklow did not meet the required water quality to obtain Green Coast Award status this year, while in-season water quality testing at Dumhach Beach and East End Bay, both on Inisbofin, could not be carried out as a result of restrictions relating to Covid-19.Trá Inis Oirrcould not be awarded the statusdue to the absence of an in-season lifeguard service.However, the jury added that in light of the potential for changes to restrictions currently in place, if all criteria could be met at a later point in the summer, it may be possible to award these sites during the 2020 season.Five beaches achieved dual award status, including Portmarnock in Fingal, Salthill and Silver Strand in Co Galway, Rosses Point in Co Sligo and Ballinskelligs in Kerry. These sites have fulfilled all Blue Flag criteria relating to water quality, facilities for visitors, beach management, environmental education and the provision of information, while also fulfilling the Green Coast Award requirement of community involvement in the management of the site, the judges said.Announcing the awards, Ian Diamond, Coastal Awards Manager with An Taisce’s Environmental Education Unit, said it is important to bear in mind the “additional pressure” being put on local authorities to manage beaches during the Covid-19 pandemic.“ With unprecedented numbers forced to stay at home for the past few months from work and school we must be cognisant ofthe challenges facing those managing our beaches,” Mr Diamond said.“ In the same manner as we have all worked together against Covid-19 we must all exercise personal responsibility to enjoy our beaches in a safe and sustainable way.”Full list of Blue Flag beaches for 2020Louth County Council ShellinghillTempletown - Beach"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Such plants are 35 times more efficient at capturing and storing carbon than tropical forestsFaster cuts in methane and nitrous oxide from farming needed \u0026ndash Stop Climate ChaosOn-farm measures are key to reducing emissions - environmental watchdog"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteria"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Eliminating Covid-19 through tougher short-term measures represents the “most scientifically sound” strategy for Ireland, according to more than 1,000 Irish researchers.In an open letter published on Monday, the group of scientists and academics say Ireland has “come to a watershed moment . . . the path we choose will determine our future for years to come”.They acknowledge the huge impact already on the economy but suggest measures now be deployed to “crush” the virus on an all-island basis, as many other countries have done. This, they add, is possible over a number of weeks not months.Signatories include public health specialists infectious disease experts, virologists, immunologists, and doctors including respiratory and intensive care consultants working in acute hospitals – many of whom worked on the frontline during the height of the pandemic.“Our current policy is to live with the virus under a long-term mitigation strategy, with the risk of future surges and lockdowns until when, or if, a vaccine becomes available. We have another option: we can do as many other countries have done, choose to suppress and eliminate this virus – ‘crushing the curve’,” they suggest.‘Normal’Because of a timely response the island of Ireland managed to bring the epidemic under control, they point out.“A range of emergency restrictions imposed by the two Governments, following scientific advice, stopped our healthcare systems being overwhelmed and saved many lives. The public support these restrictions, and report that they clearly understood the need for them.”All this had come at a huge cost, they note, with enormous sums of money spent many losing jobs and businesses wondering if they will be able to open again.People will once again feel confident in using public transport, returning to school, going out to eat and to shop, pressure on the healthcare system will be relieved, and trust in our economy will be restored, they accept.“For the economies on our island, this would be enormously valuable. Vulnerable people will be effectively protected.”There was, however, a push to get back to “normal” as fast as possible. “What does ‘normal’ look like if the virus continues to circulate? Right now, public transport is planning for 20 per cent of ‘normal’ capacity, pubs and restaurants 30 per cent, schools, at best only 50 per cent.“The costs of childcare, already high, will be impossible for many. Many workplaces will need expensive re-design. Many people will drop out, or be pushed out of the labour force. All of these are real costs, and will, we believe, far exceed the short-term costs of lockdown.”“For these reasons we strongly encourage the Governments to take resolute actions to suppress this pandemic at once. Eliminating the virus represents the most scientifically sound strategy in terms of public health and economics alike.”“Several countries have already largely halted the virus, including South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Austria, Greece, China and Iceland, by continuing public health measures, including the use of masks, active fast contact tracing and testing, and sensible restrictions on travel.”Such measures were planned for both parts of this island, “but they must be enhanced and coordinated – with the aim of achieving ambitious suppression targets”.This should be on the basis of first achieving suppression and elimination of Covid-19, “and then we must maintain it”.Realistic exit strategyThese countries achieved suppression, and some have demonstrated they can also maintain it in the face of new cases, as seen in South Korea. “Each country has developed its own solutions, to fit its own needs, and we can do the same on our joint island,” the scientists underline.“All our sacrifices over the last two months have driven down the number of cases, and given us a precious window of opportunity that we must not squander. This is a decisive moment in the history of our island.”The goal should be to suppress the number of new cases to zero as soon as possible, and to keep them there. Given political leadership, an agreed and scientifically sound strategy, and cooperation from citizens, “this can be done, and done in weeks, not in months”.“When we reach this goal, new infections have to be closely monitored for the foreseeable future under a robust, rapid, and vigilant testtraceisolate infrastructure.”Alternatively, if the country decides to live with the virus, they believe, “extensive, and expensive, restrictions will continue for the foreseeable future. A vaccine will take at least two years, and there is no established treatment”.Societies that have suppressed and eliminated this pandemic will enjoy considerably greater freedoms and prosperity than those where the virus persists, the signatories predict. Travel, tourism, and trade with other successful countries would be straightforward and beneficial.Given Ireland’s geography, population size and social cohesion, suppression was a realistic exit strategy “a genuine way out of our current economic and social standstill”.Lead signatories are epidemiologist Prof Anthony Staines of DCU infectious diseases ecologist Prof Gerard Killeen of UCC and immunologist Dr Tomás Ryan of TCD.The letter and signatories are available at http:crushthecurve.ieEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4273963.1591691269!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 testing could cost state 450m by year end says hse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople walk past reopened shops and businesses on O’Connell Street, Dublin, on Monday as  lockdown measures are eased. Photograph: Paul FaithAFP via Getty ImagesA Covid-19 testing system producing 15,000 results every day could cost the State €450 million by the end of the year, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has said. In correspondence sent to the special Oireachtas committee on the Covid-19 response, which sits again on Tuesday, the HSE said that running 15,000 tests “per day every day” would entail projected costs “in the region of €450 million”. Currently, the HSE has capacity to test about that number on a given day, but demand for testing is significantly lower, with recent data showing fewer than 5,000 community and hospital lab tests being carried out per day.A HSE spokeswoman confirmed the sum would be for producing 15,000 tests a day every day until the end of 2020. According to the document, the HSE believes that level of testing will “clearly will not be a requirement”, but warns that the current testing system needs a significant overhaul to be fit for purpose in the medium term. A spokeswoman said that current “temporary solutions are not sustainable for the longer term”.The HSE has previously announced that it will complete a strategic plan for testing and tracing by the autumn. The briefing document emphasises that the current testing and tracing model “is not sustainable in the long term”, due to its reliance on staff and equipment which have been temporarily reassigned from elsewhere, as well as the use of community centres and sports grounds such as Croke Park as sampling centres, and reliance on short-term laboratory provider contracts. It says a longer-term testing and tracing strategy will include its own financial plan.Testing equipmentSo far, the HSE has spent almost €80 million on testing and tracing, the document shows, including €33 million procuring testing equipment. Some €23 million has been spent on laboratory testing, and €14.5 million has been paid to general practitioners. The document shows that €371,000 has so far been spent on the HSE’s delayed Covid-19 tracing app. The costs of private labs are not yet included as contracts and payments schedules are being finalised. It also emerged that the State’s health watchdog warned the Department of Health in early April that 124 public and private nursing homes – a fifth of the country’s care homes - were “at risk” and could need additional support from the HSE to address outbreaks of Covid-19.Documents released to the Oireachtas committee show the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) told the department on April 9th “the lack of a direct relationship” between the HSE and private nursing homes would make it difficult to project the homes’ specific needs.Risk assessmentHiqa’s chief inspector Mary Dunnion told the department in a risk assessment that in a large number of private homes the “skills mix and competencies” of staff fell short of what was required to deal with the “escalating care needs of residents during a Covid-19 outbreak”.Meanwhile, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) confirmed another four deaths of people with Covid-19 in the State, the lowest daily number to be confirmed since March 11th. This brought the total number of deaths associated with the disease to 1,683. Another nine cases of Covid-19 were diagnosed, bringing the total to 25,207. While the number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations has fallen, the average number of close contacts reported by those infected with the disease jumped to more than five.Speaking at the NPHET briefing, the State’s chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, has said Irish people “can do better” when it comes to the wearing of face masks in public as part of an effort to suppress the spread of coronavirus.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Philip Murphy was extradited from England over alleged attacks in city in February 2016Open self-service breakfast buffets are likely to become a thing of the pastDublin City Council is to open play areas after they have passed a safety inspectionManagement of second wave will be different from first, chair of epidemiology group saysBookings will be encouraged and a time period allocated to spend in the restaurantSunday Mass obligation remains dispensed with under new Catholic church guidelinesSupreme Court finds legislation only covers \u0026lsquoa biologicaladoptive child\u0026rsquoBaginbunin in Wexford and Carrigahold in Clare are awarded first Green Coast awardsShower \u0026lsquoschedules\u0026rsquo and employee shopping for customers may be introducedTour sizes set to be cut, with participants bringing as much personal equipment as possibleKits at reception will have germicidal wipes, face and eye masks, gloves, protective aprons and biohazard disposable waste bagsDo you know what terms such as \u0027asynchronous learning\u0027 or \u0027blended learning\u0027 mean?Agreement unlikely without interventions from the three party leaders of Fianna F\u0026aacuteil, Fine Gael and the GreensStaffing levels and nursing skills \u0026lsquonot commensurate\u0026rsquo with Covid-19 care needsHealth experts warn of increase in suicide and self-harm due to coronavirusBusiness at CAB Motor Company in Cork has been brisk, but work practices have changedFormer taoiseach breaks political silence to help bereavement counselling helplineStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274428.1591708422!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus advice on face masks for ireland s over 60s to be reviewed this week committee hears","story":"The strategy laid out by Government is the right strategy to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, the chair of the Irish Epidemiology Modelling Advisory Group has told the special Oireachtas committee on the virus.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Cillian de Gascun said there was inequity for some people who could not afford to buy their own mask. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsGuidance that people over 60 should wear a face mask “seems like a practical approach” but it depends on the setting, the Covid-19 Oireachtas committee has been told.Director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory Dr Cillian de Gascun said the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) would review the advice issued this week by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that everyone over 60 should wear a face mask.Dr de Gascun said “we recommend them for people who are asymptomatic and for those who cannot maintain adequate physical distance at the moment such as on public transport”.He said earlier there was always a reluctance to make it mandatory for people to wear a mask but he acknowledged that the uptake was not as large as they thought for people to follow the recommendation in such situations.He said there is time to “scale up manufacturing capacity” to supply face coverings to households if there is a resurgence of coronavirus.Dr de Gascun said there was inequity for some people who could not afford to buy their own mask and acknowledged that it could be a good idea to supply masks, while maintaining supplies of medical grade masks for healthcare workers in clinical settings.Dr de Gascun pointed out, however, that the evidence for the wearing of cloth masks or non-medical grade masks “is not fantastic, to be honest. There’s a nice plausible hypothesis that people use that it stops the particles, that it’s trapping the virus as well. We don’t actually have great evidence in that area.”Labour TD Duncan Smith called for the Government to supply re-usable masks to every household in the country in light of the lifting of restrictions.Chair of the Irish Epidemiology Modelling Advisory Group Prof Philip Nolan warned however that there was a view that “if only we had testing and tracing and a face mask we could do all the other things we used to do”.He said that the best way to suppress the virus was to adhere to the public health guidance including maintaining social distancing.Government strategy The strategy laid out by Government is the right strategy to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, Prof Nolan told the committee earlier on Tuesday morning.Prof Nolan said that “different scientists have different judgments in the face of incomplete evidence”when asked about the open letter by 1,000 Irish researchers calling for a policy rethink to crush Covid-19.He said the strategy is not one of mitigation or living with an ongoing or significant levels of transmission, but of suppression.The letter by leading scientists and epidemiologists called for stronger short-term measures to eliminate the virus.Prof Nolan said, however, that he fully supported the recommendations of the NPHET. “I support them and they accord with my judgment. No strategy utterly insulates us from the virus.”He told Fianna Fáil health spokesman Stephen Donnelly that there will be renewed outbreaks of Covid-19 disease across Europe which would be in “small waves.”Prof Nolan told the committee that “the management of the second wave will be different from the first wave. There could be more targeted measures introduced to control future outbreak.”Asked by Mr Donnelly if Irish society will be fully functioning by the end of the year, Prof Nolan said, “I don’t have a crystal ball on this and could not give a probability on the likelihood”.“Our behaviour will continue to be modified by this virus for some time to come.”He said that when people talk about a second wave it “gives the impression that some overwhelming second wave will wash over” society.“It is probable that at some point in the future an incidence of the virus will increase again,” he said. There would be new outbreaks and public health care would be required to intervene and control.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274579.1591707925!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin city playgrounds are set to reopen today","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin city playgrounds are set to reopen today. File photograph: Nick BradshawThe All Dublin city playgrounds are set to reopen on Tuesday once they have passed a safety inspection, Dublin City Council has said. The decision to reopen all of the city playgrounds, albeit without council supervision or a cleansing regime, was discussed at a meeting of Dublin city councillors on Monday evening. Playgrounds elsewhere around the country started reopening on Monday after being closed for nearly three months amid the Covid-19 pandemic. In a statement, the council said a decision had been made to reopen playgrounds on Tuesday following clarification on the roadmap for phase two of the Government’s plan for reopening society following the coronavirus lockdown. The reopen would be subject to playgrounds passing an inspection, it noted. Dublin City Council chief executive Owen Keegan had previously said on Monday that Dublin’s playgrounds would be reopened this week on a “pre-Covid-19 basis”, meaning “they will not be supervised and cleansing will not be in place”. Last Friday the council had said its playgrounds, which have been fenced off since the middle of March under the coronavirus restrictions, would remain shut, despite assurances from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that the facilities could open from Monday.Mr Varadkar had confirmed that “outdoor facilities and amenities for children” could reopen under phase two of the Government’s accelerated roadmap for easing Covid-19 restrictions. This would include the reopening of playgrounds as long as they are supervised, he said.However, Dublin City Council had said in response that it “does not operate supervised playgrounds” and so would not be reopening these facilities. The council operates about 100 playgrounds, almost 70 of which are in public parks, with the remainder located in the grounds of social housing complexes.Parental supervisionDún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal county councils both confirmed on Monday that their playgrounds would reopen over the coming days following safety inspections of all equipment.Fingal said it was working on a plan to allow for the “phased reopening of playgrounds” and that parents and s would be expected to supervise their children while in the playground, in line with existing physical distancing and hygiene guidelines.A Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown spokesman said all of the council’s playgrounds were expected to reopen by the middle of this week and new signage outlining guidelines would be put in place.As in Fingal, parents and s using parks in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown will be expected to supervise their children, said the spokesman.A spokeswoman for the Local Government Management Agency said all local authorities would open playgrounds this week subject to “necessary preparatory work”, including the provision of appropriate signage.Waterford City and County Council has said it will not reopen playgrounds until it receives clarification on the issue of supervision in play areas. Wicklow County Council, Laois County Council and Galway City Council said they planned to reopen playgrounds this week on a phased basis.

We can’t keep it all to ourselves.” Photograph: Patrick BrowneDunmore East is beginning to wake up after the longest winter in anyone’s memory. With the countywide travel restrictions lifted, parking is suddenly at a premium again in the Co Waterford seaside village. And for once, nobody is complaining about it.A small, socially distant lunchtime crowd has gathered in the sun outside the Lemon Tree restaurant. The restaurant switched to takeaway only in March, and stayed open throughout the lockdown, serving a full daytime menu through a newly installed hatch. It’s been such a success that owner Joan Boland hasn’t yet decided whether to reopen the dining room. Like most people here, she is glad to see life coming back to the village. “There are cars everywhere. It’s a nice feeling.”Gillian Westman is giving the lampposts outside the Haven Hotel a fresh coat of paint. “I’m doing them in sixes,” she says. A member of the Tidy Towns committee, her pleasure at seeing signs of summer is tinged with nervousness. At 132.6 cases per 100,000 people, Waterford has the lowest incidence of Covid-19 of anywhere in the country. “Our numbers have been right down all the way through. Everybody is a bit anxious” that might change when the full travel restrictions are lifted, Westman says.But, she adds, “it’s a beautiful place. We can’t keep it all to ourselves.”There is an awareness, too, that the local economy relies on those visitors. With a summertime population that swells from 2,000 to between 8,000 and 12,000, “tourism is the only game in town”, says restauranteur Adriano Cavaliere.‘Darth Vader’At the socially distant team meeting upstairs in Azzurro, he and his co-owner brother Dario give floor staff an idea of what to expect when the restaurant reopens on June 29th. “When customers come here for dinner, they don’t want to think about Covid,” Adriano says. So there won’t be large signage all over the restaurant beyond what is legally required.A staff member asks about masks and gloves. Masks will be provided to floor staff, Dario says. But, Adriano adds, “the thing to remember is it’s not mandatory. Let’s say you, as a punter, go into a restaurant and everybody is wearing masks and visors, and they all look like Darth Vader, you’re not going to feel comfortable. Hand hygiene is the number one way to stop the spread of Covid.” Staff will be required to complete a hygiene course before they come back to work, he says.Dario asks who would like to wear a mask. Nobody raises their hand.Back downstairs, Adriano has laid out tables 1.5 metres apart. The business won’t be viable if the two-metre rule isn’t relaxed, he says. “If it stays at two metres, I probably wouldn’t bother opening the doors. Normally, I’d have 16-18 people in this room. At two metres, I’m looking at six to eight. It’s just not practicable. You can’t do it.”The three months of summer account for nearly 60 per cent of the restaurant’s total business. “Right now, just with takeaway, I’m making enough money to pay the suppliers and keep the lights on,” Adriano says. He’d like to see the Government give a VAT holiday to help businesses like his survive.Hygiene and temperatureThe season is even shorter for Karen Harris, who owns the Dunmore East Adventure Centre. The centre’s aqua park, which should already be open for school tours and birthday parties, is closed until June 29th. The current regulations mean operating at half-capacity with increased hygiene measures and temperature checks, but Harris won’t increase prices. “As soon as we put out there that we were reopening, the bookings flew in. Everybody is mad to go,” she says.The Breakwater gift shop opened on Monday morning to a steady stream of customers, many of whom were buying multiple baby and birthday gifts. It’s a “bittersweet day”, says owner Emma Loftus, from behind her new perspex screen. She’s delighted to be back, but her second shop near the Greenway won’t be reopening. “It could have been a lot worse. I could have lost everything.” In the breaks between serving customers, she is philosophical. “You can’t run a business with your heart. It has to be with your head.”Outside the Strand Hotel, staff members are repainting the blue tables and benches ahead of the planned reopening on June 29th. It can’t come soon enough for owners Edwina Foyle and Louise Foyle-Fezer. “We’ve now had four sunny bank holidays, and we’ve missed out on all of them. The whole village has missed out,” says Foyle.Most people are connected to the tourism industry to some degree, adds Foyle. “We would employ 50 people here in summer and 20 in winter. We really are so dependent on the summer months.”Down by the beach, Angela Kearns is taking advantage of the easing of countywide travel restrictions. Having spent the lockdown in Dunmore, she and her daughter Arlene and their dog are heading for a hike up to Coumshingaun Lake in the Comeragh mountains. The peace has been nice, but “it’s good to see a bit of normality return to the village”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274392.1591706145!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new rules for holidays in ireland under covid 19 no buffets mini bars or close dancing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere will  be no family-style service of food at weddings, ie no shared vegetable and gravy dishes. Photograph: iStock  Guests on the dance floor at weddings will be told to keep 2 metres apart under new post Covid-19 lockdown rules which will also see the end of mini-bars and self-service buffets in hotels.Guests in spas should also be offered express “stress management” treatments instead of therapies that involve touch, while those using hotel pools may be asked to book time slots in advance.For golfers, the space between tee times will be increased to 15-minute intervals. The guidelines also state that caddie service offered to guests must be suspended unless physical distancing can be adhered to.Restaurateurs are being asked to verbally tell customers what is on the menu while there will be no more sharing plates. Embellishments on drinks such as decorative cocktail umbrellas will have to be “minimised.” Tableside cooking should also be suspended if social distancing guidelines cannot be maintained.For hotel weddings, canapés will have to be served inidually and there will no more shared bowls of vegetables, gravy while condiments such as salt and pepper will be on request.Below are the key changes for hotel weddings, spas, golf and restaurants. Further guidance for pubs intending to operate as restaurants is set to be published in the coming days. The new recommendations are predicated on the current physical distancing guidance of 2 metres but public health officials are examining potentially reducing this to 1metre for the hospitality industry.The plans have been criticised by those in the food and beverage sector with the chief executive of the Restaurants Association of Ireland Adrian Cummins saying under the current two metre guidelines around 90 per cent of restaurants will not be able to open on June 29th. If that was reduced to one metre Mr Cummins said that would enable 80 per cent of restaurants to open. On Monday Minister for Health Simon Harris said the National Public Health Emergency Team was re-examining the appropriateness of the two metre social distancing requirement for the hospitality sector. HotelsGuests will be asked to enter the property through doors that are automated or manually operated by an employee where possible. “Reception employees should encourage just one representative of each arriving group to approach the check-in desk while the others adhere to physical distancing measures.”If guests use bell service, “ask them to place their luggage on the ground. The bell service can then commence, after which the bell cart can be cleaned and disinfected.”The guidelines say that it will be the responsibility of supervisors and managers to ensure that guests do not congregate in groups.The guidelines add that buffets should be avoided.“Avoid buffet-style service, where possible. If it is required, maintain physical distancing by avoiding queuing systems and staggering guests’ access to the buffet. Employees must plate up and serve food.”Guidelines on rooms say extra pillows and blankets will be provided only if requested by a guest. Food delivered to the room should be set on a tray or trolley in the hallway and the “guest can then retrieve their own food and drinks.”Mini-bars will be replaced by room service. They “must have all loose product removed and the bar then be locked. Items can be made available upon request from room service.”After a guest has left, the guest linen must be removed in a tied bag. “When linen is removed from a bed and laundered, employees must wear the relevant protective items eg gloves and apron, when separating the linen.”Pens will be removed or replaced after each guest checks out.In bars and function rooms, the amount of seating and stools must be reduced and the capacity of outside smoking areas must be reviewed. Open bar snacks or finger food will be served to inidual guests and not shared by a table. Tableside cooking “must be suspended if physical distancing cannot be adhered to.”Jugs will no longer be available on counters according to the guidelines as those using the counter as a dining facility may not be from the same household.Hotel pools Viewing chairs and seating must be removed completely. The pool area must be pressure washed, cleaned and disinfected each night, the guidelines state. “A designated employee must ensure the maximum pool capacity is not exceeded. Alternatively, guests can book their preferred pool time.”Hotel golf Space between tee times will also be increased to 15-minute intervals. Only one player can travel in a cart unless accompanied by people who are part of the same household. The guidelines also state that guest caddie service offered to guests must be suspended unless physical distancing can be adhered to. Inidual scorecards and pencil sets should also be made be available to players.Hotel spa Instead of close contact treatments the guidelines suggest “alternative express treatments” such as “stress management and options that do not involve touch”. Ultraviolet treatment boxes must be installed to ensure that all grooming equipment has been properly sterilised. Where physical distancing cannot be reasonably practised, therapists must be “provided with appropriate personal protective equipment and safeguards such as screens, training and instruction. Above all, it must be emphasised that gloves are no substitute for good handwashing.”Hotel weddings Even the dance floor will be subjected to social distancing under the guidelines. They also recommend a private room for the drinks reception. Canapés must be in inidual portions. During the meal, salt and pepper shakers, butter dishes will be available only on request. There will also be “no family-style service of food, ie no shared vegetable and gravy dishes.” Wedding afters “must be served directly to each guest fully plated.” Social distancing will have to be maintained on the dance floor. There will be signage on tables and dance floors which must ask guests to respect physical distancing guidelines. Staff will be required to monitor and manage distancing.Restaurants Where food is served buffet-style, all items for guest use must be “inidually wrapped” or be a single serve item. “Common tongs or ladles must not be used and neither must common distribution containers from which guests help themselves.”Restaurants are advised to encourage bookings and give specific time slots for diners.When a group arrives at a restaurant to queue, only one member should be asked do so, the document states. “The others must adhere to physical distancing until the group can be seated.”“The amount of seating and stools must be reduced and guests must order from their seat wherever possible to reduce queues.”Straws must be inidually wrapped and the “embellishment” or decoration of glasses like cocktail umbrellas should be minimised.Fresh glasses will be used for every new drink and when pouring drinks employees must handle glasses by the stem or base.Verbal menus are also being encouraged. The guidelines state that menus must be single use or made of a material that can easily be cleaned. “Electronic menus, phone apps and menu boards are an alternative option. It may be possible to verbally recommend food and drinks to guests. If so, this should be done.”Sharing plates must be served in inidual portions from the kitchen. Self-service buffet and hotplates will have to be “shielded from guests” and only employees must plate up food.Buffet service “must only be provided where physical distancing and other public health advice can be followed. Maintain physical distancing by staggering service and placing 2metre markings on the floor to highlight distance if queuing is unavoidable.” But no self-serve food will be available.Bill tip trays, pens and all other reusable guest contact items “must be cleaned and disinfected after each use or used just once and disposed of.”Every restaurant should have “at least one lead worker representative charged with ensuring that Covid-19 measures are strictly adhered to in their workplace,” the documents state.Restaurants are being urged to implement phased shifts, schedule small teams and keep the same team combinations where possible to limit employee interaction. “This will assist should contact tracing be required.”Restaurant tables, seating and couches in public areas and other physical layouts will have to be arranged to ensure appropriate social distancing is adhered to. Employees will also be reminded to “stay at least 2metre away from guests and other employees whenever possible.”The guideline state that if restaurants cannot ensure that employees stay the recommended distance apart at all times “alternative protective measures must be put in place. For example, install physical barriers such as clear plastic sneeze guards between employees.”Hand sanitiser dispensers, touchless whenever possible, must be placed at all restaurant entrances, at employee entrances and at specific points within the public areas of the restaurant. All hand sanitisers must have a minimum alcohol content of 60 per cent.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Lam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearDecision marks a setback in relations amid efforts to persuade North to give up nuclear weapons programmeSouth Pacific nation of 5m declared it was coronavirus free on MondayHospitals feel the strain as lockdowns are eased despite fears of a spike in infectionsHolidaymaker said he stumbled into abandoned well after being chased by wild dogMan (60) dies some 500 miles north of Sydney after board-riders pull him to shoreLarge crowd gathers shortly after legislature outlaws insults to China\u0026rsquos national anthemTrump administration has presented China with \u0026lsquoopportunities\u0026rsquo on the world stageStorm made landfall further south than expected giving some respite to metropolis ravaged by coronavirusDeath at Wuhan\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquowhistleblower hospital\u0026rsquo prompts wave of anger at hospital authoritiesSchools in deprived areas reported girls using newspapers and rags in attempt to manage periodAnnual vigil to mark Tiananmen Square massacre cancelled but activists still plan to rallyOfficials and media say US criticism of Hong Kong policing illustrates double standardsExperts fear country\u0026rsquos caseload could reach 1m in several weeks if virus is not curbedBejing approved decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorismMove paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4272018.1591378999!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier insists pragmatic workarounds are possible for trade in the north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichel Barnier holds the Official Journal of the European Union C34 during a press conference on Friday in Brussels regarding the fourth round of Brexit negotiations. Photograph:  Daina Le Lardic PoolGetty ImagesBusinesses in Northern Ireland should be able to use workarounds and exemptions to make checks on goods on the Irish Sea border less onerous, chief European Union negotiator Michel Barnier has said.He was responding to an opinion column in The  in which contributor Newton Emerson expressed concerns that the EU was cynically taking a “maximalist” position on checks in order to use the North as a “bargaining chip”.Mr Barnier emphasised that the special arrangements for the North – under which it will apply EU customs rules so that checks take place in ports and airports there rather than on the land border with the Republic – had been jointly drawn up and agreed with the British government, and that there was room for pragmatism within them.“Regarding Mr Emerson’s concerns ... I would say that we can take into account those concerns within the framework as it’s currently written, because it’s written in a very precise way,” Mr Barnier told reporters after the latest round of EU-UK talks concluded.Imported“Simplified declarations can be used for large economic operators, supermarkets being one of them,” he said.For goods that are imported into the North from Britain or elsewhere outside the EU, exemptions on tariffs are possible if it can be proved that the produce will not enter the single market.“This is something we are discussing with the United Kingdom as we speak,” Mr Barnier said. “We’re ready to work with the UK further on all aspects of what the EU customs code can offer in order to facilitate trade and do everything we can do that end. But for that we need genuine commitment also from the UK side also on a number of technical issues which I have to say isn’t always forthcoming.”Special arrangementsA joint EU-UK committee is currently overseeing the implementation of the special arrangements for the North agreed as part of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.\u0026nbspOfficials have said that plans for additional infrastructure to enforce checks need to be agreed swiftly in order to be ready for when the new arrangements come into force at the end of the year.Mr Barnier insisted he was keen to find a compromise. “I’m not dogmatic. Sometimes there is a bit of spin amongst UK politicians saying I’m some kind of dogmatic person and representing a technocratic commission, but I’m a pragmatic man,” he said.“I’m sure if we don’t get bogged down in ideological debate with pragmatism we can pull this off.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"British-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4271818.1591367972!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk says sides need face to face talks to make progress","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t British Brexit negotiator David Frost: “Any such deal must of course accommodate the reality of the UK’s well-established position on the so-called ‘level playing field’, on fisheries, and the other difficult issues.” Photograph:  Kenzo TribouillardAFP via Getty ImagesBritain’s chief negotiator David Frost described progress in the Brexit talks as “limited”, adding that the two sides were close to the limits of what could be achieved without face-to-face talks.Speaking after the latest round of talks ended on Friday, he said the talks must intensify and accelerate but appeared to abandon Britain’s threat to leave the talks if the shape of a deal was not in sight by the end of June.“We need to conclude this negotiation in good time to enable people and businesses to have certainty about the trading terms that will follow the end of the transition period at the end of this year, and, if necessary, to allow ratification of any agreements reached,” he said.“For our part we are willing to work hard to see whether at least the outline of a balanced agreement, covering all issues, can be reached soon. Any such deal must of course accommodate the reality of the UK’s well-established position on the so-called ‘level playing field’, on fisheries, and the other difficult issues.”In its negotiating mandate last February, the British government said that if not enough progress was made in the talks by June it would “need to decide whether the UK’s attention should move away from negotiations and focus solely on continuing domestic preparations to exit the transition period in an orderly fashion”.A senior British negotiating official said on Friday that coronavirus had delayed progress and it was time for talks to move to a different format with a smaller group of negotiators. The official rejected Michel Barnier’s accusation that Britain was disregarding the political declaration Boris Johnson agreed with the EU last October alongside the withdrawal agreement.“We are committed to the political declaration. We see it, as it describes itself, as a document that sets out the parameters. It isn’t in itself a treaty,” the official said.The source said that Britain’s offer to accept tariffs on some products rather than agree to level playing field commitments on fair competition fell on “stony ground” in Brussels.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274506.1591700860!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"london mayor orders review of all statues for slavery links","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A worker cleans the Churchill statue in London’s Parliament Square, which had been spray-painted with the words “was a racist”. Photograph:  Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesAll statues in London will be examined with a view to removing those with links to slavery and plantation owners, mayor Sadiq Khan has said.The London mayor said the city’s landmarks – including street names, the names of public buildings and plaques – will be reviewed by a commission to ensure they reflect the capital’s ersity after Black Lives Matter protesters tore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol. Speaking to broadcasters on Tuesday, Mr Khan said he did not condone breaking the law and wanted there to be a proper process for the removal of any statues that do not reflect London’s values.He would not name which ones should come down, saying it would be a matter for the new commission, but said there were clearly statues commemorating slavers in the capital.His new Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm will also consider which legacies should be celebrated before making recommendations about new statues and which could be removed. “It is an uncomfortable truth that our nation and city owes a large part of its wealth to its role in the slave trade and while this is reflected in our public realm, the contribution of many of our communities to life in our capital has been wilfully ignored. This cannot continue . . .“The Black Lives Matter protests have rightly brought this to the public’s attention, but it’s important that we take the right steps to work together to bring change and ensure that we can all be proud of our public landscape.” The commission – which will be co-chaired by Debbie Weekes-Bernard, the deputy mayor for social integration, social mobility and community engagement, and the deputy mayor for culture and creative industries, Justine Simons – will include historians as well as arts, council and community leaders. ‘Warts and all’Pressed on Sky News about where to draw the line, given Winston Churchill held some racist views, Mr Khan said the cases of Churchill, Gandhi and Malcolm X showed that many great historical figures were not perfect and history should be taught “warts and all”. But there were clear-cut figures such as those actively involved in the slave trade and ownership who should not be celebrated, the mayor said.Mr Khan announced the commission as he attempted to defuse tensions in London ahead of more planned anti-racism demonstrations. The London mayor is also pressing the politan police, the UK’s largest force, over the use of stop and search, stun guns and other practices amid concerns about the spread of coronavirus in crowds, and fears of violence as it emerged that far-right groups were planning counter-demonstrations.The global Black Lives Matter protests were sparked by the death in the US of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer who held him with a knee on his neck for nine minutes while he protested: “I can’t breathe.”The UK government has come under fire for its claim that the spreading protests are related to the US rather than prejudice in the UK and denials that Britain is a racist country.Boris Johnson said on Monday that Mr Floyd’s death had awakened an “incontrovertible, undeniable feeling of injustice” worldwide. He had previously condemned the “thuggery” by a minority that marred some demonstrations but acknowledged many of the activists’ concerns were “founded on a cold reality”. He said leaders “simply can’t ignore” concerns that black, Asian and minority ethnic groups face discrimination in education, employment and the criminal justice system. However, the prime minister said those who harmed police or property would face “the full force of the law”. Colston statueKeir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said it was “completely wrong” for protesters to pull down the statue of Colston and dump it in the harbour in Bristol – putting him at odds with some MPs on the left of his party – while emphasising the monument should never have been there in the first place.After police stood by and watched the statue being toppled in Bristol, the focus will shift on Tuesday to Oxford, where hundreds of students and residents are expected to attend a protest calling for the removal of Oxford University’s statue of the colonialist Cecil Rhodes. A symbolic and socially distanced commemoration is planned at the Nelson Mandela statue in Parliament Square in London at 5pm, organised by Stand Up To Racism. – Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"navel gazing identity politics wont help black youth","story":"My engagement with black British politics started in the 1980s – the era of Margaret Thatcher in power and apartheid South Africa oppressing black people. Back then in Britain we were fighting against the notorious “sus laws” which were used by the police to stop and search black people as a form of targeted harassment, and campaigning for Britain’s first generation of black MPs, the likes of Diane Abbott, Bernie Grant and Paul Boateng. One of the key differences with today is that we had a series of charismatic leaders who knew what they wanted to achieve.In my teenage years, events like the Brixton Riots were driven by lived experience. They were a response to the brutal racism we and our families and friends had all experienced. The Black Lives Matter protests, by contrast, seem to have been motivated largely by Instagram. Yes, they were inspired by the alleged murder of George Floyd in America. But social media, with its stark images, and the simple rhetoric of a world ided into white and black, along with celebrities and musicians urging protest, have made this a tech-driven revolt.Despite their righteous solidarity with suffering in America, Britain’s BLM protesters have little context for their anger. They have not been suffering through years of brutal racism. Many are not disengaged youth on the margins of society but rather the beginnings of a new black British middle-class.Is their anger genuine? Of course – but the passion has been stoked by social media which lacks any sense of nuance. It is hardly surprising, perhaps, that many young protestors, when interviewed, sound as if they are giving a paper for a Gender Studies or Sociology module. None of them can root what they say in their own experience. Instead they are living in a lala land of identity politics – waving phrases like “micro aggression” and “white privilege” as if they are red cards to be used every time they feel the world hasn’t been playing fair.There are enormous dangers in allowing the sweeping charge of “institutionalised racism” to go unchallenged – not least that it removes the power of the inidual.I’m not going to be an old grump and argue that my generation definitely had it harder. I admire the way these young people have been able to mobilise. Any marketing firm would be lucky to have them. But why not use that agency to support young black people to move away from knife crime? Or to encourage our youth to eat well, and exercise, and prevent rising obesity in our black communities?We know the biggest headache facing many black communities before lockdown was not police brutality, but knife crime. We know that certain black and Asian communities face disproportionate Covid-19 deaths, not caused by institutional racism, but by serious underlying health conditions, which need science and research. These aren’t straightforward problems and solving them will take more than a hashtag, but they are the sort of constructive projects that could really make a difference.For the past 15 years, I have run a charity called Generating Genius. We find the best black talent in science and technology, and work with students from the age of 15 through to university entrance. I realised that the next era of progress needed to tackle the real issue of social mobility: to recognise those with high aspirations, find a mechanism to develop their talent, and connect it with real opportunities. The biggest problem the students on our programme have now is too many job offerswhen they graduate.This is how the young generation can make Britain in the 2020s a better place to be black than it was for me in the 1980s. But there is a vacuum of leadership when it comes to talking about these matters. Young black people know politicians on both sides of the political spectrum have let them down. The gap needs to be filled by a leadership able to give young people a road map to develop their talents, and link them to opportunity.Such progress will not come through the simplistic lens of identity politics. Only when our young protesters abandon their navel-gazing will they succeed in their quest.Dr Tony Sewell is the chair and managing director of the charity Generating GeniusMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/06/09/TELEMMGLPICT000092348893_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8Asj1eHb3tSpQqwok7bWezxOl9TuFSr2udDuEW-7eOM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"black lives matter oxford cecil rhodes statue","story":"The Cecil Rhodes statue at the University of OxfordUniversity of OxfordA Black Lives Matter protest is being held in Oxford today amid calls for its statue of Cecil Rhodes to be pulled down.An online petition has gained more than 9,000 signatures and urges Oriel College at the University of Oxford to remove the statue.Rhodes was a 19th century businessman who protesters argue represents colonialism and racism.The planned protest comes after a Black Lives Matters demonstration in Bristol city centre on Sunday, during which a statue of Edward Colston was toppled over then dumped in the nearby harbour.A campaign to remove the Oxford statue of Rhodes was launched in 2016, called \u0027Rhodes Must Fall\u0027. But it failed to persuade the college to take action and the monument remained.A sign saying Rhodes, you\u0027re next was taped to University Church, opposite the statue on Sunday.In an open letter to the University of Oxford\u0027s vice-chancellor, campaigners said none of the demands of the movement have been met and student protests and concerns continue to be dismissed by senior members of the university.Oxford East MP Anneliese Dodds said: My view is that it staying where it is without any other symbol there that would highlight what occurred during those awful times is not helpful.Some people want an opposing symbol there, you have others who want it to be removed - for me the critical thing is to listen to the black community within Oxford and those who are directly impacted by this.I am not going to seek to speak for them, I don\u0027t think that would be helpful.Oxford West and Abingdon MP Layla Moran said while she did not endorse vigilante action she did believe the statue should go.The statues of white supremacists and slave merchants should not still be standing in our cities - that\u0027s why the statue of Cecil Rhodes must come down, she said.I\u0027m not endorsing vigilante action - but I would urge Oriel College in the strongest terms to think about what message this statue sends in 2020, and to remove it.At least 19 Oxford city councillors have called for the statue to be immediately removed in an open letter.A protest is planned in front of the statue today from 5pm.University of OxfordTate galleries could be renamed in review of London landmarks after Black Lives Matter protestsPolitics latest news: Education Secretary admits pupils will need support for \u0026#39full year and more\u0026#39 after school U-turn Coronavirus could kill off the Christmas panto season, warns theatre chief  Dog owner jailed after her pet killed nine-year-old boy in caravanPolice reviewing disappearance of another German girl in light of new Madeleine McCann suspect   Comment: These protesters are deluded if they think toppling statues is a victory for their causeBattersea murder suspect extradited and charged for Christmas Eve shootingPrince Andrew Charitable Trust breached law over £355,000 payment to former trustee Comment: How can ministers \u0026#39level up\u0026#39 Britain if schools remain shut for months on end?Comment: We must face down these selfish whingers who want to keep schools shutComment: This is the worst possible time to make orce easierFormer Miss Hitler beauty pageant contestant jailed with three others for being National Action membersOne in 16 care home residents killed by coronavirus epidemicCoronavirus positive: Good news round-up -

Spain has called for a common (EU-wide) approach to opening the borders. If this is not done, it will establish its own criteria, the source said.The British Government is coming under increased pressure over its quarantine policy. Critics have asked why it was not in place earlier and the aviation industry has warned it will hit jobs and tourism. Quash Quarantine, representing 500 travel and hospitality companies, said it had been told privately that air corridors would be in place from June 29.Airlines want the quarantine policy scrapped.

For me, one of the most impressive examples of a monument that evokes the horrors of the recent past but also speaks on behalf of the great mass of decent people is Carlos Colombino’s monument to General Stroessner in Asunción.Read the full piece. As life returns to normal in the German capital, staff at the Legoland Discovery Centre are not prepared to risk the health of one of the star attractions.Slovakia will allow free travel to and from 16 more European countries from June 10 and no longer require face masks to be worn outside, Prime Minister Igor Matovic said on Tuesday, as the country further eased its coronavirus lockdown.There will be no restrictions on visitors from Germany, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.Slovakia last week reopened borders with neighbours Czech Republic, Austria and Hungary.The country had imposed relatively strict restrictions including border closures before it reported any coronavirus cases, and has moved cautiously in reopening.Bhutan, one of the most enigmatic travel destinations in the world, is declining to set a date for the return of international visitors. Dorji Dhradhul, director general of the Tourism Council of Bhutan, told Lonely Planet, “while we also hope for the quick restart and reopening of our tourism, it is of course dependent on positive developments globally. Therefore, we do not have a date set for reopening as yet.”The Tiger\u0026#39s Nest monastery in BhutanThe Asian nation, often ranked as one of the happiest countries in the world, has had just 59 coronavirus cases.

The premise of the scheme, which hopes to one day include as many as 50 parks, is to offer natural areas near cities with culturally relevant quiet experiences.Stockholm, New York, London and Portland are next on the list of possible sites. Ulf Bohman, executive director of Urban Quiet Parks, said: Cities around the world should identify, protect and make accessible places in nature that are dedicated to silence in the outer sense and stillness in the inner sense.Vikram Chauhan, President and co-founder of Quiet Parks International, added: We need more certified quiet places - especially in an urban environment - for the benefit of all life.

For Cunard, where we celebrate having a truly international mix of guests and sail all over the world, this becomes particularly impactful. We also need to better understand the implications Covid-19 will have on board our ships.Affected guests will be given a 125 per cent future cruise credit on cancelled voyages. New York City has begun to reopen today, with the first of four phases of easing lockdown. NYC Go, the city’s tourist board, has said it is planning a “safe, responsible, citywide comeback” across its five boroughs. The first phase allows for a number of shops to reopen for delivery and “curbside” and in-store pickup, while the second phase, which will not start for at least two weeks, will see restaurants reopen for outdoor dining. The city\u0026#39s five boroughs, including Brooklyn, pictured, can begin to reopenNew Yorkers can now gather in small groups of 10 people, as long as social distancing guidelines are followed residents must also wear face coverings in public. To aid social distancing, New York is closing 40 miles of streets, widening its pavements and adding bike lanes. New York City was one of the US cities hit hardest by the coronavirus, recording more than 17,000 deaths.As travel restrictions ease around Europe, the dates given by airlines to resume services are looking more and more concrete. Jet2, Tui and Virgin Atlantic have all issued recent updates to their schedules.See here for the latest on when airlines plan to begin flights again. Some more detail on the nearing of bilateral air travel agreements. Paul Charles, spokesperson for the Quash Quarantine campaign group and chief executive of travel consultancy, the PC Agency, has asked for greater clarity from the Government. He said:The Quash Quarantine group, consisting of over 500 travel and hospitality companies seeking to overturn the recently-introduced quarantine measures, has received private assurances from senior Government sources that travel corridors will be in place from  June 29.We urge the government to signal to the travel industry publicly and urgently that this is the case, as well as amend FCO advice on non-essential travel. We are still considering our options regarding legal action, including whether to join BA’s claim or launch our own action, but would prefer that June 29 is confirmed as soon as possible for the start of travel corridors.

The new chips will initially come to Apple\u0027s laptops in a change that could be announced as soon as this month, Bloomberg reported.The change would allow the computers to drastically improve their speed, battery life and other key parts of their performance, numerous reports have suggested, as well as bringing the computers more in line with Apple\u0027s iPhones and iPads, for which it has long made its own chips.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe announcement is set to be made at Apple\u0027s Worldwide Developers Conference or WWDC event, which begins on 22 June, according to the same report. It noted that Apple\u0027s plans are still subject to change and that the announcement of the change could therefore be delayed.Apple has long been rumoured to be working on a move to use ARM chips in its laptops, rather than the current Intel ones used across all of its Macs. In addition to the reputed gains from designing its own chips, the decision is said to be the result of ongoing frustration with relying on Intel\u0027s release schedule to dictate the timing of Apple\u0027s updates and new launches.Apple\u0027s homepage taken over by message about racismChanging would mark the first ever time that Apple has designed its own chips for its Mac line, ever since it was first announced 36 years ago.The company started using Intel chips in 2006, when it switched away from PowerPC architecture, in what was one of the company\u0027s most significant moments. That change required Apple\u0027s Mac OS software to be re-written, as well as forcing third-party software to adjust to the change.The new report from Bloomberg says that Apple will announce the new, similar change during its WWDC event, which begins 22 June. Apple is yet to reveal details about how that event – which usually begins with a large on-stage keynote, but will be held online-only because of the coronavirus outbreak – will actually be run, or how it intends to make the announcements without an audience.Traditionally, Apple holds the keynote on the first day, with technical sessions for developers running through the rest of the week, and it is expected to continue on a similar timetable. The same event is also expected to see performance improvements for the rest of its line-up, as well as new fitness features in the Apple Watch.Announcing the change during that event would give developers time to adjust to the new architecture before the new computers arrive in 2021, Bloomberg claimed. As such, the timing of the announcement could change and Apple may still not actually announce it during its WWDC event, the report suggested.The new processors will use the same technology that is found in the iPhone and iPad, for which Apple is able to design its own chips. Those devices have improved at a much more rapid rate than Apple\u0027s computers, and some iPads and iPhones now boast better performance on some metrics than their much larger counterparts.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The latest study, which involved 2,254 British adults, also revealed that around six in 10 people experienced worse sleep since lockdown began on 23 March.Charting Sweden’s no lockdown strategy“Nearly two-thirds of the UK public report some negative impact on their sleep from the Covid-19 crisis, clearly showing just how unsettling the pandemic and lockdown measures have been for a very large proportion of us,” said Professor Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London.“And this is clearly tied to both how stressful we’ve found the virus itself, and how much we fear the impact of the lockdown on our employment and finances.”Data gathered in April by wearable technology firm Withings showed that people in the UK had been sleeping for 15 minutes longer on average each day during the lockdown.France saw the biggest increase in daily sleep times, with the average person sleeping for an extra 20 minutes each night.These findings can be partly explained by people not having to commute to work due to either working from home or not working at all during lockdown.Similar data from fitness tracking firm Polar revealed that people in Germany are also sleeping for longer.A significant increase in sleep time was recorded by Polar’s sleep-tracking devices as lockdown measures were introduced in Germany on 22 March.Researchers at University College London (UCL) are currently studying the effects lockdowns are having on people’s mental health.Early results suggest that higher levels of anxiety and depression are linked to lockdown restrictions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers have been unable to find how the bursts could be created, with the only certainty being that the very short but very powerful blasts must be emerging from some unknown, very extreme part of the universe.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe bursts come in a roughly 90 day window, which is then followed by a silent period for 67 days. The pattern then repeats, leaving a reliable 157 day period that was tracked over multiple years.That long pattern could suggest that the blasts are linked to the swirling, orbital motion of a massive star, a neutron star or a black hole.Mysterious signals coming from space answer matter puzzleThis is an exciting result as it is only the second system where we believe we see this modulation in burst activity, said Kaustubh Rajwade of The University of Manchester, who led the new research. Detecting a periodicity provides an important constraint on the origin of the bursts and the activity cycles could argue against a precessing neutron star.Fast radio bursts were first discovered in 2007, and were initially thought to be the result of a one-off event. Scientists then found in 2016 that FRB 121102 was in fact repeating.In the latest research, scientists then studied the source of the FRB using telescopes at Jodrell Bank, which allowed for regular monitoring over a long period that revealed the blast could be seen to be coming in a repeating patter when watched for a long time.This result relied on the regular monitoring possible with the Lovell Telescope, and non-detections were just as important as the detections, said Benjamin Stappers, who leads the MeerTRAP project to hunt for FRBs using the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, in a statement.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The ignorance and indifference of white people allows a level of complicity, so you contribute by not being aware.”She then went on to explain that racial biases are commonplace in the country’s education, healthcare and judicial systems, as well as the barriers put in place “when it comes to loans and insurance, house and home ownership and opening a small business”.Jennifer Lawrence: America’s Sweetheart in the digital age She continued: “I need to speak and I need to say these things so white people do become aware that your privilege allows you to benefit from a system that chronically affects and damages black people, and now that you’re aware of that, it’s not enough to just say ‘I’m not racist’ because you’re not a purveyor of overt racism. “If you benefit from the system, knowing that people are being oppressed and affected by it, then you are racist. To be anti-racist you have to be actively a part of dismantling the systems that surround you and the systems that you benefit from.”Elsewhere on BBC News, Jamelia also called upon Boris Johnson to properly tackle systemic racism in the UK.In a statement, the prime minister said he did not approve of protesters “flouting social distancing”, following a weekend of protest against police brutality and historic and systemic racism in the UK.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I don’t care if I lose fans and I already know that some people who have posted have lost a lot of fans and I just think it’s disgusting, but it just proves what we’re saying.”Jennifer Lawrence: America’s Sweetheart in the digital age Pinnock said that she first spoke openly about her experiences with racism in 2019, but “didn’t feel like enough people cared”. She said that she was so “overwhelmed” by Floyd’s death that she felt she should reiterate them.“Now I just feel like people are starting to understand and educate themselves and see that this problem is massive and we need to talk about it and there needs to be a change because we just can’t go on like this anymore,” she explained. “Four hundred years of oppression, it just can’t go on anymore.”She continued: “It’s actually been such a weight lifted for me. I was hearing from people who have been in the same sort of experiences that I have, so being the black girl in their band in the pop industry, saying how they felt exactly the same way as me and I’ve never ever had conversations with people who have had similar experiences as me.”Stars including Normani, formerly of Fifth Harmony, and Shaznay Lewis, of All Saints, tweeted their support for Pinnock’s statements.In response to Pinnock, her Little Mix bandmate Jade Thirlwall condemned media outlets for confusing the pair in images.“This s*** happens ALL THE TIME,” Thirlwall wrote. Highlighting an article about Pinnock that used an image of Thirlwall to illustrate it, she added: “You might want to make sure you’re using an image of the correct mixed race member of the group.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Very little is being done behind the scenes. Unfortunately, Hollyoaks’ response seems to me performative and disingenuous.“Working at Hollyoaks is mostly positive, but the experiences I have encountered are a constant reminder of how difficult it is being a black woman in the industry,” she added. “I am no longer standing for it.”Responding to the former X Factor contestant, Hollyoaks wrote on their Instagram page: “Hollyoaks has zero tolerance on racism.

Nick Kondo — the lead animator for Sony Imageworks who worked on the first film — took to Twitter to share his excitement about the beginning of filming. Kondo posted a 10-second animated clip which announced that the sequel would arrive in 2022 alongside the caption: “First day on the job!”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe original Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse follows Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) as he becomes Spider-Man. Crossing paths with counterparts from other dimensions, the Spider-People team up to stop Wilson Fisk – also known as the Kingpin – as he presents a threat to all realities.The first Spider-Verse film was a critical and box office hit. It grossed over $375million (£300m) worldwide against a $90million (£60m) budget and won numerous awards, including Best Animated Feature at the 91st Academy Awards, 46th Annie Awards, and 76th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first non-DisneyPixar film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature since Rango (2011).The follow-up Spider-Verse film will focus on the growing relationship between Miles and Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld), a Spider-Woman from another dimension.The original animation features a number of secret cameos from Stan Lee — the famed comic-book writer who created such Marvel characters the X-Men, Iron Man and Spider-Man.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That link then takes users to a Twitter page entitled “No, 5G isn’t causing coronavirus”, with articles, government information, and tweets from other fact-checking organisations about the conspiracy theory.Speaking to Business Insider, the social media site said:  “Last month, we announced that we are introducing new labels and warning messages to provide additional context and information on some Tweets containing disputed or misleading information related to COVID-19.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTwitter has tried to avoid removing tweets completely, unless such tweets contain “a call to action that could potentially cause harm”. This is part of the reason why tweets from prominent users such as Elon Musk, who incorrectly stated that children are “essentially immune” to the coronavirus, remain on the site.“As we\u0027ve said previously, we will not take enforcement action on every Tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19. Last month, we announced that we are introducing new labels and warning messages to provide additional context and information on some Tweets containing disputed or misleading information related to COVID-19,” a Twitter spokesperson said.Twitter bans Trump\u0027s tribute video to George Floyd over copyrightPrevious action taken by Twitter has included removing fake content and misinformation, hiding misleading tweets with warnings, and linking people to government information when they search for 5G-related news.Twitter is applying this new label widely, meaning many tweets that simply reference the connection between 5G and the coronavirus now include the note. As such, many Twitter users have made jokes using the label. “Labeling or placing a warning on Tweets continues to be an iterative process,” Twitter told Engadget.The link between 5G and the coronavirus has resulted in cell tower masts set alight and engineers being harassed by people incorrectly believing the conspiracy theory. It appears that the myth started circulating in early January from a now-deleted article in a Dutch-language newspaper and since then the belief has been propagated on social media and shared by numerous celebrities.However, such beliefs can be easily debunked. The coronavirus continues to spread in countries which do not have access to 5G such as Iran, and 5G connectivity in the UK and China exists between 4G and the 5GHz Wi-Fi range that many people have had in their homes prior to the pandemic.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

But organisers sprang into action after the lockdown began, by providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help — I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we reply on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”How to support our campaignThe Felix Project, which is delivering daily to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school by delivering one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The food surplus charity has since increased the weekly supply to 40 trays full of food to help school organisers cope with the huge demand.Mr Causton said: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.”He added: “It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The school’s programme is also given regular supply of food from Kitchen Social, a Mayor’s Fund for London programme.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Fears are growing that some regions in the UK could be on the cusp of a second wave of Covid-19 infections after research suggested that the rate of infection was back to around one in the North West and the South West.It comes after thousands of sunseekers travelled to beauty spots across the south coast after the government announced days in advance that lockdown would be eased from  1 June.Following the move, crowds of revellers descended on Durdle Door in Dorset and other beaches last week to lap up the sun while enjoying drinks and picnics, in what amounted to a party-like atmosphere.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince then, council leaders and MPs have called on the government to take greater action to allow coastal communities to protect themselves against the virus.Last week, Brighton and Hove City Council called for the government to grant it more powers to implement its own lockdown measures in a bid to keep visitors of its beach.Hundreds ignore police warnings and flock to beach at Durdle DoorMeanwhile, Dorset Council leader Spencer Flower wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging him to limit travel to within the home counties, warning that lockdown rules have a disproportionately negative impact on coastal communities.“I am worried that we will see a second wave of infection here in Dorset as a result of the high number of visitors to the area over recent days,” Mr Flower wrote.“I’m asking the government to act now to save the lives of Dorset residents. My plea to the government is to review the unrestricted travel guidelines currently in place and require people instead to stay local.”With summer fast approaching and the R rate appearing to be on the rise in two regions, could the UK shut its beaches in the event of a second wave?Police officer kicked in the face after dispersing beach gatheringThe ownership of Britain’s beaches is complicated, with many sites not in public ownership. It is estimated that the Crown Estate controls around 45 per cent of England’s foreshore.The remaining 55 per cent lays in the hands of the National Trust, the Ministry of Defence and other organisations as well as private iniduals. This means that it is not always in the power of local authorities to shut beaches.One council in the South West of England told The Independent that it could only shut its beaches in a state of emergency.A spokesperson for No.10 said it was up to councils to decide whether or not to close beaches.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

How Boris Johnson dropped his promise to reject US chlorinated chickenGovernment ready to open British markets to chlorinated chickenUS negotiators have made clear that opening the door to American agricultural exports, which are produced to much lower welfare standards than their European counterparts, is their primary demand in talks in the UK.While the government’s own best-case scenarios says an agreement with the US would lead to a tiny boost to the UK economy of just 0.16 per cent of GDP, failing to sign such a deal would be highly politically embarrassing for Boris Johnson, who has presented such an arrangement as part of the alternative to EU membership.Selaine Saxby, a Conservative MP from Devon, said during a question session in the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon that a large number of farmers and constituents had contacted her concerned about food standards.Can my right honourable friend assure me and my constituents that we will maintain our current food standards and prevent the import of chlorinated chicken and other inferior food? she asked ministers.Cabinet office minister Penny Mordaunt replied: I think in this we should be trusting the consumer. If people don\u0027t want to put their faith in government we should trust the consumer. think consumers want high quality, fairly priced foods with high quality animal welfare standards.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The communication, to MPs, said the UK was “firmly committed to upholding our high environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards outside the EU”.But the National Farmers\u0027 Union warned that the letter was open to interpretation and that the assurances provided no safeguards if we have a concern about the animal welfare or environmental impact of a certain production method, according to trade publication The Grocer.Downing Street signalled last Thursday that imports of lower-standard American food were now on the table in the negotiations, a reversal of a longstanding promise.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A woman looks on during a protest against the killing of George Floyd in Osaka city, western Japan.

It was reported last week that the UK is going to take a dual tariff approach to the imports, allowing American meats in even if they do not meet some British production standards, but also charging tariffs.If US food exports do make it to the UK, British consumers may be denied information about which products are American to help them get a foothold in the market. The US Department for Trade\u0027s Foreign barriers trade 2019 document catalogues policies in countries around the world the US wants ended. The document says the US has “consistently raised concerns” about country of origin labelling at the World Trade Organisation, notably because of “the potential to favour select countries, and the impact on US exports”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The government hopes to have all secondaries and primaries to open for “more” pupils in September, and for years 10 and 12 to have some face-to-face access to teachers after 15 June.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUnder a roadmap to easing the coronavirus lockdown unveiled last month, the government’s plan was “for all primary school children to return to schools before the summer for a month if feasible”. Last week, primary schools across the country began a phased reopening, with the government requesting that children in nursery, year one and year six, began returning to classes.Created with Sketch.How coronavirus lockdowns changed the world\u0027s most polluted cities Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.But addressing MPs in the Commons, Mr Williamson said: “I know that schools need time to put in place strict protective measures. “The safety of our children, young people and staff remains my priority,” he added. “We are not able to welcome all primary school children back before the summer for a full month.”We all know how important it is for children and young people to be in education and childcare and it is vital that we get them back there as soon as the scientific advice indicates that we can.While welcoming the move, the cabinet minister’s opposite number Rebecca Long-Bailey said for weeks headteachers, unions and staff have “warned that the plans to open primary schools before the summer were simply impractical while implementing social distancing safely”. The shadow education secretary added: If the government had brought together everyone involved in implementing these plans from the outset and really taken on board what they had to say, they would not be in the situation of having to roll back at all.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So, what is the Government doing to help these disadvantaged children learn again and avoid an epidemic of educational poverty?Can we have a long-term plan for education for a catch-up premium to look after these left-behind children and will he also reconsider ensuring that these children get free school meals over the summer given the financial anxieties their families have to face during the current pandemic?Mr Williamson also insisted the government would not “hesitate” to act if the R rate of infection reaches above one in local areas amid concerns about the prevalence of coronavirus in certain regions. “If robust data shows local action needs to be taken, we will not hesitate to do so. But we are not in that position.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Their risk of death or severe infection is extremely low.The balance of risk is strongly toto school.Even though experts say children shouldto school, experts acknowledged that social distancing would be hard to maintain and also said parents have a responsibility to remain vigilant.Prof Chris Bonell highlighted that it was also important that contact between parents at the schools gates was also assessed.The level of contact tracing will be the key thing for opening schools, we will need to knowmeasures are working, but teachers wont have time to be filling out questionnaires to help with this.Guidance on whether or not people in the UK should be wearing face masks has been a widely debated issue.While there is little evidence to back up claims that masks can protect you from becoming infected - experts say they can stop an infected person from spreading the disease.Current advice from the UK Government states that you should wear a face covering or maskyou take public transport oryou go to a supermarket.You do not have to wear them when you are exercising.But the Government does suggest face masks are not suitable for very young children.Government advice states: “Face-coverings should not be used by children under the age of two, or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly, for example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions.”As it stands the children ing to school will all be of primary age and the advice would mean that they do not have to wear them.But as inidual schools have rebelled against the Governments plans saying they will not open schools, it may be that inidual headteachers and local councils make these decisions for their schools.The Government states: Schools and other education or childcare settings should therefore not require staff, children and learners to wear face coverings.Changing habits, cleaning and hygiene are effective measures in controlling the spread of the virus.The coronavirus lockdown has affected everyones normal routine.Many parents are at home with their children all day and for many kids, it might be hard to understand whats going on.This sht in routine has seen many children struggle as they are away from their peers and from their normal lives.But older children, who are more aware of the situation may feel uncomfortable about going back to school.Many children are aware of the virus and the changes around them but its important to talk to your children about what they should expect when ing to schools and what the pandemic means.Dr Lucy Viney from The Fitzrovia Psychology Clinic in London said parents shouldnt be afraid to discuss the pandemic with their children.Your goal is to help your child feel informed and get fact-based information that is likely to be more reassuring than whatever they’re hearing from their friends or on the news.. Do not be afraid to discuss the coronavirus with your child: Your goal is to help your child feel informed and get fact-based information that is likely to be more reassuring than whatever they’re hearing from their friends or on the news.. Allow your child space to share their worries and fears: For example, you could say: “I understand that all these changes are making you feel worried. It’s OK to feel worried when everything seems dferent. I’m so pleased you have let me know how you’re feeling”.. Identy non-verbal opportunities for emotional expression: For example, it can be helpful to draw pictures of things that your child has noticed each day or to ask them to choose some music to listen to together that reflects how they are feeling.. Focus on what you’re doing to stay safe and healthy, such as hand-washing: This is empowering for children because it gives them tools and knowledge to help keep themselves and others safe, and something that they can focus on.. Establish a daily routine: It can be helpful to integrate activities that you used to do before the coronavirus outbreak, such as eating together, watching a TV show or going to for an evening walk.. Find regular opportunities for meaningful conversations: If possible, try to find an opportunity each day to spend between - minutes of ‘special time’ with each of your children. The basic premises of ‘special time’ are that you specy theof timeand the location, and your child chooses the activity.   This ‘special time’ should be free from any external distractions, such as phone calls.. Look after your mental wellbeing too: Practice self-care and invest in your own wellbeing. It’s important to remember that you can only do what you can manage at this time and that every day doesn’t have to be ‘perfect’.Dr Lucy added that you need to allow your child space and time to reflect on how they are feeling.For example, you could say: I understand that all these changes are making you feel worried.It’s OK to feel worried when everything seems dferent. I’m so pleased you have let me know how you’re feeling.She added that you should also make sure your child is aware of the ious hygiene principles such as hand washing and social distancingthey see you actively doing these activities they will be more inclined to do them for themselves.During this time its easy to think you are being over protective of your childrenyou dont want to send them back to school.But youre not alone, as a recent survey suggested that parents do not want lockdown to be lted until September, meaning many dont want their kids to go back until the next school year.Two in three parents believe lockdown should stay in place until at least June, with . per cent saying the lockdown should remain until September, according to a UK-wide poll of , parents led by learner provider, Exemplar Education.Its important that you address these worries and each parent should assess their situation inidually, whats right for you might not always be right for your friends and neighbours.Dr Lucy highlighted that its important for parents to make sure their own mental health needs are catered for during this time.This is while Steve O’Hara, director of education for Exemplar Education said: “The Covid- pandemic has had an unbelievable impact on the day to day lives of families everywhere.Parents and children are in unfamiliar territory and trying their very best to face the challenges that learning from home brings.It’s vital for parents to be able to talk freely about these challenges and to take care of their own mental wellbeing over the course of the lockdown.Sharing worries will help all of us feel less stress and concerned and help us take some of the pressure off.”One big concern during this time is that children would miss out on vital education.Downing Street published Sage documents that do warn the effects of lockdown could affect childrens education and work prospects for the rest of their lives.While many schools have provided home schooling resources, some households may not be able to access them, while other parents may not feel comfortable home schooling their kids.As many as . per cent of parents reported dficulties in supporting their children with learning from home.In a clear sign that many parents nationwide are feeling the strain a further . per cent said they do not feel equipped to support their children’s learning.Mr OHara added: Many are extremely concerned about lockdown coming to an end too suddenly, yet are anxious about their children’s learning and their own personal ability to support them at home.While some children will be missing out on the education aspect of the lockdown, others will also be struggling in the constrained social environment.The education secretary warned of dire consequences to learningchildren did notto school in May.Gavin Williamson said that children stand to lose more by staying away from schools.Reassuring parents that schools would be made safe he said: School staff can already be tested for the virus, but from the first of June well extend that to cover children and their familiesany of them develop symptoms.This is while Labours Rebecca Long-Bailey said that children in older age groups should not be forced to catch up on what they have missed out on during the lockdown period.Speaking to TES she said: “What we are going to see when we get back to the classroom is those students who are in families where their parents are lucky enough be able to afford tutors, or those who can hothouse, will catch up very quickly.And everybody  won’t be able to do that, and then you’ve got a whole generation of pupils who could fall through the cracks and their prospects will be affected and they won’t be able to get jobs in the future.”During the lockdown, many nurseries, like schools have remained open to support parents of children who are key workers.Many have been running at a limited capacity, but workers are still generally having the same amount of contact with children as they did before.Busy Bees – which has  centres across the UK and Ireland – has confirmed its health and safety plans will not include those stringent measures.Kids will be able to play in smaller groups and teachers will work on iding children into close friendship groups to limit the number of people they come into contact with.They will also reduce the space that children can explore and increase the time they spend outdoors.Playdough, sandpits and water games will be banned in a bid to prevent the killer bug from spreading around nurseries.All children and staff will have their temperature checked upon arrival, and those families waiting to enter the nursery will be asked to wait two metres apart at drop off and pick up.Regular temperature checks for both children and team members will continue throughout the day, as will frequent handwashing and disinfecting of communal areas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As the school reopens to more children, we are now asking that children wear school unorm. We acknowledge that this may be dficult for some families and we suggest that this could be supplemented with non-unorm clothing when needed.The Sun has found that schools are generally keen to have kids wearing clothes which are easy to wash, as a precaution against spreading the coronavirus.So, for practical reasons some are telling parents to forget about traditional schoolwear, and aim for the likes of T-shirts, hoodies and joggers.As no firm rule has been set by government officials for wearing - or not wearing - unorms, its best to check your childs school website for guidance.Its best to contact your child’s school for its specic arrangements for PE lessons, as theres also no government guidance on this activity.A check of school websites by The Sun shows that many are asking parents not to send kids to school with PE gear - particularly those requiring youngsters to ditch unorms for sportswear in classrooms.That means they can carry out any activity without the need to change.But they do want kids to wear fresh clothes every day.Hoole CE Primary School in Chester, for example, states that pupils are not required to bring PE kit into school. This is so clothing worn during the day can be washed immediately when your child s home. We ask that children dress appropriately for school so that they do not need to change for outdoor activities, for example, leggings, shorts, jogging bottoms, T-shirts, sweatshirts, pumps or trainers, it adds.Given the sunny weather, children are being advised to have a hat and long-sleeved tops for protection against sunburn.The Education Secretary will lay out his plan for more children ing to schools on June .Gavin Williamson will give a statement on how the government intends to get more children into the classrooms.He could touch on additional changes to the running of schools and what is expected of students and staff.Schools have had to change the way they run to keep people safe.For example, the Department for Education recommends:  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris wants distancing cut to one metre, giving the all-clear for pubs and restaurants to reopen and start rehiring the millions laid off since lockdown.Rishi Sunak is counting on this to trim Treasury job-support measures costing the economy a dizzying £billion.It will kickstart a new-normal summer, with open-air weddings, beer-garden service and marquees to protect punters from the rain.Summer holidays are back on track after being stymied for weeks.Airlines will bypass quarantine with air corridors to approved holiday destinations such as Italy, France, Greece and Turkey.These measures are not risk-free. Scientists point to a possible surge in Covid cases in the North.But equally reputable experts insist there is little chance of a second wave.The risk of the NHS failing to cope has now passed.Meanwhile, lockdown has brought its own death toll. Countless lives have certainly been lost from failure to diagnose and treat cancers and heart diseases.The price in lost schooling and crippled le chances will be paid for decades to come.Lting lockdown is a tough decision for any prime minister.But, as Boris knows better than most, to lead is to choose.

It’s quite bad isn’t it  If nobody has told you it’s a problem.”The passenger laughed and responded: “Yeah. I still have other issues right now so I wanted to go to the hospital.”Other travellers landing at Heathrow also said there were no real checks were in place and described the system as a “shambles”.On arrival, people must now fill out forms detailing where they will be staying for the two-week period.But passengers claim no specic checks were made as they entered Britain on day one of the new rules. One man told MailOnline he was headed straight for work.He said: “If Boris wants us to stay off public transport then he should arrange taxis for us all. Ive got to get to work.”And a woman arriving from Washington said: “I could have been lying the whole time.“I completed the online form before I left and when I arrived at Heathrow the immigration official asked me to repeat the address where I said I would be quarantining.“After that he just let me pass and didnt check at allwhat I had put down is true.”Another man on Twitter said his friend arrived at Heathrow “coughing everywhere” but was simply waved through. A passenger from Tel Aviv told the Evening Standard it was “chaos” as his plane landed at Heathrow.He said: “I had no idea of the quarantine. When I arrived there were long queues.”And Ali Gurlek, from London, who landed at Stansted Airport from Eindhoven in the Netherlands, said: “We didn’t know we had to fill in the form so had to do it when we arrived. “There were queues. I agree with the quarantine but this is a shambles.”A leaked Home Office document also revealed there is no method for Border Force to ensure details on entry forms are genuine.Under the new laws, ing UK residents can quarantine at home.Those without accommodation will be provided somewhere to stay by the government.The only reasons people are allowed to leave quarantine are for urgent medical attention, support from social services, food and medicinethey cannot be delivered, a funeral of a close relative, or an emergency.Police will be conducting checks to ensure people are self-isolating - and anyone flouting the rules faces a fine of up to £, and even jail.It means holidays abroad are unlikely for most people this summer.The new restrictions are in place alongside a non-essential travel ban which has seen thousands of Brits have their trips cancelled.Countries have closed their borders and airlines grounded their fleet as people are warned not to travel.But Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary claims thousands of Brit families are planning to jet off on holiday anyway.He said Ryanair has planes ready to head out to Portugal, Spain and Italy next month.He told Radio ’s Today programme: “Ryanairs taking about , daily fights from July  to destinations all over Europe, from every airport in the UK.“We are seeing thousands of British families booking their two-week holiday, because they themselves expect they wont be affected by the quarantine when theyhome.“I think the outbound holiday season will be fine - weve seen British families over the last two weeks book holidays abroad in Portugal, Spain, etc in their thousands.”Passengers arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are exempt from the -day quarantine.And holidaymakers could use this loophole to dodge self-isolation.British travellers could come home via Dublin - being dubbed the Dublin dodge - making them exempt. It would see them avoid Irelands coronavirus quarantine rules which do not apply to people with onward journeys to the UK.Several other groups, including freight and healthcare workers, are also on the list that do not have to self-isolate.The measures will be reviewed by the government every three weeks. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PM’s spokesman said: “We do want to be able to reopen pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes as soon as possible, but it must be safe to do so.“We’re working to develop a safe way for them to reopen at the earliest opportunity through our pubs taskforce. That work is going well. The roadmap sets out our ambition is to open these from th of July.”A government source suggested some in Whitehall were trying to bounce Downing Street into announcing an earlier date because they were thirsty for a pint.It followed reports in the Financial Times that three Whitehall officials said the target date was June .The trade body representing pubs and brewers last night demanded “immediate and clear” clarication over the reopening date.The British Beer  Pub Association warned that the confusion risked deepening the crisis already facing the sector and said pub owners needed certainty in order to plan.It said the Government must stick by its commitment to reopen pubs from July  or face millions more job losses. Pubs also want the Government to reduce the two metre social distancing rule to one metre.That plan was dealt a blow yesterday as the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health warned the move would cause a second spike in coronavirus cases. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A delaying-the-inevitable tactic which meant, by the time Phil and Dennis’s tickets for the April  game between West Ham and Burnley arrived in mid May, the fixture was as dead as Dennis.A lucky escapeyou ask me.The day of reckoning, when it runs out of episodes, fast approaches, of course. For the duration of the outbreak, though, it’s been a biological miracle.Regulars have packed The Vic, mobbed the Bridge Street market and just stood around gawping and muttering, in their usual community-serving way, when Keegan’s sandwich van was trashed by the local drug dealers.The presence of a global pandemic hasn’t stopped EastEnders lecturing us about other medical issues, obviously.Since the boat party accident, in February, it’s been particularly concerned about Ben Mitchell’s deafness, which cut no ice with me for a couple of good reasons.Firstly, Ben Mitchell is a dreadful, immoral, six-headed little turd who it’s impossible to like, let alone love.Secondly, they’d forgotten he was partially deaf for most of the previous decade.There’s not an international crisis or continuity glitch in the universe that can stand in the way of EastEnders’ moral grandstanding, though, so they decided viewers should “see and hear” last week’s heist episode, with Barry Grant off Brookside, through the eyes and ears of Ben.A particularly gormless enterprise, this one, which went off like Norman Collier and Jimi Hendrix on the same bill at The Half Moon in Putney, and was all feedback and missing words.To ram home the message for the hard of thinking, the action was also accompanied by word cloud subtitles that appeared to have been written by Tarzan.“Keep mind on job.”“Cut power.”“Ben, this mistake.”“Daughter without father.”Compared with other EastEnders episodes, I enjoyed it a lot. I usually do when the show tries something a bit dferent and thought you could actually write the entire history of the show in half a dozen lines of this new Tarzan-speak.“Den hate Angie.” “Peter change head.” “Phil. Him shot.” “You not mother.” “Me am mother.” “Peter change head again.” “Get out pub.” It’d be timely as well. After  years and four months of almost constant shouting and stall-minding, EastEnders goes off air next week.Tantalisingly, The Sun’s very own Andy Halls reported, on Friday, that when it s the show will have dropped its old storylines. A dream scenario which allowed me to fantasise about EastEnders .. A happier, funnier show that’s only on twice a week, where the BBC doesn’t endlessly bask in its own right-on virtue and the majority of characters actually sound like Londoners, instead of stage-schooleditorials.But that’s not going to happen, is it So I’m just going to enjoy the silence. Tarzan like.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in the Midlands shares its name with a meeting between two sporting rivals ”Bill: “Birmingham.”Celebrity Mastermind, John Humphrys: “In an th century poem, what season of the year did Keats describe as ‘a season of mists and mellow fruitfulness’ ”Monty Panesar: “Oliver Twist.”Ben Shephard: “The Anglo-Dutch wars were fought primarily between England and which modern-day country ”Amy: “Denmark.”.THE Last Leg, Desiree Burch on the George Floyd fallout: “Follow black artists and thinkers on social media, people who have good resources, information, opinions and insights. Right now I have two shows you could watch — Desiree’s Coming Early and Tar Baby.”Or you could watch Too Hot To Handle, where Netflix films young people having sex while artist thinker Desiree offers her “insights and opinions”.But she’s clearly too modest to mention her role on that one.THIS week’s winner is Tory MP Andrew Bridgen and Harry Enfield’s Tim Nice But Dim. Sent in by RJ.FIRST job for the Beeb’s new Director General, Tim Davie  Find out how Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer ended up on primetime, Saturday night, BBC. Seriously, how  It’s a late-night ITV show, with no one to bleep out the swearing, but with BBC levels of over-manning.The star, obviously, was Peter Crouch, who’s actually funnier than  per cent of TV comedians and more likable than all of them, but not yet ready to front his own show. So they added Maya Jama, who looked sensational in her Status Quo Blue For You-era denims, the compulsory Horne Section and Chris Ramsey, who was hiding behind a fence at the start. And should’ve stayed there. All deserve our sympathy. SOS was meant to be a Euro  spin-off and when the tournament vanished so did the show’s point. Camera angles also seem to have gone to hell, but that’s maybe an act of socially distanced mercy given what’s happening front and centre.Saturday’s content included: A teabag- flipping contest between Mo Farah and Ellie Simmonds, parachuting with Jermaine Jenas, which was straight off the Alan Partridge script and foul-mouthed football “bantz” from Rio Ferdinand, who said his career was ended by Peter Crouch, so may have been playing keepy-uppy to the Match Of The Day theme tune as some sort of twisted payback.The really alarming thing, though, is the series lasts eight weeks.Save Our Summer  At this rate, there’ll be a dark cloud hanging over autumn as well.For the record, it was the BBC News.SPRINGWATCH’s Steve Backshall wearing a “No planet B” T-shirt like he’s a -year-old student, rather than a -year-old BBC presenter who won’t shut up about his three kids. Bafta giving nominations to The Greatest Dancer and The Ranganation but not a Best Drama nod to Line Of Duty.This Morning’s Phillip Schofield losing his very short temper with John Torode over yoghurt dressing. Anyone who says “chowing down” instead of eating. And the clearly smitten GMB host Susanna Reid making an involuntary groping gesturewith her left hand, just after she says the name Keir Starmer. Easy tiger.PETER Crouch: “It wasn’t all about improving, it was also about getting better.”Ian Wright: “The one thing about Gerrard was his professionalism and the fact he was so versatile.”Paul Merson: “It was definitely half an open goal.”                                 SKY Documentaries’ McMillion, the best show on TV.Ralph’s wedding on The A Word. ITV’s th birthday tribute to the great Bradley Walsh.The GMB spat between Piers Morgan and Donald Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, which had everything except the obvious reprimand: “Rudy. Stop your messin’ around.”And Channel ’s Murder In The Outback, where disgraced Australian lawyer Andrew Fraser proves, beyond much forensic doubt, Bradley Murdoch did indeed kill Peter Falconio.The only slight glitch being, he’s trying to prove the exact opposite.Watch it, Channel , tonight and tomorrow, pm. The self-delusion becomes hypnotic. A Gillian Burke on Springwatch B Connell Waldron on Normal People C Comedian Tom Allen on nearly everything MOST surprising thing about Britain’s Best Parent  Anita Rani isn’t the most annoying person on this Channel  show.In fact, she’s not even close to a medal position thanks to the other five – two couples and a single mum – who must champion their own style of parenting, whether  it’s “pushy” or “vegan” or mollycoddling or just sort of lying around in bed all day treating their offspring as the hired help.Like the rest of us, Channel  silently understands, of course, listening to strangers talk about their small children is no more engaging or enlightening than listening to a ­scientologist talk about L. Ron Hubbard, so they’ve included a few eccentrics to liven  up the process.On the one hand there’s martial arts enthusiast Robin, who explains: “Our parenting style is influenced by eastern philosophy.

It’s very rare.Evidence from some of the earliest outbreaks indicated the virus could spread from personal contact, eventhe carrier didn’t have symptoms.But experts now say that while asymptomatic spread can occur, it is not the main way it’s being transmitted - and it is those who are sick that are infecting others at high rates.“We have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing,” Van Kerkhove added.“They’re following asymptomatic cases. They’re following contacts. And they’re not finding secondary transmission onward. It’s very rare.”A report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventionpublished on April  cited the “potential for presymptomatic transmission” as a reason for the importance of social distancing.“These findings also suggest that to control the pandemic, it might not be enough for only persons with symptoms to limit their contact with others because persons without symptoms might transmit infection,” the CDC study said.But more research and data are needed to “truly answer” whether coronavirus can spread widely through asymptomatic carriers, Van Kerkhove added.Experts have also issued caution over whether people with no symptoms can transmit Covid-.Prof Liam Smeeth, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “I was quite surprised by the WHO statement, and I have not seen the data the statement is based on.“There remains scientic uncertainty, but asymptomatic infection could be around  per cent to  per cent of cases.The best scientic studies to date suggest that up to half of cases became infected from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people.”Prof Keith Neal, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham, said: “How much of a role asymptomatic transmission plays in the total number of new infections remains unclear, but symptomatic people are responsible for most of the new infections of Covid-.“This reinforces the importance of any person who has any of the symptoms of Covid- arranges a test for themselves as soon as possible and isolating until they get their test result.“Everyone has a role to play in stopping Covid-.”Prof Babak Javid, a consultant in infectious diseases at Cambridge University Hospitals, said it was important to distinguish between those with very mild or no symptoms.He explained that those who never develop symptoms are known as true asymptomatics, while presymptomatics are those who don’t have symptoms at the time of testing positive for the virus but later develop symptoms and paucisymptomatics who are those who have atypical or very mild symptoms.Prof Javid said: Detailed contact tracing from Taiwan as well as the first European transmission chain in Germany suggested that true asymptomatics rarely transmit.“However, those and many other studies have found that paucisymptomatic transmission can occur, and in particular, in the German study, they found that transmission often appeared to occur before or on the day symptoms first appeared.Other data available, from studies in several continents confirming that presymptomatic transmission does occur would suggest that being well does not necessarily mean one cannot transmit SARS-CoV-.However, the important point is made that some even very mild symptoms that are not ‘typical’ of Covid i.e. not having a fever or cough may still represent someone who can be contagious.This has important implications for the track trace isolate measures being instituted in many countries.”It comes after the NHS added a loss of taste and smell to its official coronavirus symptoms list.New government guidance means anyone suffering from anosmia will have to self-isolate for seven days and their family remain indoors for .Until last month, only Brits with a new fever or persistent cough were told to quarantine and allowed to get tested.But scientists and leading experts have repeatedly criticised this narrow set of symptoms, warning it risks missing up to half of cases.Meanwhile, there have now been . million confirmed cases and almost , people have died worldwide from the disease.That includes , positive cases and , deaths in the UK.But going into lockdown prevented almost half a million deaths, according to researchers who warn that precautions are necessary to avoid a second wave.A team from Imperial College London -

The evidence is just too much and the police are looking again at my sons disappearance.He was a lovely boy, my first child and I will never get over what happened. I think of him every day and imagine what sort of man he would have been and what we would have done together.Just look at both of the children, you can see how handsome Renee is and how beautul Madeleine looks and they were almost the same age.I strongly believe both children were taken there is no doubt of it.Initially when Rene vanished in  Portuguese police said he had drowned and failed to carry out any proper searches of the sea for two days.He ran ahead during a family walk on the beach to go in the sea. After losing sight of him they never saw him again and were left with just his clothes lying on the beach.Andreas said: They were convinced he went into the water but I know in my heart he didnt. He was taken. I know it and I can feel it.An expert showed that evenhe has drowned the waves would have brought his body back but they never found him.But he would not have gone into the sea on his own and his footprints just stopped in the sand. The police investigation in Portugal was not thorough enough and I see the similarities with what happened to Madeleine.Madeleines prime suspect Christian B moved to the Algarve in  shortly after being convicted of molesting a six-year-old girl in his native Germany.The court heard he only stopped when she started screaming and he said he had felt nothing during the attack.Andreas added: The Portuguese police kept saying we dont get kidnappings here, its not a big city its a holiday destination but they were wrong. Two children were taken from there and who knows how many others.When I saw the picture of the man in prison all I could see was evil and then when his record came out and the fact he was living nearby just made me convinced he must be connected.When I think that Rene and Madeleine may have ended up in the hands of that paedophile it makes me sick. He is a convicted paedophile and always will be. Those tendencies never leave.It has brought everything flooding back for us and my poor father in law travelled back and forth to Portugal from Germany so many times to look for Rene and in the end it made him sick.We all offered to help the Portuguese police to look for Rene but all they did was shrug their shoulders and say what can you do .It comes as the German prosecutor investigating Madeleines disappearance fears Christian B may have committed more crimes against British victims.Hans Christian Wolters said he has evidence Madeleine is dead but not enough to charge Christian B.He told Sky News: “We think our suspect has done more crimes possibly against British, Irish or American people.“All these people are asked to call us so we can solve these cases.”He added: All indications we have got that I cant tell you points in the direction that Madeleine is dead.The hard evidence we don’t have, we don’t have the crucial evidence of Madeleine McCann’s body.We expect that she is dead, but we don’t have enough evidence that we can get a warrant for our suspect in Germany for the murder of Madeleine McCann.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From last Monday schools, have been encouraged to reopen for pupils in nursery, reception, primary one and primary six. But teachers unions, head teachers, and parents warned that the move was happening too quickly and schools were not ready to take pupils back. Government stats published today have revealed that around half of primary schools in England reopened to more children last week. The pupil attendance rate in nursery and primary schools was % on Thursday last week. While that figure takes into account the years that are not yet allowed back to school, it also suggests that take up among parents allowed totheir children to school is relatively low. The Department for Educationfigures show that % of education settings that normally accept at least one of these year groups were open to additional children on June . More vulnerable pupils attended school in the last week. While many have been eligible to attend school throughout the crisis alongside the children of key workers, take up of places had been low. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “It is encouraging to see the majority of primary schools open their doors to more pupils, and almost double the number of children now attending early years settings. “This is still a dficult time for families and many feel anxious about their children going back – but I can reassure families, and those working in education settings, that the welfare of children and staff will continue to be at the heart of all our decisions. “Families should also be reassured by the incredible work teachers and support staff are doing to adapt their settings and routines, while making sure schools and nurseries remain as welcoming as they have always been.” It came as Ministers were set to ditch plans for other years toto school before September.

Care minister Helen Whately did not deny the plan had been dropped. She told the BBC it was “always clear” thehad to be done “step by step” but she did not want to “pre-empt” Mr Williamson’s statement. Itaposs thought the government would still like other primary school pupils tobefore the summer holidayspossible, but not necessarily for a full month. Multiple reports today say some primary pupils wonapostuntil the autumn. It comes after schools mounted a huge backlash against the initial scheme to bring back years R,  and  from June . Hundreds of schools refused to comply with the date and said it would take them longer to reopen safely.  Schools are being told to keep each -pupil group apart from each other group. If one person in the group tests positive for coronavirus, the whole group will isolate for two weeks. Meanwhile toys are being removed, surfaces cleaned more often, break and pick-up times staggered and narrow corridors made one-way. Children who are shielding for medical reasons or classed as clinically vulnerable were exempt from coming back to school. Parents will not face fines for keeping their children at home. Downing Street had raised hopes of a climbdown last week when a spokesman said the plans to bring back all primary years by July remain under review. Anne Longfield, the Children’s Commissioner for England, said today the change in plans for primary schools was “a huge disappointment”. She told BBC Breakfast: “I think it’s a huge disappointment for those children who’d expected to go back into school before the summer now now may not. “It does mean that the vast majority, probably about eight million children, very likely won’tto the classroom until September, which means that, again, there will be a huge iation in their learning over that period.” She said children will remain “isolated”, with many living in “fragile” family environments. “I hope that Government doesn’t just write off this period,” Ms Longfield said. But the National Association of Head Teacherssaid it would be pleased to see the government will not force the impossible. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he was not surprised. He said: “The ‘ambition’ to bring back all primary year groups for a month before the end of the summer term was a case of the Government over-promising something that wasn’t deliverable. “It isn’t possible to do that while maintaining small class sizes and social bubbles, so we aren’t surprised that the policy has been jettisoned.” Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary, said: “The Government has completely failed to show leadership.

The Home Secretary reportedly had a firm conversation with Avon and Somerset chief constable Andy Marsh yesterday. She demanded an explanation as to why officers did not stop campaigners tearing down the statue of th century slave trader Edward Colston, before throwing it into the cityaposs harbour on Friday. And she made clear she wants the people who removed the statue to face criminal prosecution, according to the Times. Chief constable Marsh said that had his officers intervened to arrest those responsible there would have been a very violent confrontation. To arrest suspects would likely to lead to injuries to suspects, injuries to officers, and people who were not involved in damaging property being thrown into a very violent confrontation with the police that could have had serious ramications for the city of Bristol and beyond, Mr Marsh said. Can you imagine scenes of police in Bristol fighting with protesters who were damaging the statue of a man who is reputed to have gathered much of his fortune through the slave trade  I think there would have been very serious implications and whilst I certainly do not condone crime or damage of any sort, I fully support the actions of my officers. They responded with common sense, sound judgment and in the best interest of public safety. Patel described the incident as utterly disgraceful, while crime, policing and justice minister Kit Malthouse called for those responsible to be prosecuted.  Downing Street described the incident as a criminal act and said the democratic process should be followed.Speaking on LBC, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was completely wrong for the statue to be pulled down in that way.But he added: You canapost, in st century Britain, have a slaver on a statue - a statue is there to honour people. That statue should have been brought down propely with consent and put, I would say, in a museum. Around , people took part in the protest on Sunday, which was praised by the force for being peaceful and respectful. Mr Rees said he could not condone the damage to the statue but praised the police response. I think what weaposve seen is intelligent, wise policing thataposs avoided the kind of confrontations weaposve seen here in other cities and certainly in the US, Mr Rees said. If you just want to come out with bombastic statements, you are going to end up going down this Trumpian route, and thataposs not the kind of politics we need right now. Colstonaposs involvement in the slave trade through the British-based Royal African Company was the source of much of the money which he bestowed on Bristol. The statue was one of a number of landmarks in the city to bear Colstonaposs name, although music venue Colston Hall will be renamed this year as part of a major refurbishment. A spokesman for Historic England said the unauthorised removal of a listed structure could not be condoned, but recognised that the statue had been a symbol of injustice and a source of pain. We are here to offer guidance and support but believe the decision is best made at a local level - we do not believe it must be reinstated, he added. More than , people have signed a petition calling for a statue of Dr Paul Stephenson - who led the  Bristol Bus Boycott - to replace the Colston memorial.

YouGov compared  countriesapos approval rating among their own citizens over the handling of the pandemic and claimed the UK was joint-worst. Boris Johnsonaposs government was at a net approval rating of minus  - down from minus  in a week and equal only to Mexico, YouGov said. The Trump administration came third from bottom. Its handling of the crisis had a score of minus , down from minus  the week before. YouGov said % of Americans said the government is performing well compared to % who said it is performing poorly. YouGov lead data journalist Matthew Smith said: This means domestically, the British government are seen by the population to be handling the crisis less well than Americans think of their own government. Out of the  countries YouGov looked at, the Vietnamese government enjoyed the highest domestic approval rating of any nation at +. It was followed by Taiwan and Malaysia on +. Communist Vietnam claims to have had just  cases of coronavirus and no deaths after bringing in stringent lockdown restrictions early in the pandemic. It is also a one-party state. However, YouGov did also claim approval ratings were rising in some other Western countries as lockdown measures begin to ease. In France the net score rose from minus  last week to minus  this week, while Finland moved from + to +.  Tory ministers have repeatedly insisted it is too soon to compare the UK to other countries over coronavirus deaths. Deaths are recorded dferently in each country, and current figures do not show excess deaths compared to normal times. That means statistics are muddied by each country having its own age profile and underlying health problems.

Christine Emelone said the comment left her feeling embarrassed and completely alone, and says itaposs proof that racism is still evident in Britain. The student journalist, who worked part time at the major food chain, said that black women should be able to be in control over their hair, their wants and their lives and should not feel pressure to become something that theyaposre not. Writing for student news site The Tab, Christine said the incident took place last month. She added that she took some time off from work in the immediate aftermath but has since ed. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here Christine said: As I entered the staff room of where I work, my manager approached me abruptly before giving me a long, disdained look. He said that I could not work today because was my hairstyle was aposunprofessionalapos and aposunfit for workapos. He asked me to leave. I didnapost get paid that day. I desperately needed the money for an urgent personal issue, but I didnapost think he would understand. Colleagues came up to me asking what had happened, why I looked so glum, but I simply couldnapost find the words to say. The fact that they were working shts and I wasnapost because of my tight, kinky black coils baffled me, and the last thing I wanted was to be laughed at after I had been embarrassed by my boss. This happened at a major fast food chain - last month. Prior to this incident, I had a vivid understanding of hair discrimination, but had never actually experienced it for myself. I had never actually been in the shoes of someone who had been judged purely because of the style of their hair and its appearance. I felt completely alone. I didnapost know who to talk to. Even though it didnapost sound asit was a big deal, it was a serious issue that affected me and deeply hurt my feelings. I wondered whether it was normal, or something that usually happened that people just didnapost talk about and ignored. However, I stand confident to say that my natural, afro hair is part of who I am, and I am in no way ashamed of it. She added: Black people across the UK have been barred from jobs, schools and public events because they choose to style their hair in locks, Afros and twists. I think itaposs completely absurd and really doesnapost make sense. Why canapost people be accepted for who they are  Many black people face mounting pressure to wear their hair in a way that conforms to more European standards of beauty and spend huge amounts to chemically straighten and maintain their hair. To me, this is an important problem that needs to be addressed. Black women should not feel like they need to change their hair to conform to anything! Itaposs who they are and should not feel pressure to become something that theyaposre not. Even though more people have embraced natural hair in recent years, the stories of hair discrimination remain prevalent, echoing through the African American community and where. Christine didnapost change her hair but didto work, adding that her manager didnapost mention it when they saw her next. She added: In the UK, workplace discrimination, on the basis or race, religion or gender, is illegal in the UK.

Up to  people attended the anti-racism protest at the Clock Tower in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, which was met by opposition from a group of largely white men. Footage shows how counter-demonstrators hurled insults at the group, including one unidentied person who was clearly heard saying go back to Africa. Another highly-agitated man is also seen telling the group to shut your f****** mouths during the disruption, prompting a police officer to step in. In another clip, the group chant at the Black Lives Matter demonstrators to get their **** out for the lads, while one protester claimed to see Nazi salutes. Reports say that the counter-protest was there to aposdefendapos Hoddesdonaposs WWII monument after a Winston Churchill statue was vandalised in central London on Sunday. Hertfordshire Police said it is now taking action following the incident but did not sayany arrests have been made. Social media users have expressed their anger over the scenes and say that officers at the scene should have intervened to stop the harassment. Demi-Leigh Sheahan attended the protest and shared videos of the chants online. She told HertsLive : Personally, what I find so disgusting and frightening about these videos is, firstly, that ending racism has somehow become a controversial topic. People from Hoddesdon and surrounding areas have gone out of their way during a global pandemic to oppose the BLM protesters and with such vile and derogatory language.  Regardless whether you support the riots or not, I would find it hard to believe that you would be comfortable with a fully grown adult man shouting aposget your t**s outapos at your daughter, mother, sister, friend or even just anyone you know. Another protester said she felt that something wasnapost right as soon as she arrived on the high street and claimed to have witnesses Nazi salutes. They were saying, aposgo back to your own countryapos, aposgo back to your rockapos,aposyou’re not welcome hereapos,aposeducate yourselfapos she explained.  It comes after a statue of th century slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down and thrown into Bristol Harbour during a Black Lives Matter protest on Sunday. Today, demonstrators will protest in front of the statue of Cecil Rhodes in Oxford on Tuesday as part of the Black Lives Matter movement. It comes amid a wider decolonise movement sweeping universities across the world in recent years. Following protests across the UK on the weekend, the Prime Minister - who had previously condemned the thuggery by a minority that marred some demonstrations - acknowledged many of the activistsapos concerns were founded on a cold reality. He said leaders simply canapost ignore concerns that black, Asian and minority ethnic groups face discrimination in education, employment and in law. But the PM said those who harmed police or property would face the full force of the law.  Tottenham Hotspur football club released a statement on Twitter after the video emerged, saying: These are no fans of ours. This Club does not tolerate racist, discriminatory or hateful behaviour of any kind.We are looking into this and will take the necessary action against any so-called ‘fan’ involved.

Lina Sapia, , has beat the staggering one in  million odds by naturally conceiving the babies - something she thought wasnapost possible after needing IVF to conceive her first born Alba, one. The stay-at-home mum and her husband Fabio, , wanted to extend their family and planned on using one of the four frozen embryos but were pleasantly surprised to two lines on a pregnancy test in September . The couple were in total shock when they saw three heartbeats at their six-week scan. Lina, from Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, said: We were trying for three years before we decided to have IVF with Alba which was successful first time.  We always knew we wanted to have another baby and assumed we will need to go through IVF again after being diagnosed with unexplained infertility. I experienced a second miscarriage three months prior to discovering I was pregnant with triplets in September but I didnapost get my hopes up as I feared it may happen again. We booked in for an early scan at six weeks to check the baby was healthy and the nurse kept asking me questions such as have I been feeling sick  To which I said no but I did feel slightly bigger than before - I constantly looked bloated like I had eaten a huge plate of pasta. She went to get a second opinion and said thereaposs more than one heartbeat, so we assumed two, not three! We were in total shock and couldnapost believe it - Fabio, who is a risk analyst, was nervously laughing in the corner. We felt like we had won the lottery - neither of us have multiples in the family!  Medics prepared the couple for the worst as triplet pregnancies have a high risk of miscarriage. Thankfully, there wasnapost any complications and Lina gave birth at  weeks to Luis who weighed lb  oz, Piero,  lb oz and Remi,  lb oz. The couple admit they still get confused with who is who at times and the -week-old triplets still wear velcro wrist bands with their initial on to ensure they are not mixed up. She adds: I felt anxious throughout the pregnancy as I feared something bad may happen and I couldnapost deal with another miscarriage. But we had scans every two weeks to ensure everything was fine - it was incredible watching them grow. My bump became heavy and uncomfortable towards the end but I persevered as I still needed to be a mum to Alba and keep her entertained. They were born on March  - and thankfully our parents were able to meet them before the UK went into lockdown.  The triplets were like superstars at St Peters, Chertsey, Surrey as many of the staff hadnapost seen identical triplets before. Fabio wasnapost allowed to see them for three weeks whilst they were in hospital due to the restrictions - only via FaceTime which was dficult. The NHS were absolutely incredible for not only getting us through the pregnancy but also providing  hour care when they were born.

Student nurse Louise Kerton, from Broadstairs, Kent, was last seen in Germany in July , where she was supposed to be catching a train from the city of Aachen, near the border with Holland and Belgium, before taking a ferry to Dover. Her father Phil Kerton has never given up hope of finding out what happened to his daughter, who was then , and he is following the fresh developments in the McCann investigation closely. Mr Kerton, , said of the latest news: It just confirms that the family have been right to keep persisting, there was something to find out there.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email. Certainly the German police seemed confident they are onto something there. It gives one some sort of hope that the truth is out there to be found. Mr Kerton, of New Ash Green, Kent, added: I have sort of given up getting too excited I am afraid. We have just got to keep calm but keep the pressure on.  In a separate interview, Mr Kerton told the Sun: Christian seems to have gone after all ages, despite preferring the very young. I would urge police to make sure his whereabouts and his activities at the time of Louise’s disappearance are properly investigated.” He added: I have read that the German police are taking an interest in finding out where Christian B was in relation to unsolved cases, so I hope Louise’s gets drawn in.” He said his daughter had been really careful about travelling around and that it seemed very unlikely that she would have come to harm on a train somewhere.  Louise was a school friend of air hostess Lucie Blackman, who was found murdered in Japan in February . There is no direct evidence of anyone having seen Miss Kerton in Aachen or on the train she was due to take, nor at her intended destination of Ostend. Mr Kerton says he would love Kent Police to be involved in the latest investigationit might help shine a light on his daughteraposs case, but said he is not going to push German authorities while they are looking into what happened to Madeleine. He added: I am letting the authorises get on with investigating the Madeleine link, I do not want to distract them . Mr Kerton says he just wants them to ask about what happened to his daughter when Brueckner is questioned. Prosecutors are examining any links between the suspect and the disappearances of several children across Europe. Investigators believe there are victims of related sex crimes who have not come forward.  Police were already taking another look at the disappearances of Inga Gehricke, five, in Germany in May  and Rene Hasee, six, in Portugalaposs Algarve in June  to find outBrueckner was responsible.

The -year-old said he decided to tackle the garden to make use of his time stuck at home, but weeks quickly turned into months as he continued to add to the project. He initially took inspiration from the Mallorca based villa seen on the UK version of Love Island after wanting to incorporate its outdoor fairy lights. Roping in his children Sophia, eight, and Noah, five, to help, the makeover slowly expanded and Derry says heaposs now inundated with requests from friends and family to visit the garden on sunny days. He said: It wasnapost supposed to be as big as this, it just ended up that way because Iaposve had time on my hands as the weeks turn into months. It all started around this fire pit in the middle which we already had and it just expanded from there. It wasnapost my original idea to turn it into the Love Island villa but I did steal the idea for the lights from the show because my missus watches it and Iaposve seen them on the television and I thought they looked really nice. Now everyone tells me it looks just like the Love Island villa. Thereaposs people that I havenapost spoken to for  years from school but have been messaging me about it.  I never expected it to blow up like this, itaposs been crazy. Handyman Derry did all the manual labour himself, ordering the equipment online and using sites like Pinterest for inspiration.With foreign holidays unlikely this year, Derry also wanted to create a holiday space at home for his two children to enjoy in the warmer weather."},{"url":null,"title":"darren lewis after false dawns","story":"NewsopinionNow we can unlock shackles of institutional racism after too many  dawnsMy optimism has been crushed before but this feels dferent.

This really is the last generation prepared to live their lives bound by the shackles of institutional racism. More than that, I found myself fighting back a few emotions.Change is being demanded across every strata of our society. That brutal footage of George Floyd being killed by US police has inspired the world to declare enough is enough.  I’ve seen my optimism crushed before, of course. After the four officers who brutally beat Rodney King on film were cleared in . After the politan Police vowed to act on the Macpherson Report which declared – following the Stephen Lawrence murder – that the force was institutionally racist in , only for more black men to die in police custody. Crushed again after the Tottenham riots sparked mayhem across the country in  and calls for change were quickly forgotten. And after the footballer Raheem Sterling called out the negative depiction of black men in the media in December . Warm words followed with a few appointments in newsrooms to ease consciences – but little . This, though, feels dferent. Ordinary black people might not have the financial security of Star Wars actor John Boyega, but they are motivated by his insistence on speaking out despite fearing he’d put his career at risk.

And I recently decided to get myself tested for Covid- at a drive-through site - which turned out to be one of the strangest experiences of my le. Youaposre registered for your Covid- test, a text message reads after the online application went through. But it didnapost really feel real until I arrived at the test centre, which suddenly felt like I was in some sort of video game. Usually, the site is used as a park and ride facility, with the car parks always crammed with vehicles, but not now. As I pulled in, all I could see were people wearing hi-vis jackets or in white protective suits, and dozens of traffic cones scattered across the place. I followed the directions accordingly, and stopped as two men approached my car and asked: Are you here for the test  to which I nervously laughed and replied: yes. One man then instructed me to follow the cones around to the other side of the car park, where I would be told what to do next.  I followed it round, baffled about how quiet the site was - there was one other car in sight taking part in the testing and that was it. I approached the next stage and was greeted by another two people in hi-vis jackets, both wearing face masks. One was stood on the side, and another stood right in front of the car, and began to give instructions via laminate sheets. I was told to keep all windows closed at all times, asI was entering a safari park. The man on the side then tapped the window and asked me to show him my QR I had received as part of my appointment confirmation.  I showed it to him, through the window, of course, along with some ID which I needed to take along. Once the code was scanned and ID checked, I was then told to drive up the slope to the next checkpoint. I proceeded, slowly, the speed limit was mph. It felt like I was on some sort of roller coaster as I drove up the slope, not knowing what would be waiting for me on the other side. And then, it sunk in how big an operation this was. There were several portable buildings all lined up and plenty of gazebos setup, ready for people to be tested. I was met by a woman in a white hazard suit and a face mask, who also had some written instructions for me. I had to show my QR code once more, before being askedI wanted to carry out the test myself or for someone to do it for me. The thought of someone shoving a cotton swab down my throat was not pleasant, but I felt it would be better than me attempting it, so I opted for the trained people to do it for me. I told them, even more nervous than ever, that I would allow them to test me. The woman then went into a cabin, and ed shortly after with a clear plastic bag with swabs and tubes inside.  I quickly worked out this is what would be used to perform the test. She placed it under my windscreen wipers, and I was then told to drive to bay five. So I proceeded onwards, past several of the empty portably buildings, before my destination arrived. I pulled in very slowly, with a cabin to my left, but no sign of anyone. By now, my heart was racing and the nerves really set in. I calmly switched my car engine off and waited like I had entered a car wash. A few moments later, a man dressed in military unorm emerged from the cabin, wearing a white face mask and plastic gloves. He approached my window, which I very slowly opened. Hi there he said, before going through what would happen next. I was askedI had any bleeding from the nose or mouth or any mouth ulcers. I shook my head, before he removed the long swab from the bag and told me he would use both sides of the swab - one for the throat and one for a nostril. My immediate thoughts were how I had seen some diagrams online of how far back the swab goes down the throat, before the man said I may gag. So, I opened my mouth as wide as I could, like I was at the dentist, and was asked to say aposaaaaaahhhhapos before the swab entered my mouth and touched my tonsils.  It went on for a few seconds, as I hoped I would not gag. Thankfully I didnapost and it wasnapost as bad as those grim graphics make out. Next the swab was to be inserted up my nose. It may make you cry a little, the man said as I again chuckled nervously. It didnapost go too far up my left nostril, but boy, did it tickle, and sure enough, a tear ran down my eye. Thataposs great the man said as he placed the swab into the plastic bag and headed back inside the cabin.  He ed shortly after with a small card, which was my aposreceiptapos. Thank you for attending today and completing the test for Covid-, a message on the card read. And that was it. I rolled my window up and proceeded to follow the exit signs. I breathed a huge sigh of relief. It was done. It was such a simple process that was well managed by all involved at the test centre, but I could not help but contemplate how empty the place was. All I wanted to do now was go home, where the painful wait for the test results to come through would begin.  I was told that most people would receive their results within  hours but it could take up to five days. In fact, it was six days. Six long days, which, to be honest, I had almost forgotten that I still hadnapost received my results. But, on Saturday night, my phone buzzed as I had received a text and an email. I opened the email first, which said in capital letters: NHS COVID- NOTIFICATION. I scrolled down. Your Covid- test has come back NEGATIVE. You donapost have the virus at this time.

And, obviously, it wasnapost two-up, two-down semi - itaposs a huge mansion with lots of room for their future family. Frogmore Cottage, a th Century Grade II-listed building, sits in the grounds of Windsor Castle, and a Kensington Palace spokesman said at the time that it was a very special place for the couple.Prior to them moving in, Meghan and Harry had the whole place refurbished - costing the taxpayer £.million. Renovations on the cottage were funded through the Sovereign Grant - a sum of money given to the Monarch from the Government each year. They enlisted the help of designer Vicky Charles to turn the building into their dream home, and sheaposs believed to have helped them decorate the new nursery and yoga studio. Vicky is behind the design of the trendy Soho Farmhouse, a favourite hangout of Meghan and Harry and where Meghan is believed to have spent three days on her hen do. However, the stunning Frogmore Cottage was the subject of a huge debate after Meghan and Harry decided to quit the royal family.  Despite stepping back from their duties and saying they wanted to be privately funded, they announced they planned to keep their Windsor home as their UK base. In a statement on the Sussex Royal website, they said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to use Frogmore Cottage as their official residence as they continue to support the Monarchy, and so that their family will always have a place to call home in the United Kingdom. The announcement didnapost go down well, and they faced public backlash over their continued claim to the cottage, which subsequently emerged as a key focus of the Queenaposs aposMegxitapos negotiation deal.  Many peope felt that as theyaposre no longer working royals, they shouldnapost live in home which was refurbished at the expense of the taxpayer. Meghan and Harryaposs final quitting deal saw them offer to reimburse the taxpayer for massive renovations costs.They could also be forced to pay  hundreds of thousands of pounds in rent   they wish to continue using they home as they start their new le in LA. The Queen made it clear the outgoing Duke and Duchess of Sussex should keep Frogmore in their landmark aposabdicationapos deal because she worried they might not otherwiseto the UK, the  Mail  reported at the time. Sources told the newspaper that the Queen wanted Harry, Meghan and baby Archie to have a home in the UK to maintain the familyaposs bond. The source told the Mail: It is very telling that the Queen makes clear [in her statement] that she has given them a home on her favourite estate and that they are going to keep it. She wants them to have a family home in the UK. But they were constantly being beaten up about the cost of the Frogmore renovations. So there was no hesitation in their mind of offering to pay the money back in order to be free of any public obligations. In a statement released by the Queen after the negotiations, she said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have shared their wish to repay Sovereign Grant expenditure for the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, which will remain their UK family home. Before their wedding, the couple lived at Harryaposs old bachelor pad - Nottingham Cottage in Kensington Palace.

When the tales from a young woman who claims Epstein made her have sex with the Prince – which the Prince denies – are so disturbing you’d think he would be hammering on the FBI’s door to clear his name. So let’s end this war of words between the US Ministry of Justice and the Prince. Andrew’s lawyers insist he’s made three offers to help. Well let’s see a no-strings fourth and arrange for an interview in London. We criticise the US for shielding Anne Sacoolas, wanted in the UK over Harry Dunn’s death. The Duke must lead by example, and co-operate fully. Virus farce Quarantine is another failed policy. Forcing those arriving at airports to shut themselves away for two weeks is a blunt instrument riddled with holes. To work, this strategy should have been applied at the start of the pandemic, not now. It also makes no sense to impose this on people from countries with much lower coronavirus rates than our own.  And thirdly, allowing use of public transport, accommodation changes and shopping trips are holes big enough to fly a jumbo jet through.

The short clip shows a woman walking across a pedestrian crossing with the black and white animal on a leash, leaving a passenger in a waiting car stunned as they film the bizarre moment. The clip caused a heated debate when it was posted online - but it turns out the animal isnapost a panda at all. A man in southern Chinaaposs Leshan has dyed his dog black and white to make it look like a panda.Itaposs owner, named Yang Yan, said his Chow Chow named Mei Niu, which translates as pretty girl, already resembled a panda so he came up with the idea to dye her fur black and white using aposnatural colouringapos. Yang says he made the dye using plants and water, claiming it is harmless to the dog. Elisa Allen, director of PETA , said: Dogs are smart, complex animals, not toys. There is no safe way to dye a dog or any other animal, as there will always be risks of toxic poisoning or allergic reactions that can prove fatal to the animal. Putting a dogaposs health at risk by treating a companion animal like a novelty trinket is both unethical and unnecessary. Itaposs not the first time the dog breed has been given a makeover to look like a bear, after pet shops in China reported they were selling out of apos Panda Dogs apos.

But sheaposs said she isnapost going to tell the organisationshe goes under the kne again, saying she wants to step away from the book. Since , Cindy, who is American but now lives in London, has had  operations including three face lts, two nose jobs, implants and a chin reductions.Sheaposs had a series of other non-surgical procedures - including chemical peels and semi-permanant make-up. Cindy, who is now in her s, explained that unfortunately people see the Guinness World Record events as a freak show, and said that while all the other holders were lovely she felt she didnapost belong there.  She now hopes Rodrigo Alves, AKA the Human Ken Doll, will take her record. Speaking in , she told the Sun: I have had more work since setting my last world record, a neck lt, a few tweaks and dozens of non-surgical procedures - I can’t remember all the procedures. It’s like asking someone to remember how many haircuts they’ve had in the last  years. I won’t be officially logging them because I’m sick of being known as a Barbie doll. I don’t want to be involved in a competition. I think some people – like Rodrigo – have procedures just to win the title.“I went for the natural look. There have been claims he is addicted to surgery, I don’t know whether or not he is, but I most certainly am not - the dferences are endless. For me, surgery that isn’t as natural-looking as possible, is a failure. Speaking before her decision to step away from the world of records, she spoke about the honour of being in the famous book.She said: Everybody knows the Guinness World Record book, and when I was a child I used to find it in the news agent every year when it came out and go through it - we all did. We all looked forward to seeing what person was going to be in it. I never dreamt of being in it because didnapost come from any sort of extraordinary background.

Hopefully a few of them will.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Since I left school, I’ve been able to play football, which regardless of what level, I’ve not ‘worked’ a day in my le, until I did my adult apprenticeship.“And Raith Rovers have given me the best memories I’ve had at a football club.“I can’t go anywhere in the world # I was in Australia there in Melbourne for four months # without someone mentioning Raith Rovers to me about the goal.“I got to live my dream by scoring against Rangers as a Celtic supporter in a cup final in extra-time.“But it was because of Raith Rovers I could do that, so that connection with Raith Rovers will always be there.“You play from when you’re five, six, seven years old and you watch Scottish Cup finals on the telly.“And I’ve had the opportunity, because of this football club, to [play in a cup final].“So, when I finish, there’s something to be remembered for.“I’m a painter now and you want people to say, ‘Get John Baird, he’s a good painter’.

School ended and there was nothing to do until it was Monday.The school was going to be online – like as in online! No playing with friends, no going outside, NO EVERYTHING! Everything was a mess in my mind. Then I thought… why should I worry  All I have to do is get a device. That’s easy! I can just use my Chromebook. So all now I have to do is wait…Wait some more… And I felt excited and enthusiastic. The trouble was that there were two of us – me and my brother. However, we only had one device.Then our mum said to get the old iPad. We haven’t seen them in two years! I quickly rushed to the box that had them. Finally! Two days zoomed past, now it is Monday, the first day of online school. At first I was confused and baffled what to do, then I saw the homework. It took  minutes to find it. First thing was the Google Classroom guidance and agreement which is just accepting all the rules about online schooling.The first month there was online schooling I didn’t go anywhere, just stayed at home. I pleaded to go outside but my mum insisted no. All I wanted was some fresh air since I’ve been locked up in a cage. Finally, she let us out. It was so refreshing. My routine is breakfast, school, playing outside, additional work, dinner.We want to hear how the lockdown is affecting the youngest members of our society.

More details of the competition and the prizes on offer at the bottom of this page.To be clear, features we#ll run on the contenders for Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal, followed by a closing poll to determine the winner, won#t necessarily focus on goals of signicance which have secured silverware or qualication, like John Hewitt#s header in Gothenburg or Darren Mackie#s finish in Dnipro.What we are talking about is goals of technical brilliance, made either inidually or as a team, some of which could be meaningless in terms of competitions and silverware.This is undoubtedly the most important goal in Aberdeen#s history as it secured the club#s most famous win # over Spanish giants Real Madrid # and the most prestigious piece of silverware ever to be housed at Pittodrie.But, what some may consider a simple close-range headed finish from John Hewitt, is actually an exquisite piece of team play, well worthy of being a contender for Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal.The way Peter Weir manages to play an inch-perfect chipped ball down the left flank, despite being surrounded by Madrid players# the way Mark McGhee dips one way then the other on the edge of the box to make space to cross to Hewitt# and how the striker judges the arc of the cross as it flies beyond the keeper to head it into the empty net. It#s a beautul goal for an underdog side to score under the crippling pressure of extra-time in a European final.Current Dons chairman Dave Cormack didn#t hesitate to name it his favourite Dons goal either. He said “My all-time favourite goal, like many Dons’ fans, is John Hewitt’s header in Gothenburg when the so-called super-sub cemented our place in football history. It was a stunner of a goal and its signicance will never be under underestimated.“Another favourite was from Aberdeen legend, Joey Harper ,against Rangers in  – a half volley, typical Harper poacher goal with great build-up play from Drew Jarvie.”Harper#s goal could be on our final contenders list, but # for now # bask in the glory of Aberdeen#s greatest moment:We want youngsters to have a go at imitating our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal contenders, with the club agreeing to give away a kids# home kit and kids# away kit for the two best efforts as chosen by our  of judges. Those two winners will also receive a £ Smyths voucher each to get some football equipment, kit your garden out with a set of goals, or just spend any way you like!There will also be £ Smyths vouchers for two runners-up.All you need to do to be in with a chance of winning is to send your clip to eecompetitions@ajl via WeTransfer with the subject heading #Dons Goals#. Alternatively, you can send it to the Evening Express Sport Facebook page.All entries will feature on the Evening Express Sport Facebook page.The deadline for entries is Tuesday June  at .pm.Entrants must register by Tuesday June  at .pm.Entry to this competition is by email or through Facebook submission only.The prize is as stated.Employees of DC Thomson Ltd and immediate families may enter, but are not eligible to for any prizes.The editor’s decision is final.Full competition terms and conditions including Privacy Information at www.eveningexpress competition-termsFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

The boys and girls who qualied from the local area competitions in Lochgilphead, Oban, Tobermory and Campbeltown will be advised of the new Argyll final date and times through their local club or school.#We apologise for any inconvenience and disappointment this postponement may cause to the young athletes and their families.#The annual Crinan Puffer # an .-mile race between Crinan and Ardrishaig # has also been postponed.A fundraiser for Mid Argyll Community Pool organised with the help of Mid Argyll Athletic Club, the run was due to be held on Sunday March .Announcing the postponement, Kirsty Young of Mid Argyll Community Pool said: #In light of current government guidelines to avoid non-essential contact and unnecessary travel we feel that this is the right decision to make.#I will be contacting all stakeholders involved with the organisation and running of the event in the coming days to try and come up with a date to re-schedule the event.#Months of work to raise money for a trip to Holland in April for young Mid Argyll footballers has come to nothing, thanks to coronavirus.Lochgilphead Red Star  players, coaches, parents and supporters were left disappointed when the Amsterdam tournament was cancelled.A committee spokesperson said: #The team are devastated not to be going after nine months of fundraising for the event.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

know where your kids are and who they are with.ldquoIt is really hard for teenagers not seeing their friends for such a long time, but this virus could easily resurge and we all have to stay alert to ensure that we donrsquot get a second spike.Mrs Haslam added: ldquoThe vast majority of our young people are fantastic, sticking by the rules and engaging with their schools and communities.ldquoWe must never fall into the trap of tarring them all with the same brush.ldquoSo [a] massive shout out to all of our young people who are continuing their learning through their schools, and helping contain this virus.Mrs Haslamrsquos Tweeddale East colleague Robin Tatler recommended that constituents phone the police on they spot people breaking lockdown rules.Mr Tatler said: ldquoIt is disappointing to hear that some people in Peebles are acting in an irresponsible way during this dficult time especially as most are not.ldquoIt is important that anyone who witnesses behaviour like this or any other anti-social behaviour should report this using the  number.ldquoThere were a iety of incidents in the town over the past weekend, and I will be asking the Community Action Teams to respond to this.Police Scotlandrsquos Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said on Friday that officers would encourage compliance with the updated lockdown guidance.He said: \"We are asking people to

swim and kayak, is part of the proposals revealed by the local authority with a series of images also unveiled.The proposed ClimatEvolution Zone would cover the under-construction town of Blindwells and surroundingcommunities stretching from Prestonpans to Longniddry and inland to Tranent and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent.The first houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.\"I also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido with space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar developmentin modular manufacture and construction.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray welcomed the ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level document which sets out an ambitious vision for the area over the coming  years.He said: ldquoItrsquos an exciting opportunity to ensure that one of the key areas of East Lothian, is developed in an innovative way.\"Itrsquos not all about whatrsquos new, though.\"We are looking at enhancing the existing local

Hotels require one space per room.I understand that the parking standards have only recently come into effect and all other licensed premises have the benefit of being historical licensed premises and therefore protected. However, I fully believe that a common sense approach should have been taken in this instance, particularly as I submitted a very detailed travel plan which included not only promoting nearby parking options, bus timetables and taxis but actually incentivised travel to and from The Catrsquos Pyjamas by bus, taxi or on foot. When coming up with the concept of The Catrsquos Pyjamas in late summer early autumn  the first thing I did, being a total novice to owning a bar, was to engage with the licensing department.The licensing standards officer advised me I could operate with occasional licences whilst working toward the full premises licence so after submitting the occasional licence applications I was surprised to be told by planning I needed to submit a change of use application for the occasional licences.Bewildered by the conflicting information but just wishing to do what was required, I immediately submitted the application and paid the associated fee.It is frustrating that I was erroneously informed that a change of use was required for occasional licences which stopped me operating and establishing precedent.It is also frustrating I find myself in this situation because I accepted the advice and guidance of East Lothian Council. I am not seeking to apportion all the blame on the council as I have made mistakes, the biggest of which is being naive enough to believe that those who should have and give you the correct information actually do have and give you the correct information. What we have created at The Catrsquos Pyjamas is truly special. Those who have enjoyed an evening with us will validate that.I have had such incredible support from people across Dunbar and beyond that it continues to blow my mind. There is a real desire for The Catrsquos Pyjamas to work and given the chance it could become something truly amazing which is beneficial not only to the town but the county. But this journey has been very painful and costly.There has been a clear campaign against The Catrsquos Pyjamas to the point of it being a vendetta.Objectors have ly contacted the police to report noise when there was none ndash veried by Police Scotland ndash just to get it on the record ahead of the licensing board hearing. I need to take time to reflect on everything that has happened, to reflect on the impact that it has had on myself and my family. I need to investigate whether another location would be better orthe business model should change.At the moment all I can say is sincere thank you to everyone who has supported this venture from the outset and especially to my family for all the blood, sweat, tears and cash they have put into creating this very special place.Ross Hardie,The Catrsquos Pyjamas,Belhaven,Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"serious-car-accident-closes-major-county-road","story":"Officers from East Lothian Police are dealing with the incident, which they describe as a ldquoserious road traffic accident.The incident took place on the A.A road closure has been put in placefrom Station Road in Dirletonto North Berwick.It is not known how many cars were involved in the accident,anyone has been injured, and how long the road will remain closed."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-volunteers-aberlady-cockenzie-port-seton-gullane-prestonpans","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at fourof the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Aberlady.

They feel emotion like we do, in fact possibly more so as the emotional part of their brain is even more developed than that of humans.The old saying that ldquoan elephant never forgets is rooted in this fact. An elephantrsquos emotional intelligence comes from its ability to remember and recall distant memory. Like humans, an elephantrsquos way of being is mostly learned in early le, rather than just based on instinct.They are therefore highly sensitive creatures, influenced and affected by what they experience just as we are.Irsquove heard dferent versions of this tale, and here I have peppered it very slightly with my own style:Once, a king in ancient India owned an elephant. This royal elephant was the joy not just of the king, but also his people.The trainer would ride the elephant every day along the streets. She was a magnicent sight, and children would run out to wave and watch the elephant go by. The trainer took a dferent route each day so people in dferent neighbourhoods all had a chance to enjoy the spectacle.The people felt a real love and affinity for the elephant. Despite her size and strength, she was gentle and affectionate with the people. She would pat children carefully on their heads with her trunk and took care in where she walked.The elephant made people feel safe. More than once she had saved a child from drowning in the nearby river, or from a predator from the jungle. She was a sacred animal to the people.But then people began to notice a change in the elephantrsquos behaviour. She became aggressive and unpredictable. Instead of being patient with the children she knocked them out of her way with her trunk. Instead of being careful where she walked, she deliberately trampled on peoplersquos gardens.The trainer tried his best to control the elephant, but she seemed like a dferent animal. He couldnrsquot understand why she was behaving so dferently.It just got worse, until one day the elephant suddenly set off on a charge and rampaged through the streets, trumpeting loudly as she charged at the terried people, almost killing some of them.The king was horried and ordered the elephant to be confined to her stables. With dficulty she was finally brought under control and locked in.ldquoWhat is going on  asked the king to the trainer.ldquoI have no idea your majesty he replied, ldquoitrsquos asshe is a dferent elephant.ldquoPerhaps the elephant is ill in some way  suggested one of the kingrsquos advisors. But the vet found nothing physically wrong.Then the trainer suggested asking an old man who lived in the jungle as ldquohe is known for his wisdom in understanding animals, perhaps he will know what the cause of this is.So the king sent a messenger and the old man came to the royal palace.ldquoCan you help  asked the king.The old man asked to be left alone with the elephant for a while.When he ed he looked at the king and said: ldquoWhatever is wrong is something that cannot be seen. I must spend some time with the elephant to understand what is troubling her.And so the old man decided to watch over the elephant that night. He smeared himself in mud to mask his scent and hid in a corner of the stable.It was late evening when he heard voices.A group of men had entered the stables from a small side door. They were a gang of murderers. They were using the royal elephant stable as a place to meet and plan their activities. And in so doing they recounted stories of their deeds.Their leader was a man with a cold and ruthless heart. He told stories about his le and deeds, of how hersquod murdered and tortured people he didnrsquot like. Members of his gang laughed and shared their tales too, likewise full of hatred and cruelty.The elephant slumbered as these tales were told, but they were unknowingly heard by her. When the elephant woke the following morning, the tales of hate and violence still swirled in her mind.The old man went to the king.ldquoYour majesty, there are two things you must do to cure the elephant.ldquoThe first is to remove the murderers who meet in the stables at night. The second is you must find the kindest people, who live their lives with love and understanding. Then ask them to meet at night in the stable as the elephant sleeps and tell each other stories from their lives tales of love and understanding. If you do this, then the elephant will be cured.The king looked bemused.ldquoI will most certainly remove the murderers, he said, ldquobut are you saying that stories will cure the elephant ldquoYes, your majesty, replied the old man, ldquobut the right stories. You see we are made from the stories we hear.He went on: ldquoIf we constantly hear tales of hatred and violence then those stories paint our vision of le with fear, loathing and cruelty.ldquoButwe mostly hear tales of love and understanding, then our mind is coloured with kindness for others, and for ourselves.ldquoWe are affected by the stories we hear, evenwe donrsquot realise we have been listening to them.ldquoYour elephant was unknowingly listening to tales of hatred and killing every night as she slept. So her mind was filled with hate and distrust her vision of the world changed and so did her behaviour.ldquoIf she hears good stories then she will eventually become her kind self again.The king nodded in understanding and agreed to act on this. Within a few weeks the elephantrsquos behaviour had changed for the better.ldquoYou are indeed wise in the ways of elephants, the king said to the old man.ldquoThe truth in this is not just for elephants, the old man replied.ldquoPeople are like your elephant the stories they hear will paint their world and affect how they live in it.The king nodded once again.ldquoMy job is done, said the old man, ldquoI will nowto the forest.ldquoBy the way, your elephant will have a calf, and her calf must hear good stories too.ldquoHow can I pay you for your wisdom  asked the king.The old man thought for a moment, then said: ldquoBe a king who tells good stories tales of kindness and understanding. And be a good listener to the stories told by your people.ldquoThen you will be a truly great leader and your kingdom will flourish and be a happier place.ldquoIf you do that, it will be my greatest reward."},{"url":null,"title":"strawberry-moon-2020-time-see-skies-uk","story":"The Strawberry Moon coincideswith summer solstice once every  years when the moon is situated on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun - whichfully illuminates its round shape.Unfortunately, despite its fruity name, the moon may notappear in warm colours as we would expect.The lunar event got its name fromNative American tribes, who used the moon to help them indicate when fruit would be ripened.What does NASA say about the Strawberry Moon As described by NASA: ldquoThe Maine Farmers Almanac first published Indian names for the full moons in the s.ldquoAccording to this almanac, the full moon in June or the last full Moon of spring is known as the Strawberry Moon, a name universal to just about every Algonquin tribe.ldquoThe name comes from the relatively short season for harvesting strawberries in northeastern North America.The Strawberry Moon has also been referred to as the Hot Moon.So, when can I see it You can expect to see the spectacular lunar event at about .pm BST tonight .According to the Royal Greenwich Observatory in London, the Strawberry Moon will last for up to three orfour days."},{"url":null,"title":"black-lives-matter-donate-help-get-diverse-books-primary-schools","story":"The fund -which has raised over pound, since it was created on Wednesday, June  - aims to help black, Asian and minority ethnicstudents to feel represented by their school libraries.The initiative was inspired by protests that have taken place across the world calling for justice after the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May .Who created the fund Scott Emmons, who created the fund, told the PA news agency:ldquoTherersquos a lack of books in primary schools where not only can teachers teach the white students about these issues, but also the BAME students are severely under-represented in the books that they have.\"Mr Emmons, , who lives in Wanstead, added: ldquoI went to the protest on Wednesday in Hyde Park and came away feeling so energised.

The First Minister has taken control of the management of the pandemic in Scotland. She has stated on many occasions that she takes the decisions and the responsibility and she has fronted every daily press conference, a feat of stamina and leadership that is admirable in itself. Butthe ldquoelite has failed, so has the First Minister.Its not aswe were not warned. There were at least four reports, three specically for the Scottish Government, that told of lack or equipment and processes to handle a pandemic, but it appears that the warnings were ignored, and the necessary preparations were never made. It is also obvious that the UK did not lock down quickly enough, but the first signicant outbreak was in Edinburgh and it was covered up by the First Minister. Had it been known to the public, pressure for an earlier lockdown would have been likely. Instead concerts and sporting events were allowed to continue, including the Scotland-France rugby on March . The Old Firm game of March  was cancelled by the SPFL, not the Scottish Government. BBC Scotlands Disclosure programme calculated that a two-week delay could have cost , Scottish lives over the following month.The lack of preparedness and delayed lockdown affected the UK and the devolved administrations in equal measure, resulting in lack of PPE, hospital beds, ventilators and other necessary equipment. The urging of the WHO to ldquotest, test, test was ignored in Scotland as much as England, and current testing levels are lower in Scotland. Infections are at the same rate in Scotland. The death rate from the virus is the same. Excess deaths are the same. Deaths in care homes are slightly worseanything. Discharging potentially infected people, and therefore the virus, from hospitals into care homes is the same. There is the same callousness in refusing to move the elderly sick from care homes to hospital. The result in all of the UK has been more infections and extra deaths.A good comparator of success or failure is New Zealand, with the same population as Scotland but with  deaths compared to our ,. It is dficult to see how such breath-taking levels of incompetence bolster any case for ldquoindependence except with those obsessed with it in the first place. Andthe failure of an ldquoelite is the cause, as Mr McKenna suggests, then the Tory elite in Westminster and the SNP elite in Holyrood would seem to be more or less equally culpable.Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, North Ayrshire Council, Largs.READING Kevin McKennas column on Saturday made me wonder: able writer for your paper that he is, does he ever read your paper Your front-page lead story in the very same editionhad already demolished his assertions. Tom Gordonrsquos compelling exposures showed that the Scottish Governmentrsquos suppression of information Scottish people are entitled to know, as well as the damaging untruths we had been fed, are a cause for great concern.The fact that an incompetent elite in charge of the Covid- virus in London is leading to lack of trust, hardly confirms that similar ldquoelites are not mishandling the crisis where.Your revelation that the Scottish Government shared the Iris Report in February  with the UK Governmentshowed that both Tory and SNP Governments are jointly culpable of a disastrous lack of preparations for a pandemic that was predictable and predicted. You rightly report the view that ldquoalarm bells were ringing for both the Scottish and UK governments. Surely objective readers have concluded that both administrations failed catastrophically, resulting in a huge number of lives being lost.Elsewhere in the same edition the impact on Scottish education was exposed in David Bolrsquos coruscating article headed ldquoPupils have been left severely traumatised\". Again an indication that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos handling of these matters is no better than Boris Johnsonrsquos.Moreover, Saturdayrsquos Herald was not a one-off. Switching scores of frail elderly patients from hospitals into care homes, without their or their familiesrsquo agreement, is surely beyond defending far less a case for independence.The consequences of the Nike Conference in Edinburgh and the cover-up which followed will not go away.Boris Johnsonrsquos appalling handling of the Dominic Cummings affair remains without justication. But anyone who followed Ms Sturgeonrsquos attempts, for a whole day, to seek to retain her hapless adviser, until her own career was clearly in jeopardy, will hardly be convinced that the First Ministerrsquos motivation was at all laudable.Mr McKennarsquos repeated description of the many who disagree with separatism as ldquoUnionists is offensive to those who understand its connotations. The clear majority of Scots ndash amounting to an almost  per cent majority ndash to reject the ldquoonce in a letime choice should not have their views distorted. We choose to love our country, Scotland, and to work with others in the United Kingdom to achieve a better society and continue to hold to account an ldquoelite ldquowhether it exists in Holyrood or Westminster.Lest I am thought to be over-critical of Kevin McKenna, I welcomed his recollection that a Labour leader, Clement Attlee saved Britain, including Scotland, from the horrors of fascism by rejecting Lord Halax. I imagine Sir Starmer would agree wholly with that,not the rest of the article.Tom Clarke, Coatbridge.TOM Gordonrsquos exposeacute lays bare the damage being done to the relationship between the people of Scotland and those who govern us.His revelation that almost , patients have acquired Covid- and more than  have died after being admitted to hospital for other conditions is deplorable. But the attempt by Jeane Freeman, the Health Secretary, to appear to camouflage this and to speak instead of  ldquoincidents of Covid- on other wards is despicable.AC Grayling has previously written that ldquoin the related arts of politics and government, judicious economies with truth are a stock in trade, and the learned philosopher may well be right, but onlywe let them get away with it.When dealing with the impact of this pandemic, we need our leaders to tell us in plain language exactly how it is, no matter how bad. If they do not, and others have to speak truth to power, then our government has failed us.Bob Scott, Drymen.AN active No campaigner in  I now find myself unable to bear the thought of being subjected to a future of relentless mis-governance by such second-rate politicians as make up the current Westminster Cabinet.On the other hand, my principal concern about independence has always been the impact of the inevitable financial turmoil on those in poverty and otherwise deprived and powerless after a decade of Conservative austerity. The Yes SNP Green coalition has been unwilling to acknowledge, far less address, that issue.And so I believe that the Government and people of Scotland must find a way of addressing the issue of how we can deal with the consequences of being part of the Dystopian DysUnited Kingdomwith its architectsrsquo rejection of the UK values its citizens once believed were at least implied in its unwritten constitution.I find myself thinking that a resounding vote for an SNP Green alliance next year with a correspondingly overwhelming rejection of Jackson Carlawrsquos Conservatives would be the only way to put the necessary shot over the bows of the DDUK. A risky strategy for a non-nationalist  Probably, but presently I see no alternative when faced with a Government determined to create an ldquoindependent England founded on closer ties with a Trumpian United States.John Milne, Uddingston.THE political consequences of Brexit have so far been more rapid and lethal than its economic damage, leaving Britain with a Gilbert-and-Sullivan style leadership of spectacular incompetence during one of the worst public health crises in recent history.Out of , excess deaths, , could have been avoided had we acted like any other European and East Asian nation. On a single day last week,  people died from coronavirus in the UK ndash more than in all  EU countries over the same  hours.North and south of the Border, as government failures multiply, the default position is evasion and denial. In the past it didnt really matter who was nominally running the country as we had one of the worldrsquos most effective administrative machine.Today a weak, politicised civil service outsources to incompetent companies while co-ordinating existing organisations, such as NHS laboratories or local public health departments, is far beyond an organisation which is afraid to speak truth to power.Rev Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.AM I the only one noticing the disparities between how the UK Government deals with the EU trade deal talks compared to those with the US There seems to be no real will to engage with the EU: accusations of truculence and blocking deals are branded on both sides. Time is running out, yet there seems no political will on the side of the UK to extend the talks despite the Covid crisis.On the other hand, trade talks with the US are going swimmingly: the firm promise of Boris Johnson not to open the UK market to chlorinated chicken has already been broken hormone-fed beef will no doubt follow.

So both in my role as Commissioner and as a member of the public, Irsquove been considering how public authorities have adapted their approach to sharing information of all kinds since the impact of this pandemic began to be felt ndash and how they will do so in weeks and months ahead.Inevitably we all have questions about the decisions being made by our leaders and public services, and never more so than at a time when those decisions, sadly, may mean the dference between le and death. This is why it is so vital that Scotlandrsquos law ensures everyone has a right to seek information from public authorities, and ndash with only very few, limited exceptions ndash to receive it.For some public authorities, changes brought about by the current disruptions will make this challenging . However, not all will be impacted by the pandemic in the same way, and every authority must continue to respond to FOI requests promptly, and in any event within the  working day timeline.The Scottish Parliament has, however, acknowledged the challenges faced by authorities and has accepted that sometimes, even when responding promptly, it will not be possible to meet this timeline. The current emergency legislation therefore allows me, in certain circumstances relating to the pandemic, to decide that an authority has not breached the law evenit has failed to respond to a request within  working days. I have issued detailed guidance on the emergency changes to FOI law on my website, and will continue to enforce these provisions firmly and fairly.Crucially, FOI law also places a duty on public authorities to publish information about the work they do, the decisions they take and the services they provide ndash in a proactive way and not just when requested. This duty remains unchanged but is more important now than ever.Since we are all coming to accept that the disruption caused by the pandemic will continue for some time, I hope and expect that public authorities in Scotland will respond by adapting their ways of working, learning from this challenge, and updating their practices to ensure that people can easily access the information that matters to them ndash during this dficult time and beyond.By publishing key information proactively, clearly and speedily, authorities can both reduce the time they spend responding to requests for information later, and promote the transparent culture we all want and expect in our public services.The importance of this point was clearly highlighted by MSPs in the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Public Audit and Post-Legislative Scrutiny Committee last month, in their report on the current state of FOI law. Although the Committeersquos report was agreed before the outbreak of Covid- in Scotland, many of their recommendations highlight the real opportunities we have not only to maintain, but to improve, access to information for people in Scotland, and I look forward to helping them become a reality.Ultimately, we ndash citizens, public authorities and regulators ndash are in this together. In the face of all the disruption and uncertainty we are living through, we have a chance to change the way we understand and interact with one another about key decisions and services for the better. I hope and believe that with some determination, hard work and open dialogue, we can make a real dference.Daren Fitzhenry is Scottish Information Commissioner.

And to be fair to Mr Blair, who had only just become Prime Minister, the terms of the settlement were largely set by the negotiations during Margaret Thatcherrsquos time in government which were initially led by Sir Edward Heath, with his stellar record of undermining UK interests.

But itrsquos not just a question of it being the right thing to do it would very obviously be in the countryrsquos best interests.One result of Brexit is that opposition to immigration has fallen: according to some surveys, from about  per cent a decade ago to about  per cent now. Though I regret the end of free movement with the EU countries, it at least has the consequence that the UK can control immigration. That shouldnrsquot mean limiting it on the contrary, it should allow us to open our borders to necessary workers, and the best talent from anywhere in the world.The current population of Hong Kong, one of the wealthiest and healthiest on the planet, looks a particularly attractive prospect. But itrsquos no accident that a lump of rock in the Pearl River Delta, with no advantages other than a good natural harbour, should have become so successful.Hong Kong exists because of trade. Any place without natural resourcescan only survive through trade. As Tai-Pan, James Clavellrsquos fictionalised version of its origins, depicts it, that was initially smuggling, piracy, tea and opium.What a boon its industrious and inventive population would be to our economy. But we should go further. There is the opportunity not only to accommodate the people of Hong Kong, but to replicate the conditions that made it so successful.The obvious thing to do is to set up some new jurisdiction within the UK, but modelled on Cowperthwaitersquos principles: the Isle of Man, Gibraltar and the Channel Islands are already precedents for such a distinction. A low-tax freeport and financial centre right on our doorstep would have obvious benefits for the rest of the country, while,it were very lightly regulated, it would create housing and employment opportunities not just for immigrants, but for UK citizens.It could potentially create exactly the sort of major, galvanising transformation of the economy that would lt us out of the recession that is certain to follow our current crisis, and to provide a shot in the arm and signal of intent that ought to follow our departure from the EU. The fact that the EU would hate the idea might also be a useful point in trade negotiations.Whatrsquos more,located in the right sort of area, it could realign the whole country, balancing the disproportionate dominance of London. Ideally, for trading reasons, it should be on the coast and near a major airport. For unionist reasons, but also in the interests of geographical spread of wealth from London towards the north and west in general, it would be particularly goodit were located in Scotland.You wouldnrsquot need much space: Hong Kong island is only about  sq km, and the new free city could start off quite a bit smaller. A modest start would be to transform Millport into something more along the lines of Singapore, exempting it from UK and Scottish taxes.

Perhaps this might now be an appropriate time to consider that proposal again.I do wonder, however,the recent \"renaming\" of Cochrane Street might have been an error.As most will realise, Glasgowrsquos street plan recognises many of the events and personalities involved in the Napoleonic Wars.Is it possible that Cochrane Street recognises one of Scotlandrsquos most iconic military figures from that era Admiral Cochraneis still revered in much of South America for his later role in ending European colonialism on that continent.If this is the case, it would be a shame to lose that link to a man who made, within the context of the era in which he lived, a positive and sometimes radical contribution to the World as we now know it.In the meantime, maybe the establishment of the memorial to the Unknown Slave might be just the beginning of this generation of the city recognising and understanding the dark role that the horric and inhuman institution of human slavery has had and still has on Glasgowrsquos growth and success.Ian Graham, Erskine.I WAS saddened to see the word \"racist\" being used in connection with Scotlandrsquos police force.It made me think: who are our police officers They are our neighbours, our friends, our families, the people we socialise with. In short they are a reflection of our Scottish society.So is Scotland racist I imagine there is not a country in the world that is free of racism and as such Scotland equally has its problems. However, Scotland is also a very welcoming country and over the years we have seen people from many erse countries come and make their homes here. My own ancestry is with the Irish migration which arrived here in the mid th century. Growing up in the west of Scotland  years later was not always the easiest thing to do.We are a erse country but not as erse as many. Many of the aspects of our lives are still not reflective of that ersity. These include politics, government, the police, the fire service, sport and on and on. Governments of every colour have sought to address that problem and although progress has been made, there is still a long way to go.So back to my original point about racism in the police. That is no more true than recognising that there is racism in Scotland.In recognising that, we must work towards education and the emphasis on the very real positives that ersity offers.George Kay, Burntisland.BLACK Lives Matter protests, many of which have not limited numbers enough to make social distancing possible, are likely to cost many times more lives ndash and mostly black ones ndash than all the killings of black people by police in the last  years. How is spreading a virus, so it kills thousands more people before effective treatments or a vaccine have been found, valuing anyonersquos le While there is certainly still lots of racism on both sides of the Atlantic, those who say ldquothey would never have done that to a white guy are wrong. Only eight per cent of the people who die in police custody in the UK are black. Almost half of people shot dead by police in the US are white.Yes, more black people are killed relative to their percentage of the population crime is commoner, and racism. But there are cases of US police murdering white people almost identical to George Floydrsquos. Tony Timpa, a schizophrenic white man phoned  asking for help because hersquod come off his medication. Police arrived, forced him face down, and knelt, laughing, on his neck and back, as he said ldquoyoursquore going to kill me, for  minutes till he died. Charges brought against the three police were dropped despite video evidence.Daniel Shaver, also white, was unarmed in a hallway, with video of a police officer alternately shouting ldquoget on the floor, hands down and ldquohands in the air then shooting him dead. The officer was found not guilty of murder, and given a , annual pension for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder .Black Lives Matter protesters could get much wider support by creating a movement against police brutality and impunity against all victims, of whatever skin colour. And the assumption that police are always ldquothe good guys which allows the worst to get off with murder.Duncan McFarlane, Carluke.REFERENCE to the demonstrators on Glasgow Green and attempts at social distancing recalled a little of why I am proud to be a Glaswegian. On the other hand, television pictures of thugs throwing bicycles, bricks and fireworks at the police made me reflect on history and how easy it is to point the finger at dubious norms in the past whilst refusing to accept that we today are forming the history of tomorrow.Our concern at the pollution of the planet seems to have been overcome by our desire to get on a plane for a holiday, instead of taking the opportunity to make signicant changes. Our rightful concern to tackle the apparent health disadvantage of black people to Covid-, doesnt seem to stretch to the disadvantaged in the east end of our cities, where an address means a restricted choice of job applications and a lower expectation of le.If we really care and want to avoid future criticism, then surely, we must speak out against our actions by default in Yemen and Syria we must accept a lowering of our living standards to ensure others enjoy our benefits and surely we must consider repaying an equivalent to the ill-gained fortune on which many of our cities were built accepting a standstill in economic progress until the Third World catches up, and abandon the fashion business, social media and \"keeping up with the Joneses\" until a more equitable society is achieved.Japan after the tsunami was a great example where  per cent voted to abolish the nuclear power programme and go back to other means of production, until prices went up and % then voted to bring back nuclear power. There is an old saying about putting your money where your mouth is.James Watson, Dunbar.I ALONG with many others, no doubt, am incandescent that the marches which took place over the weekend were allowed to go ahead.What was the Government thinking of  This makes it clearer than ever that there is one law for the majority and another for a vocerous minority. We are all horried at the death of George Floyd but this is no way to honour him or support the Black Lives Matter movement. Why have those participating in country-wide marches been allowed to put the safety of the rest of the population at risk at a time we are assured when we are still in danger from the virus If there is a second wave of the virus I will have no dficulty in knowing who to blame ndash the marchers. How dare they at a time of national crisis Let us also remember that the situation in the United States regarding the status of black people is very dferent from that in the UK. There is a dferent history there no matter what the British involvement in slavery in the past.

The Silver-washed Fritillary and White Admiral, classic butterflies of summer woodland in southern Britain, were both seen on May , two weeks earlier than usual.The rare Large Blue, successfully reintroduced to Britain in the s, made its earliest ever appearance this year.Dr Fox said that while a trend of early emergences was a cause for concern, some butterfly populations were able to adapt.A lack of rainfall since February, he said, could be a greater concern for some of the insects, as vegetation was parched, leaving caterpillars to starve.He said: ldquoButterflies are able to adjust their emergence dates to suit the vagaries of the UK weather, indeed they need to do so to remain in sync with the plants that their caterpillars need to feed on.ldquoHowever, the trend towards earlier emergence of butterflies and moths in Britain over recent decades in response to climate change isnrsquot necessarily beneficial.ldquoRecent research shows that emerging earlier leads to larger populations of species that have more than one generation each year. In such species, the earlier emergence of the first generation leads to greater abundance in the second brood.ldquoHowever, for species that only have one generation each year, this positive effect on numbers was not found. Indeed, for some, more specialised species, there was a negative impact -- earlier emergence led to reduce population size.ldquoProlonged dry weather is likely to be worse for butterflies that live in open habitats with thin soils, such as chalk downland. The Duke of Burgundy butterfly, for example, lays its eggs on the leaves of cowslips and primroses, which quickly become desiccated in dry weather.The figures come ahead of Butterfly Conservationrsquos Big Butterfly Count, the largest citizen science project in the UK, which last year saw more than , people take part.Dr Fox added: ldquoThis year will be particularly interesting. We will be looking to seespecies that emerged early and have their second generation during the Count do particularly well, and whether single-generation species, such as Marbled White, are still about in July for all of our Big Butterfly Count participants to record.ldquoAll of this helps us to lsquotake the pulse of naturersquo and understand the effects of climate change and human impacts on the health of our wildle.Although many butterflies tend to appear in Scotland up to a month later than they do in England, the insects were also recorded much earlier than usual north of the Border.The Big Butterfly Count runs between July  and August ."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11460353.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ministers-told-step-plate-scotlands-environment","story":"The Scottish Environment LINKcoalition of more than  leading charities remains concerned that not enough is being done to protect the nationrsquos natural environment, wildle and air and water quality are safeguarded as the UK quits Europe at the end of the year.And it has said that Scotland can move into a post-Covid economic recovery by going green, acting ethically and helping to save the planet from climate change while protecting Scotlands world-renowned landscape and species.It believes Scotland has the opportunity to become a \"circular economy\" which makes manufacturers responsible for what happens to the goods they produce, reducing waste to curb the disposable society and protect our environment.A wide-ranging survey carried out for SEL shows some three in four agree that the government should wherever possible only allow materials that are practicably and safely recycled to be sold in Scotland.Some % agreed with the statement that \"in Scotland we should use raw materials more wisely and waste less\".People also think that the Government should take an active role in the reduction of our demands on raw materials with over three in four agreeing with the statement that it should \"introduce a target and a plan on how to reduce the amount of raw materials used\".The Scottish government has set itself a legally-binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by , five years ahead of the date set for the UK as a whole.Phoebe Cochrane, circular economy lead for SEL said: ldquoThe Scottish government must ensure we put the circular economy at the heart of our post COVID- recovery measures rather than supporting practices that lock us into a linear, polluting and unsustainable economy.Eighty percent of respondents supported a ban on all environmentally harmful single-use items where there are practical re-usable alternatives.People also think that businesses should be more responsible, with % agreeing they should have a responsibility for the environmental impact of their products. While % agree that supermarkets should report publicly on their waste and % believed they should also report publicly on the waste from their supply chains.It comes as part of the SELs Fight for Scotlands Nature campaign which is seeking the Scottish Government to produce stronger policies to protect our environment as Brexit is concluded.Among their concerns has been a method to replace the European Commissions LIFE-Nature Fund which has given pound million over  years to Scotland to help with more than  vital conservation projects protecting the countrys at-risk wildle and landscape.They previously warned the losers would include a bid to stop Scotlands red squirrels from becoming extinct, as well as moves to protect the hen harrier, harbour porpoise and the corncrake, one of Scotlands rarest birds.LIFE has also helped preserve some of Scotlands treasured landscape because of their European importance.Receiving support was the restoration of the Flow Country peatlands in Caithness, one of the last great wildernesses in the UK and the preservation of primeval Celtic rainforest, the native Caledonian pinewoods and Scotlands coastal meadows, called machair.The  Global Resource Outlook shows that extracting and processing raw materials from fossil fuels and mining to food and biofuels is responsible for half the worldrsquos carbon emissions and % of bioersity loss.The consumption of natural resources, which has tripled since the rsquos, is set to further double by .SEL said: \"We are consuming far more than our fair share andeveryone lived like us, we would need about three Earths to sustain ourselves, according to ecological footprint data.\"The coalition urged government to \"be bold\" in supporting a circular economy as part of the recovery saying: \"The public want a less wasteful economy with lighter demands on the planet where products are easy to repair and businesses are responsible.\"Prior to the recent abrupt downturn in economic activity, our economy was eating its way through the worldrsquos natural resources at a rate that was both environmentally unsustainable and undesirable from an economic resilience point of view.Currently our economy is wasteful ndash we generally grow or extract raw materials, make products, use them and then, at the end of their le, discard them. We need to re-programme our economy to extract less from the planet, reuse what wersquove already taken and reduce our waste.\"People are frustrated with the way that products are made and how it is often dficult and costly to get things repaired.\"Their survey, carried out by Survation showed that % agreed that when possible, products should be made so that they are easy to repair and their components can be re-used.They also think that everyone having access to repair services is important and the Government should be proactive, with % agreeing that ministers should make sure that people have access to repair and re-use services as well as recycling services.And % agree ministers should use available powers to encourage companies to make products sold in Scotland repairable and re-useable.Matthew Crighton, convener of SELs economics group said: ldquoThe coronavirus crisis has brought into sharp focus, for us all, the importance of our natural environment and how much we depend on it for our wellbeing. A move towards a circular economy is pivotal in meeting our climate change obligations and ensuring a resilient economy for the greater good.\"Trade unionists are also suggesing that a new \"industrial revolution\" can go green with the help of a new Future Jobs Fund to help the unemployed and a publicly owned ethical construction company.The Scottish Trades Union Congress has revealed it wants to see the fund back a construction and \"deep\" retrofit housing programme, to make existing homes more environmentally friendly, while creating \"good quality\" jobs and driving decarbonisation of heat, reducing emissions and fuel bills."},{"url":null,"title":"without-slavery-glasgow-wouldnt-exist-brutal-truth-scotlands-slaving-past","story":"Glasgow is celebrated for its art, academia and song, its multiculturalism and its warmth but scrape that surface and youll find a dferent story lurking beneath.It is a tale of people, considered to be only partially human, stolen from their lands and trafficked across the seas to labour camps, the profits of which were used to build the Glasgow we know today.This brutal history is one that the Coalition for Racial Equality and Rightsis campaigning to have included in the Scottish Curriculum and memorialised in a museum of Empire, Slavery and Colonialism.CRER organises Black History Month, an annual event that counters the hidden histories of African, Caribbean and Asian people in Scotland.: Calls for anti-racist education to be taught in Scottish schoolsThroughout October they held a Sunday walking tour around Glasgows city centre and its mercantile past, examining its sinister entanglement with the Transatlantic slave trade.At the David Livingstone statue in Cathedral Square, guides Anabelle Njenga and Yvonne Blake point out the friezes that encircle the celebrated adventurer and missionary credited for converting many African countries to Christianity. In one, an enslaved man is whipped by another man wearing a turban - an attempt at whitewashing the extent of Scotlands involvement while pointing a bloody finger at middle eastern and north African slave traders.The propagandist statue was built to distance Glasgow from its slaving past - here was a Scot who not only discovered the continent but saved Africans through Christianity in the process, so the story goes. Except, he had a \"tour guide\" says Ms Njenga, who cleared the explorers path through the undergrowth, as seen on the statue. \"He discovered nothing.\"Its vital to be clear-eyed about this history, she says. There lies real threat in \"the lingering stereotypes that the conditions of slavery were better than living in Africa\".In the th century, Scotland saw the grotesque wealth England was amassing as a result of the triangular slave trade - enslaved people exchanged for goods then sold into servitude and their crops ed to be traded.Scots were so well regarded for their cruelty they were in high demand to run plantations where the average survival rate for enslaved people was three to five years, they were worked so hard.The proximity of tobacco merchants Andrew Buchanan and Richard Oswalds graves to the Cathedral - one directly outside the entrance, the other in the nave - show exactly how much clout they held in the city. These men, and the others like them, wielded political power, Buchanan as Lord Provost and Oswald, as one of the brokers of s Treaty of Paris.:Every Scottish street linked to slave-trade revealed - find your addressDespite media publications at the time of Abolition in  professing that \"not one brick of Glasgow\" was built on the broken backs of enslaved people, the history books beg to dfer.A sum of pound million, or pound billion in todayrsquos money, was paid to the slavers - despite their offensive wealth - to compensate for lost trade. A tax only paid off in  by all of us.Ms Blake says she balks when she hears the citys slogan, Let Glasgow Flourish.She said: \"Let Glasgow flourish on the children thrown as bait to the crocodiles, on the women being raped and torn away from their breastfeeding children. When people say there were not involved, they were involved. They were involved up to their neck.\"It was not only the wealthy merchants the streets are named after, Ingram, Glassford, Buchanan and Dundas, who were culpable, but the Glaswegians who worked in administrative roles and processed the tobacco and sugar that passed through.: Boris Johnson does not believe UK is lsquoracist countryrsquoThe city had a \"disproportionate\" involvement with the slave economies, despite its calculated cover up.The Stirling family who held the estates of Keir, near Dunblane and Cadder, in the north of Glasgow hastily changed their family crest post abolition, removing the silhouette of a Black mans head signying their trade and replacing it with a gleaming white swan, as can be seen in the stained glass windows of the Cathedral.The main thoroughfares built by merchants so they could have comfortable passage from their palatial homes to the counting rooms that totted up their wealth, the parks built as play areas for their wives and children and the commercial buildings rising from the piles of bodies of enslaved Africans are all a legacy of Glasgow, and Scotlands, heavy involvement in the slave trade.It is a history that needs to be remembered, argue Ms Blake and Ms Njenga. Particularly in a cultural climate that is leaning to the right and elevating politicians and commentators that trade in racism, hatred and misogyny.Ms Blake said: \"Slavery is not in the past because even today people are benefitting from it.\"If this history was known a lot of stereotypes would not be as strong. These stereotypes are harmful to everybody\"After visiting the site of the Tontine Heads, where sugar was traded, the Old College, Glasgow Universitys first incarnation, and the Merchant City area, the tour comes to a close outside the Gallery of Modern Art, built as an extension to sugar and tobacco trader William Cunninghames mansion.Ms Njenga said: \"Glasgow used to be  streets but because of the wealth of the slave traders it expanded.

We are rightly proud in the Northern Isles of having some of the highest standards of produce in the world. Farmers and consumers alike deserve peace of mind about fair standards and fair prices for the food we produce and eat.He continued: “I am astonished that the government has leapt directly from denying earlier this year that lower food standards would be permitted to defending this policy turn wholeheartedly. Undercutting farmers and crofters is not what was promised about the “brave new world” of future trade deals.“It is concerning that the government seems more interested in carrying water for Donald Trump and his #America First# mentality than in supporting our farmers. The government should be accountable to the people they represent, not the whims of US negotiators.”Speaking in the House earlier in the week, Mr Carmichael highlighted the potential impact to farmers and crofters in the Northern Isles: “I would like to hear what the Government’s response is to press reports today that the Government are set to open British markets to food products produced to lower US standards as part of the trade deal with Donald Trump. This was the rhetoric we were given by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: he told us that there would never be chlorinated chicken on our plate.“Now, in fact, we hear that as a consequence of the so-called dual tarf process it is quite possible that we will see such products being imported to this country. In fact, we are told that the Secretary of State for International Trade is arguing that these tarfs should be reduced to zero over  years, giving farmers time to adjust to the new “normal”.“For the farmers and crofters in my constituency, it will be a hard reality for them to survive in. Because we are a long distance from the market, we have not gone for mass-produced food. We have sought to improve the quality of the products we have and put into market with a view to export. Tarfs on those export markets will be absolutely fatal to the agricultural interests of the highlands and islands.”Responding for the government, the Paymaster General, Penny Mordaunt MP, said: “I fully understand why he may be sceptical about trusting the government, but trust the people. They value animal welfare, we should trust the consumer and there are massive opportunities for our farmers for rest of world trade.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At the Sandwick Manse, he kept a daily record for  years, beginning in , and became a recognised expert on Scotland’s weather.After Clouston’s death, the station moved around Orkney but kept going right up until WWII. Magnus Spence ran it in Deerness for almost thirty years,  – . His son, Magnus Thorfinn Spence, was Chief Meteorologist for Bomber Command during WWII. With very neat symmetry, the story now moves to the other end of the world # to the South Orkney Islands. Base Orcadas is an Argentinian weather station but it was founded in  by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, led by William Spiers Bruce. His grandmother was Charity Isbister, whose father Caleb owned Ness Farm, Stromness. Spiers Bruce went to the Antarctic as a scientist on a whaling expedition in  and became fascinated by the polar regions. He went on expeditions to the Arctic and, when he couldn’t get there, he went to the top of Ben Nevis, which had snow cover for  days of the year. An Observatory had been built there in  by the Scottish Meteorological Society, to try to learn more about weather patterns. The first Superintendent was RTOmond, the son of Robert Omond from Kirkwall, who became President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Mary Traill, daughter of Professor Thomas Stewart Traill, . Omond was involved with the Observatory right from its planning stages. Ill health forced him down from the summit after seven years, but he remained in overall charge until the Observatory closed in . William Spiers Bruce had applied to join Scott’s expedition to the Antarctic. When, despite being one of the most experienced Polar scientists in the country, his application was rejected, he raised the funds for an expedition supported by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of - is not as famous as those of Scott and Shackleton but it has been described as one of the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientic expeditions of the age. As well as establishing the weather station, the expedition brought back a large number of botanical, biological, zoological and geological samples. The house built for the men and their instruments was called Omond House. As well as giving Spiers Bruce a lot of practical and scientic advice, Omond had given a very sizeable donation to the expedition.The Ben Nevis Observatory only lasted eighteen years and only had three observers so it is strange that there is still more Orcadian involvement. According to his entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Charles Anderson, from Moa in Stenness, was the Superintendent there after he graduated in . He quickly realised he wanted to be somewhere warmer and went to work at the Australian Museum in Sydney in , eventually becoming its director.The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. A biography Charles Anderson is available on the #People# page of www.aboutorkney.

The minister has agreed to look at Mr McArthur’s suggestion and highlighted that the government is looking at a range of ways to offer support to farmers.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “The COVID- outbreak has forced ious initiatives planned by SNH and the Orkney Greylag Goose Management group to be put on hold. As a result, local farmers have been faced with having to spend more time and resources trying to keep resident greylag geese numbers under control.“I know from seeing first-hand the impact that greylag geese can have on crops and farmland. Over recent years, as the resident Greylag population has increased, so too has the damage and the cost of trying to address the problem. “It would seem sensible, therefore, to use any funding earmarked for the earlier control measures to help reduce the financial burden on farmers having to take steps themselves. This could include contributing to the cost of cartridges, but there may be other options available.“I’m pleased that the minister responded positively to this suggestion and agree to explore the options for providing such support, as well as wider efforts to bring Orkney’s resident Greylag goose population down to more sustainable levels.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Food stocks are good, helped by food coming in from both the Scottish government through the council hub and from the national support effort organised by Tesco.“These two sources have really helped to boost our normal regular food donations coming in through local shops.“Where necessary we have also been able to buy in additional food and toiletries using the funds which we have received from many dferent sources.”SIC education and families committee chairman George Smith said the figures were “concerning” and urged anyone who thought they may be entitled to free school meals to make the necessary enquiries.Mr Smith said: “It’s obviously concerning and disappointing that there is an increased demand on the foodbank particularly from families.George Smith: #There are probably people accessing the foodbank who have never had to do so in the past#“There are probably people accessing the foodbank that have never had to do so in the past.“I would encourage anybody entitled to free school meals to be making sure they make that application“We are paying £ a day, and that goes into the bank account.”Mr Smith’s comments came as the Scottish government highlighted additional support it was providing from its £ million Food Fund.FareShare, a national network of charitable food distributors, has distributed over , tonnes of food – the equivalent of almost . million meals – since rd March, supported by £, of Scottish government funding.Now, an additional £. million of funding will help FareShare purchase more food for local authorities, community-run initiatives and frontline charities across Scotland.Mr Grieve said: “This is very welcome news as Shetland has been benefiting from the government’s support following the announcement of the initial £, funding and I fully expect that the need for this support will remain for many months to come, even when the pandemic is fully controlled.“The Trussell Trust announced today that nationally there has been an  per cent increase in demand for support during April compared with  and more alarmingly there was a  per cent rise in support for children.”Scottish communities minister Aileen Campbell said: “At this dficult time, it is more important than ever that we tackle food insecurity by supporting the work of community food distribution groups across the country who are best placed to ensure vital supplies reach those who need it most.“By working in partnership with FareShare and their partners in communities across Scotland, this extra funding will help frontline charities and community food groups provide support to even more people in need.” raquoWe were told there was no magic money tree.

If born in Delhi then you might be Hindi or Sikh.Kenyans are more likely to be Christian.In Scotland, your type of Christianity might also depend on location catholics and protestants coming from fairly well-defined geographical areas.Of course, culture is more than religion, but even for non-adherents and atheists, it is often a signicant part of the richness of the societies we live in.I was in Bali, Indonesia earlier this year during the festival of Galungan.The place was literally dripping with decorations.Ornate and huge ‘penjor’ lined the roads and adorned buildings, taller than telegraph poles and more prevalent, they were beautully twisted and plaited from palm fronds.Shrines and offerings were everywhere. It was vibrant, colourful and beautul. It was a religious festival, but totally embedded in the culture of the Balinese, in the way Christmas is in Scotland.Balinese people are among the friendliest I have come across in all my travels, a genuine and warmth in their demeanour.Balinese folk are brown in colour, because it is very sunny in Indonesia they have evolved to have more melanin, and therefore more protection against the sun.We don’t choose the colour of our skin, or the culture we are born into, but what we do with our lot is a product of our upbringing, our wider society experience and everything that has happened to us.Most of our behaviour is due to nurture not nature, and is down to choice.Our values and empathies lie in our reaction to our experience and learning from consequence. The problem stems in that much of that experience lies out with our control.If we are black, poor and have been persecuted by institutional society since birth, we might take to the streets.When pepper sprayed, or met with water canon, rubber bullet or tear gas, we might resort to throwing rocks, petrol bombs.Windows might be broken, we might loot.If our role model father figure was a gun toting white supremacist, we might believe ourselves to have a greater entitlement than those of a dferent colour.We would be wrong.These are extreme examples # rationalising and trying to understand the actions of others is fraught with generalisation and perhaps cliché.We can never know what makes a person act the way they do, and we can only imagine being in their shoes, and seeing through the lens of their eyes.What is as tragic as a police officer killing another human being in a slow, seemingly deliberate fashion, is that a society, a culture and its institution can produce someone capable and accepting of such an action.I hope the killer will be brought to justice, and that a grieving family can find peace and forgiveness, but more importantly can we heal the society that produces this behaviour.Most of the ills are due to poverty, deprivation, and the inequality of opportunity.Fear and ignorance is layered on top, with greed and entitlement. Power normally resides with the rich, who want to stay rich.The cry is that we are all the same underneath, black, white, brown yellow, and yet we are all dferent, unique, products of vastly dferent culture, geography, upbringing, beliefs and experience.We are both the same and both dferent, and this confusing contradiction should be embraced, celebrated and above all respected.Scotland is known for celebrating ersity, but it is more than the music, the festivals, the ceremonies and the food, it is the people and their attitudes and their experience we should celebrate.It may be sometime before visitors from other continents arrive back to the Highlands in any number, but our communities as hosts are in a perfect situation to embrace the cultures brought and above all respect both dferences and similarities.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine..Bha an cunntas agam mu mhurt Dhòmhnaill mhic Uilleim ann an sgìre Chnoc Mhoire faisg air a’ Mhanachainn.

course, it’s a good thing.Very often we tend to forget where we feel we belong, particularlywe have been ‘transplanted’ where, either through natural migration or simply not being allowed back to your own bed because you are perceived as a walking , potential germ time-bomb.Despite Gaina being willing to take the daily risk, and my being eternally grateful that she is Marvin Gaye was wrong.Wherever I lay myhat, it’s certainly not my home.I lived in the centre of Stornoway in a previous le.It was tolerable because the front door of the Royal Hotelwas the distance of a free-kick from just outside the penalty box away.Barring that, the Wee Co-op and the Trading Post provided hugely comforting ‘book ends’, sandwiched as I was, comfortably in between.When nary an eyebrow was raised when you ordered a can of Special Vat cider at  in the morning, paying with a handful of change where a p was undoubtedly king of the finds the determination of where my ‘home’ was largely depended on proximity to alcohol.Luckily things have changed.It doesn’t take much to calibrate where you truly belong.I dare say that for each and every one of us that calibration is measured dferently, using dferent tools and metrics.Each to their own.There are bound to be many for whom the lockdown has heightened their state of anxiety.Townies, I respectfully suggest, much more than others.Waking on Sunday, after a night burning not much rubber, to the noise of whatever it was that had driven herself indoors from her crocheting in the sun I could feel the sap rise.A terrace in the capital is no place when the sun shines brightly and the neighbours are Status Quo fans.The decision was immediate.It required just the two connected synapses to flicker briefly.“Pack what you need, we’re going to Point”.As she continued with the never-ending blanket in the warmth and safety of the Republic, I decided to head for the shore.Something I don’t do nearly often enough is walk through my own village, in my own time, grown increasingly comfortable in my own head.With a colander on the cranium, attached to many electrodes and a Sinclair ZX , a compass and a barometer handy I reckon my epicentre would be found somewhere between my front door, Shinigeadh, Loch an Duin and Allt Diobadal.Shinigeadh was picture perfect.The walk down to the geodha was spectacular.Even the sheep knew I wasn’t a tourist.I’d wax more lyrical, but I know you’re already jealous.‘Mata’ MacIver, in his wonderful monthly column, ‘My Portnaguran’ in our local magazinealludes to the importance of our local football team when it comes to our sense of community.Guess who were amongst the very first to respond and offer their services when the Covid crisis struck Along with the people you’d expectthey were the first to coordinate support to anyone in need.Never mind the locally elected representatives and the Community Council we were left standing whilst the people of the Roo did what decent folk do.By the time we caught up, deliveries and safety nets were already in place.It was happening all over these islands and the people who don’t require prompting to do the right thing and never stop to look for recognition or thanks.It’s not what they’re about or why they get involved.But can we take the time to recognise each and every single one of them next time we step outside to clap The whole weekend was confusing for many unable to restrain themselves following weeks of conflicting messages.There was, of course, theof golf and fishing as part of the easing of the lockdown but throw in Dominic Cummings, the huge sense of relief at ‘something’ positive happening, no new cases in the Western Isles for nearly six weeks plus spectacular weather, and you could feel the collective engines revving.We should have been thinking of going from neutral into first gear as part of a gradual process back to a semblance of normality .What we saw was akin to the starting grid of a Formula  race.The lights went from red to green and, with added Buckfast and MD , a little bit of mayhem ensued.It was, in hindsightentirely predictable.A scientist, rocket or otherwise, wasn’t required.Luckily, or unluckily, the weather has ed to normal and, after some warnings, people recognised that their actions were premature and inappropriate.This ‘thing’ isn’t over and we need to remain vigilant.Complacency is our biggest danger, still.Let’s get back to keeping it real.Truth be told, we couldn’t wait.After a ten week lay-off, it was never going to be pretty.Especially for those of us who might still tend to struggle having played ten rounds in ten days.Naturally I started with a par at the, stroke-index one, hugely troublesome, opening hole at Stornoway.I may only ever manage a handful of fours in a season at the ‘Castle’, so the huge joke was on me and playing partner, Alan ‘Biddley’ MacLeod.‘Bid’s’ tee shot had last been seen heading left towards the Woodlands Centre and I fully expected to follow suit.I managed the plumb centre of the trees on the right, but miraculously played some decent recovery golf, albeit only briefly.It wasn’t so much a case of ‘it’s downhill after this’, which it certainly was, more a case of ‘who cares, isn’t this wonderful ’.Much like halitosis, any golf is better than no golf at all.We kept score, briefly, before it all became a bit too much and we decided to enjoy ourselves.The course was full.The sun was shining.Genuinely it was hotter than it had been in Florida last October.‘Things’, generally couldn’t be better.We will, naturally, spend a couple of weeks ‘acclimatising’ before we plunge headlong into competitive golf proper.That night my legs and feet ached, my back required some WD, but a’ bhalaich, I was a happy bunny.I wasn’t alone.Who was keeping score anyway Colin MacRitchie’s playing partner on Saturday, that’s who.Whilst some of us require several layers of cobwebs to be removed before we can be considered ‘contenders’ the talented require nothing more than a robust practice swing.Starting with a bogey, , at the ‘Castle’, nobody could have predicted the explosives to follow.Yes it was just a ‘bounce’ round and yes, we were still only playing off the yellow tees: but that didn’t detract much from the incredulity with which his card was greeted.From the second hole he went birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie, eagle, birdieto be ‘out’ in a breath-taking, -under, .He started back with yet another brace of birdies before completely losing form and racking up ‘just’ seven straight pars.  #         # Going round anywhere, at any time, in  blows is a stunning achievement.It certainly posts a warning to the other serious contenders for the summer season and the ‘majors’ ahead, however truncated it they may be.The Scarista faithful, too, were busy finding themselves at the weekend.Nobody was too keen to blow anything resembling the remotest trumpet, regards any semi-official scoring but the sense I got was that greenkeeper James Dunne was possibly the man to keep a close eye on.He spent the weekend asking about the bounce and loft on wedges.“ or  degrees loft with - degree bounce ”, he queried.Billy Fraser, who actually does know what he was talking about, chipped in with what appeared to be sound, indeed polite, advice.‘Bounce is your friend’ Captain Kuna opined.Now there’s a man in touch with his inner Barbara Woodhouse.Having latterly abandoned the notion of flailing around with a driver, or any fairway woods, James has foundthat his scoring has dramatically improved.The ‘Essence of Harris’ Trophy this Saturday may well be his opportunity to demonstrate his new-found Karma.Benbecula threw themselves straight back into competitive action with their May Medal last Saturday. Donald MacKay won with a nett , two shots ahead of Dami Steele on .Both qualy for the end of season gold medal.On Tuesday they began the season-long Order of Merit with a Willie Monkwin. Dami continued his runner-up habit.Down at Askernish they’re still probably trying to get over the shock of my naming it as my favourite course on ‘Spors na Seachdain’.I’ve been lucky enough to have played some wonderful courses these past -odd years but the South Uist links still ‘does it’ for me every time.I even considered becoming a member this year, along with Stornoway and Harris before Covid took a hold.Too far Maybe I should approach the Tiumpan Head grazings committee.What a course that would make.You’d never get me out of Point.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rosswa-logo.jpg","title":"ross shire skye and lochalsh womens aid are here for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineRoss-shire Skye and Lochalsh Women’s Aid provides services to women, children, and young people in the Ross-shire, Skye, and Lochalsh areas that are experiencing, or have experienced, the effects of domestic abuse.

Bro. Edward Stevenson has appointed Deputy Grand Master Wor. Bro Harold Henning to oversee events.Bro. Henning commented: “Just because our parades and gatherings may be cancelled – the  Twelfth isn’t! King William’s momentous and symbolic victory at the Boyne  years ago will most certainly still be celebrated and commemorated in a number of ways by the Orange family.”There will be a wide range of activities and resources available on the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland website - goli.org.uk thathome - specially designed to ensure all members of the Orange Family can enjoy the long weekend.The cornerstone of this special celebration will be ‘Radio Boyne’ featuring four days of digital broadcasting which can be accessed through the Grand Lodge websitewhen it goes live on the th July. It is anticipated that a range of guest interviews, music, news and history programming will be featured.The broad focus will be on activities for all the family. A section has been created on the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland website with colouring, crafts, recipes and other ideas to help make your ‘th at Home’ a success.The traditional elements of the Twelfth of July demonstrations, including the reading of the resolutions and the religious service will be broadcast online, both through Facebook and the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland’s YouTube channel. Acts of remembrance, such as laying wreaths, will also be covered. The Grand Chaplains will be preparing a special prayer to be read out on the day. There will also be a Boyne Annual Divine Service online on Sunday, th of July.The Deputy Grand Master has encouraged families to start planning for their ‘th at Home’ now. “Our challenge is to ensure this Twelfth is marked in style online, in your home, at your door, with families and neighbours. Together we can make it a fun-filled, extra-special - socially distanced th - that will be talked about for years,” he explained. “The Grand Lodge website seeks to support and resource the Boyne Anniversary Celebrations. There is something for everyone: craft and colouring pages for the young and recipes for your th night Barbecue.“So, begin by planning to suitably decorate your home, street, village or town - fly the flag, proudly and respectfully. Encourage children and grandchildren to watch our craft videos and create Orange Lilies and bunting or brush up your history by reading about William’s Generals.”Bro. Henning also highlighted the need for all celebrations to respect and adhere to the social distancing guidelines in place to prevent the spread of Coronavirus.He added: “During our celebrations let us be mindful that the priority in  is to look after everyone’s health this Twelfth as we continue the battle against Coronavirus. Please ensure you comply with the lockdown regulations in existence over the period.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3156812.jpg--.jpg?1591176601000\n","title":"the star attraction professor brian cox for ballymena event","story":" BALLYMENA is to host the first Northern Ireland Science School – hosted by Professor Brian Cox OBE, the acclaimed physicist and BBC presenter.The Science School, backed by Mid and East Antrim Council, is aimed at inspiring the next generation of scientists and innovators.

The future need for more scientists and engineers nationally has been highlighted as a priority by the current Coronavirus pandemic.Lord Mawson OBE said: “This is an appropriate time to be bringing the first Science School hosted by Professor Cox to Ballymena!“Science and the desire to learn more about how our world works, and about how we can use that information to improve how we live our lives, has never been more attractive or relevant as a subject area and a potential career path.”Professor Brian Cox OBE added: “The Coronavirus pandemic vividly illustrates the importance of understanding the natural world a perfect definition of science.“The solutions will come in the form of effective treatments and a vaccine. These will be found because of the understanding we have of viruses, genetics and our immune system built up over many years.“A great deal of this knowledge was acquired by scientists who were simply curious about how Nature works. In that statement there is a lesson and a reason for hope.“Curiosity is a powerful thing, and science is about harnessing curiosity and honing it into the best method we have for acquiring new knowledge and exploring the unknown.“That’s what science is all about, and that’s why we need you to become the scientists of the future!

Pupils benefit from a child centred education, which is enhanced by the schools countryside setting, providing regular outdoor learning.Despite this and the schools recent achievement, the school is currently proposed for closure in Summer . This comes as a signicant blow, as the school has been a constant champion of community values in past and recent times. The school has proved an epicentre for numerous local events and community activities from car washes to last years K Run which have brought all sections of the community together for time together in fun and friendship.

By John BreslinJune   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMore expensive pints, small clusters of people at tables spaced apart, no sitting or standing for anyof time at the bar, and no live music or dancing - this is likely to be the experience for some months once the pubs reopen, according to those in the industry.Establishments likely to fare best on the resumption of service are larger pubs and those with outdoor space or beer gardens.Social distancing will mean fewer punters on the premises, and that could mean price hikes.The industry will also be pushing the Executive and local authorities to allow them to enhance the outdoor experience by relaxing restrictions on the use of adjacent space. After the Republic announced bars can operate as restaurants from June , and all will be allowed to open on July , there is pressure on the Stormont Executive, which met on Monday, to reveal a timeline. It#s expected to announce further rule relaxations on Thursday.But according to some publicans, it is logical for Northern Ireland to operate in tandem with the south. While pub owners have received no advice and guidance on re-opening, they have their own thoughts on how it can happen, and what the experience will be like.Pedro Donald, who owns the Sunflower and the American Bar in Belfast, said the lack of guidelines makes it dficult to plan ahead, other than knowing staff will have to keep their hands clean and sanitised, and that there will be social distancing.As far as putting structures up, including screens, we are not going to do that unless we know we need to, said Mr Donald.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePedro Donald of Sunflower Bar FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPedro Donald of Sunflower BarHe added: We will not be doing sessions initially as they would need to be spread out and space is going to be a premium. The hospitality industry has warned that pubs and restaurants may be unable to reopenthe two metre social distancing rule is not reduced. The two metre rule will not work inside Mr Donald#s bars, both of which are small two-floor spaces, although the Sunflower also has a popular large outdoor area. If that rule remains in place, he said would be able to host about four people.Mr Donald said he will not be inviting or encouraging crowds to come to his premises, but he is not sure whether there will be a big rush to the pub. A lot of people might see how it is working, while others will want to go right back, he said. The Belfast bar owner expects to have the same number of staff, with less behind the bar but more on the door and policing the toilets.Willie Jack, owner of the Harp Bar, the Dark Horse and the Duke Of York, among other establishments, believes it makes sense for bars north and south to open at the same time, rather than potentially see pubs in Londonderry and Bundoran working on a dferent schedule.He believes Monday, July  is a sensible date as it would be better not to open on a pay day at the end of the month, a weekend, or a holiday like the Twelfth. A wet Monday or Tuesday night when there is no pressure, he said.The publican expects no standing or sitting at the bar, and customers being served at certain points then ing to their table. He noted that certain countries and the World Health Organisation have endorsed the one-metre rule.There will be no live music in his venues initially, then possibly single singer songwriters. Mr Jack expects capacity to be reduced to between  and % depending on what rules are put in place by the Executive.Prices might have to go up, he said, adding that he does not want to see customers partitioned by screens.A number of his establishments are in the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast, and he wants to work with the City Council to pedestrianise the area in the evening and at weekends. Managing taxi ranks and portable toilets will be vitalthat happens, Mr Jack added. Otherwise, staff are likely to be washing hands every half hour, using sanitiser but not wearing gloves or masks, the publicans said.On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the two-metre rule and said businesses may have to rely on their ingenuity to operate within the restriction. He said the rule was under review, but, ultimately, it isn#t the rule that#s the challenge to the opening of hospitality in a safe way, it#s the virus. And in the Republic, Business Minister Heather Humphreys said yesterday that the two-metre rule may be changed provided that coronavirus figures go in the right direction and the transmission rate remains low.

I watched people walking along, walking dogs there were two older people walking arm-in-arm and I just thought that this is what le is about.I would have stayed there all day evenit had been snowing.Lockdown has been tough for Christine, who suffered a heart attack while at the gym with Herman.However, true to form, she has tried to remain as upbeat as possible throughout the dficult experience.My husband is older and is quite vulnerable and with my heart, I knew we would have to shield so I was quite pragmatic about it, she explained.We have some lovely neighbours who offered to help us and I was able to sign up to get food deliveries.I was able to move some exercise equipment into the little study that we could use, and we go for a daily constitutional around the house as well. We#re also very avid readers.We have gone out and waved and shouted over to the neighbours.It has been hard but I feel especially sorry for people who are completely on their own. At least we had each other and we still quite like each other after  years.It can be quite isolating so that#s why charities like the British Heart Foundation are so important in supporting people at this time.We love the time of year from January on when the lambs are starting to appear in the fields and the first hints of green start to come through, so we have missed that but we can#t change it and we just have to get on with it.I just hope there is no second surge.

three, while Sinn Fein and the SDLP have two each.The last fortnight has seen the election of mayors and council chairs across Northern Ireland.The Local GovernmentAct states that councils# annual general meetings must take place in June.However, this year the Covid- pandemic means mayors and deputy mayors begin their year in office in unique circumstances as the first to be inaugurated through a virtual meeting streamed live online.Councils are permitted to postpone their AGM up to September  but only one - Antrim and Newtownabbey - has chosen to wait until the autumn to elect its new UUP

His deputy for the coming year is the SDLP#s John Coyle. The pandemic also meant the usual traditions were abandoned when DUP councillor Frank McCoubrey was installed as Lord Mayor in Belfast City Hall. His predecessor did not place the chain of office around Mr McCoubrey#s shoulders rather, the city#s new first citizen removed it from a plinth and did so himself.There were no handshakes from fellow councillors but a round of applause as SDLP councillor Paul McCusker was also installed as Belfast#s Deputy Lord Mayor. Ards and North Down has elected two DUP councillors - Trevor Cummings and Nigel Edmund - as mayor and deputy mayor respectively for the coming year. It#s a similar story in Lisburn and Castlereagh, which selected former Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble#s son Nicholas as its new mayor alongside his deputy and party colleague, Jenny Palmer.Mid and East Antrim will be represented by a Carrickfergus duo - DUP member Peter Johnston will be mayor with Ulster Unionist Andrew Wilson his deputy. Causeway Coast and Glens held its AGM last night when the DUP#s Mark Fielding took over the chairman#s role, while Tom McKeown of the UUP will be the deputy.Meanwhile SDLP councillor Brian Tierney took over the reins in Derry City and Strabane and he will be supported in his role by the DUP#s Graham Warke.The SDLP#s Laura Devlin heads Newry, Mourne and Down, assisted by the UUP#s Harold McKee as deputy chair.

I would highly recommend this course to anyone seeking to further their education whatever path they are planning to take.” Little sister Danielle, who completed the Access Course a year before Aisling, is now working in Australia as a nurse. Danielle said: I decided to do the course as I thought it would be the perfect stepping stone to get into the nursing degree I desired. I did not get enough points from my Leaving Certicate so this was another path available that enabled me access. “The course was very good and I would highly recommend to others looking to pursue their career in Nursing or further their education in any way. As a mature student I found the course eased you back into doing assignments and got your brain working academically again. The tutors were very helpful and really wanted you to do your best. “I got into Magee nursing the same year I finished the access course. I would totally recommend this course to others and I have already recommended it to many of my friends in the past.” The Access Course in Combined Studies at North West Regional College offers an opportunity for students normally over  years of age, who have been out of full time education for at least one year, a chance toto study. NWRC offers Access Courses in Health and Welfare, Science, and Combined Studies, which are all validated by local universities.

Seldom would you attend a Lavey game without bumping into him. He was never far from the effort needed to keep the wheels of the club turning. Every management team he was involved with, benefited from his diligent efforts. And he never walked past without speaking. Ians gone. And we are devastated, read the words on Laveys social media. In our club, Ian Hendry was peerless - as passionate Lavey man as there has ever been. Jovial, witty, unassuming and steadfastly loyal, Ian Hendry cut no corners in his work over many years with all Lavey teams, the statement continued. googletag.cmd.push His dedication to the cause will be the source of many stories over the coming days, weeks and indeed years. He ferociously protected all things Lavey footballs, hurls, sliotars, jerseys and above all, club pride. Two seasons ago, Lavey Us played in the final of the Paul McGirr U tournament, in the teeming rain. A game they almost wrestled back from Carrickmores clutches. In defeat, the team bounced back to win the Ulster minor tournament. On that day in Dromore, in the midst of the Us disappointment, a football went missing. Ian wasnt defeated. Not yet. When Lavey ed in for an Ulster league game with Dromore the following, he went looking again and found it. googletag.cmd.push It typied the unyielding determination of Ian Hendry who was above all a kind hearted and generous man, a loving husband, father and devoted grandfather, Laveys statement added. Our thoughts and prayers are with Ians we Agnes, daughters Orla, Mairead and Dymphna, sons Cahal and Eunan and all the wider family circle and friends. Like the story of the lost and recovered football, Ian never forgot. And Lavey will never forget Ian Hendry. Ar dheis Deacute go raibh a anam uasal.

The Derry senior football championship has reverted back to knock-out in recent seasons and with club leagues set to be phased out this year, it would only guarantee club players one competitive game.

The Derry hurling championships had been successfully tied in with the league in recent seasons to give more games. Without a league, a draw will be needed for the championship.

Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone welcomed the confirmation of the starting date for the project. “I welcome confirmation of the anticipated start date of June  for the construction of the two double prefabricated replacement classrooms at St Patrick’s College, Maghera,” he said. “This project followed an on-site visit by senior Department of Education officials to the school that I arranged last summer, which was also attended by local SDLP Councillor Martin Kearney. googletag.cmd.push “These new classrooms will replace some that are in an extremely poor condition and were only ever intended to be a temporary solution. Mr McGlone said he would work with both the Department and the school to ensure the new classrooms are in place in time for the new school year. He said: “It was initially expected that construction of the replacement classrooms would be completed in August this year. “While this may no longer be the case it is still hoped that they will be ready for the start of the new term.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plan was to bring entertainment to the war weary inhabitants of the town.This meeting would lead to the formation of St Patrickrsquos Operatic and Pantomime Society and their first production was Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter mdash a title that has dated somewhat.The public responded by volunteering as actors, stage hands, working with costumes and music.Principals and chorus rehearsed separately. Only one week before opening night did they merge, coming together for the first time on the stage of St Patrickrsquos Hall.It was advertised as lsquoA Feast of Music, Song and Dancersquo boasting  voices. Rehearsal took place in the McLean home, the cast rehearsed upstairs, while machinists and costumiers worked downstairs.Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter was performed on Sunday, May , and Monday, May , .It proved successful enough to be followed in  by other productions such as Tangles, The Enchanted Rose and Quest of Olwen.The performances, in the absence of film footage and photographs, appear to be lost in the haze of time.Tangles, described as a grand musical comedy, was performed in St Patrickrsquos Hall on Monday, June , the night before the Normandy Landings. The performance was in aid of the Down County Infirmary.The programme included cast and production notes. The actors, credited as lsquoMortalsrsquo included Michael Tomelty as Lollipop, Sally King as Princess Pansy, Lillian Lundy as Dame Mouldy, Leslie Rice as Lord Humbug and Master Michael Rea as the Inn Keeperrsquos Son. lsquoImmortalsrsquo included Peggy Halloran as Titania, Maura Blaney as Nona and Mary Gilmore as lsquoCinderellarsquo.Also included was an array of guardsmen, a chorus of fairies, village chorus, court dancers, innkeeper chorus, fairy partners, bunnies and a chorus of gnomes, who included Maureen Dorrian, Annie Murphy and June Doyle.

Hopefully, therersquos more to come, he said.Joersquos latest work is QUINN - No Place to Hide, a standalone follow-up to a successful launch of the first in the series. The title is dedicated to his great grandfather, Sam Quinn, a man Joe admired for the way in which he dealt with the harshness of le in Downpatrick at the turn of the twentieth century.ldquoHe worked -hour shts, six days a week, as a yard foreman at the Rearsquos bottling plant in Market Street, Downpatrick. It was backbreaking work for which he earned a pittance to feed a large family. He never complained, never took a holiday, and never ventured outside the confines of the town. He lived through two world wars, the creation of the Irish Republic, and countless other momentous times, yet he kept his head down and simply got on with his own le.Joe is quick to point out that the character in his latest book is nothing like his ancestor. ldquoAll Irsquove taken is his name. My version of Quinn is that of an international assassin who leaves Downpatrick to join the Irish Rangers and later becomes a gun for hire in America. Talk about two dferent worlds! Perhaps though, therersquos a bit of parallel in that I transferred old Sam Quinnrsquos stoicism and relentless nature into a make-believe cut-out who lives his le by those very ideals.With a -year background in journalism, it was hardly surprising that Joe wanted to keep writing when he switched careers in  to head up Down Business Centre, a support enterprise agency to help promote start-up businesses.He said: ldquoI loved the interaction with local entrepreneurs, but the writing bug doesnrsquot go away. I had always an idea for a book and couldnrsquot stop scratching the itch. After a few years, I decided to put it into action.That first book mdash SOMEONE HAS TO PAY mdash was a product of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It is set in the unlikely surroundings of Bishopscourt, a former RAF base just outside Downpatrick, and features a British government elite squad assembled under the relative anonymity of the old complex for the purposes of waging a final shoot-to-kill war against the IRA.Joersquos own assessment of the story brings a wry smile. ldquoItrsquos a far-fetched idea, isnrsquot it  It couldnrsquot have happened, could it  Thatrsquos the essence of the storyteller and I guess itrsquos why I love doing it.A recurring theme in Joersquos books is that he likes toin a mention of his hometown whenever possible. Yoursquoll find Downpatrick cropping up a lot in background narratives, or as the setting for a few hair-raising episodes that attempt to weave their way into the history and fabric of the area.ldquoItrsquos just something I like to do. Irsquom a Downpatrick man and I have the urge to shout about it when the chance arises. Wersquove a lot going for us in this area and it can only do good to let the world know wersquore here.One of his other books SPENT FORCE, which was a crime thriller set in the West of Ireland and featured a fading Garda detective, attracted praise from two signicant sources. One was Ken Bruen, the international bestselling author of the Jack Taylor Irish crime series, who wrote: ldquoSometimes a book comes along that you instantly know......damn, I am now going to have to read this all over again for the sheer joy of the narrative. It means that I will have to swear off other books for a time as very few can provide the utter joy and delight of Joe McCoubreyrsquos superb novel.Another unexpected source was a serving Garda sergeant who posted a glowing review on the Amazon . ldquoA top-class novel which deserves high praise. I am from Irish law enforcement and this novel is as close to a real-le investigation as you can get. Gripping from start to finish, totally believable characters, strong storyline, Highly Recommended.Joe admits he was floored by the feedback. ldquoOn the one hand there was an endorsement by perhaps Irelandrsquos foremost crime thriller author, while on the other there was vindication from a policeman that the research and effort to get things right had paid off. Itrsquos what any author craves, and itrsquos what makes you want to get back over the keyboard and start into the next adventure.That next adventure is taking Joe back to the West of Ireland to team up again with his favourite Garda detective. The sequel is provisionally titled FORCE OF NATURE which delves into the murky world of a serial killer. Not surprisingly, Downpatrick features heavily again.ldquoYes, the killerrsquos first three victims are young girls from Downpatrick. The story will move from here to Westport and back again. Irsquom still not sure how it will end, and thatrsquos as much an appeal to me as it is to the reader.Joe explains that hersquos not a dedicated story plotter. ldquoI use a broad brush. I get an idea and just run with it. I donrsquot like to be confined to structure from start to finish, with the result that Irsquom not quite sure where Irsquom going from one chapter to another. I think of it as being spontaneous, which means I usually go off on tangents that keeps things fresh and moving along. Itrsquos a seat-of-the-pants alternative to being a plotter.Joe publishes all his books under his own publishing house, Inishfree Communications, which also offers support to local writers. To date, he has helped eight others to complete their author journey ndash between them they have published more than  titles. He provides proofing, formatting, and design services, including suggestions on the most effective covers for inidual books.ldquoItrsquos a big part of what I do these days, says Joe. ldquoThere are lots of budding writers and independent authors out there who just need a bit of extra help and encouragement to bring their work in front of the masses. I get as much of a kick out of seeing these books go on sale as I do from my own works.Joe McCoubreyrsquos books are available as paperbacks or eBooks on the Amazon and Barnes  Noble s..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Call for hedge removal after near miss  ","story":"AN overgrown hedge close to a BT exchange in Killyleagh is being blamed for a near miss involving a pedestrian and a bus last week.A woman who was forced to step on to the main road to avoid the hedge was almost struck by the vehicle as it passed, leaving both her and the driver shaken.BT has confirmed that it plans to cut the hedge this week, but local councillor Billy Walker said the telecoms giant must go further and remove it completely.He said there was a wall behind the hedge, suggesting that once the hedge is removed, BT would only have to build a small fence on top of it to secure its base.ldquoThe overgrown hedge has been an issue for many years and there have been countless near misses involving people who have had to step off the footpath to pass, including mums with prams. What happened last Friday is the final straw as far as I am concerned, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe only sensible solution is to remove the hedge in its entirety. To do so would not cost a lot of money, but would save lives as at this time of year as people would not have to walk on a busy main road to pass.Cllr Walker says he has raised the issue with the telecoms company over the years, but was told the hedge could not be cut back as it was the nesting season.ldquoMy biggest fear has always been that someone could end up getting killed or seriously injured at this part of Killyleagh. While I am thankful the woman who stepped off the footpath last Friday was not seriously injured, this must be the last incident of this kind, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI am appealing to BT to do the decent thing and finally remove the hedge. We have been fortunate up until now no one has been injured, but I shudder to think what could happen at this location.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThis situation is a major accident waiting to happen, but it can be avoided by simply removing a hedge. It is s no brainer and I hope BT will agree to my request.A BT spokesperson said the organisation was sorry to learn of the distress that the hedge may have caused and would be in contact with Cllr Walker directly.ldquoThe hedge is scheduled to be trimmed back this week.

Some people have looked at Everest and thought climbing it is necessary. Others call those people crazy.Everesting is described as ldquofiendishly simple, yet brutally hard. Ride hill repeats on any hill anywhere in the world mdash or on Zwt, the virtual cycling simulator mdash in a single activity until you climb the equivalent height of Mount Everest.The concept was created by Hells , who also control the induction into the Everesting Hall of Fame. Website Everesting.cc contains the rules to follow.Well, call me crazy, but I did it. No, I didnrsquot fly to Nepal and climb the actual mountain. Irsquom not a former pro athlete or extraordinarily gted human, nor am I an adventure adrenaline junkie looking for a fix. Irsquom just a  something mdash  to be precise mdash son of God who has a family, a job, a dog, a bicycle, and I landed myself in the Everesting Hall of Fame. And you can too.I decided to use the challenge to help raise funds for mental health organisations Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Service, or The Hub, as itrsquos known locally. My initial target was pound but I was astounded and humbled by the generosity of people. In the end donations totalled pound,.I chose to start at am so I could have family support at the finish. Despite the early start I was joined by my we, Jennie, and through the day she was a great support, bringing me fresh drinks and relaying messages of support.I turned on my favourite music playlist and hit the hill with a measured effort that I thought I could sustain for hours. I planned a bidon of sports drink for each ascent, as well as -g carbs per hour. Real foods early in the ride and gels and sugary drinks for later in the ride.The first three or four ascents felt strangely comfortable, averaging  minutes up each time. I was almost an hour ahead of my estimated -hour schedule by midday. I later noticed some friends,, who were tracking my progress, were saying how strong I was riding and hoped that I wouldnrsquot pay for it later.They were right! Ascents six and seven were so tough, even to the point where I felt physically ill, and my times were now over  minutes per climb.vEveresters add the tag lsquovEverestingrsquo to their Zwt profile name which means anyone on the course that sees it knows you are vEveresting and many will ride with you, congratulate you, give you a thumbs up, or just encourage you to keep going.These wonderful sherpas made it a much more enjoyable experience, especially during the sixth and seventh ascents when it was dficult to want to keep riding and my butt was telling me that I was crazy to push on.Despite wanting to reach the finish as soon as possible, I had to listen to my body, and so I stopped for some food and a bit of a rest. Another quick shower, kit change and application of chamois cream, and I was ready to continue.I was joined online this time by good friends Nathan Mullan and Stephen Hanna, both from Dromara Cycling Club, and Sam Carmichael and Nigel Bradley, from my old club, Northwest CC. Seeing them there gave me a real boost and that combined with knowing I had the end in sight really spurred me on to the finish.The final  metres of climbing were the best - I was getting messages of encouragement from Zwters from places as far away as Germany, USA and Colombia. I finished shortly after pm, over  hours after I first leapt into the saddle and boy did I sleep well that night.So to finish, Irsquod like to say a huge thanks to everyone for their support, to those who donated in such hard times mdash Irsquom so grateful and Irsquom hopeful we will make le that little bit easier for others.I havenrsquot put any thought into the next challenge mdash on Sunday I said never again mdash but the beauty of cycling is therersquos always the next time.

Thatrsquos something our whole extended family embraces.ldquoItrsquos going to be bittersweet but we are happy for Mary and the lovely couple who are adopting her. Itrsquos good to know that she will be going to her forever home and will have a lovely little le. Thatrsquos always the ultimate aim for a child, particularly a younger child.ldquoHowever, one of the challenges is trying to teach her about adoption. How do you teach a three year-old that she will be leaving us and going to a forever family  We had to be creative and came up with the idea about the Christmas elf. Like many houses, we had Bauble the elf at Christmas, who was then lsquoadoptedrsquo by Mary and now lives with us all year round and is part of our family. We even made an adoption certicate to show her it was real.ldquoWhile Covid- has put a hold on this for now, we still have to prepare both Mary and ourselves, as it will be hard to say goodbye. But, as our daughter keeps saying, itrsquos part of foster care and what is right for Mary.ldquoEveryone has been writing their goodbye letters to her. We have prepared a book about her time with us and videos so that she wonrsquot have any gaps when shersquos looking back on her le.The Dicksons have been fostering since  and have looked after eight children so far, ranging in age from one to eight. They do respite fostering ndash temporary childcare for another fosterer or family ndash and short-term foster care.Itrsquos something that the couple have wanted to do for a long time.ldquoI wanted to foster for as long as in my early twenties and my husband felt the same, said  year-old Tanya. ldquoWe both came from family backgrounds where close relatives were in the caring professions.ldquoWe were very united in knowing that we would foster one day, even from the day we were married. However, when our daughter Hannah came along, we wanted her to be part of it, obviously, and to wait until the time that we were sure she understood the impact of it.ldquoWe waited until she was about  before we contacted the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. Thatrsquos where our journey started, and we havenrsquot looked back once. The Trust has been with us every step of the way. The only regret we have had about fostering is not doing it sooner.The Dicksons have also been supported by their nearest and dearest in doing something that many other people consider doing.ldquoWe were lucky that our families were always on board with us regarding our fostering, Tanya said. Our employers have been amazing, our church family and even the village family of Crossgar. Everyone has really embraced our fostering journey.After making contact with the Trust Tanya, who works at Kilmood Early Years Playgroup, said that after a period of assessment and training they began to foster six months later.ldquoI think the assessment can put people off, but I believe itrsquos an invaluable tool as you come out of it knowing yourself better, she explained. You know your own personal qualities better and your skill base.ldquoItrsquos also essential as it helps the Trust match children with dferent needs with dferent foster carers. The only thing we stipulated is that any child we cared for would be at least two years younger than Hannah as we wanted her to be the eldest child in the house.Hannah, who is a student of Saintfield High School, has been integral to the couplersquos success as foster parents and has relished her role as lsquobig sisterrsquo.Mrs Dickson said: ldquoHannah has been so great with the children. With Hannah maturing, she is showing her experience of fostering in a very positive and beautul way by showing empathy to others.ldquoThatrsquos something she would never have experienced had we not fostered and she feels more grateful for her family le. She wants to be a nurse and I can see that great caring spirit being fostered in her care of Mary. Itrsquos been so rewarding and has changed us completely for the better.Unlike many first-time parents, Tanya said foster parents always have help and support available.She said: ldquoEvery child that comes through our door is dferent and you adapt accordingly for whatever that child needs. We have the support of a link worker, who has had a lot of training. Yoursquore never on your own.ldquoWe have learnt to take things at a childrsquos pace. Some children who have been looked after before are used to being more independent and self-sufficient. You have to walk a fine line at the beginning with each child to know what they want you to do for them.The Dicksons hope to continue fostering for as long as possible and to do their best for any child that comes their way.ldquoCaring for a toddler has kept us young. You are on the ball from the crack of dawn until bedtime. I would like to think we could continue fostering for as long as we want as therersquos no age limit to fostering, she added.If you are interested in becoming a foster carer, like Tanya, or just want to find out more about what is involved, visit the HSC Northern Ireland Adoption and Foster Care website or call    to find out more.* Maryrsquos name has been changed to protect her identity..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Dean pops the question at open air gig  ","story":"A KILMORE man enlisted the help of local musician Eddie Booth when he got down on one knee to propose to his girlfriend recently.Dean Campbelland his girlfriend of ten years Laura Walters, have been big fans of Eddiersquos lsquoLive at the Lamplightrsquo gigs which he performs from his garden in Kilmore each Saturday night during the Covid- lockdown.However, unbeknown to Laura, who is a care worker for the NHS, Saturday, May , was about to become the most memorable of them all.Dean, who works for a local quarry company, says keeping the proposal a secret from Laura was the hardest thing he ever had to do.ldquoI had spoken with Laurarsquos parents, who live in England, to let them know what I was planning and arranged for them to be tuning into Eddiersquos gig via Zoom, he said.While Laura, who is also , was excited about seeing her family, she remained oblivious to the fact Eddie, was in on the delightful conspiracy.ldquoTherersquos just so much sad news around at the moment, I thought it would be a wee morale boost for the community to pop the question, so I approached Eddie to ask for his help.

Republicans are already planning a memorial on council property in Castlewellan and it is believed that loyalists in Ballynahinch may erect a memorial to dead UVF terrorists on council land at Langley Road.KILLYLEAGH ndash A new community forum, to represent the interests of a wide range of groups in the Killyleagh area, is to be set up.The umbrella organisation will represent what has been described as the ldquoimpressive level of community activity in the area.The idea to create the new group was floated at last weekrsquos annual meeting of the Killyleagh, Shrigley and District Town Committee by secretary Peter Bryson.He said the new group is vital to enable better communication and planning and help with the compilation of joint funding applications to a range of funders.He said the creation of the new group could provide the perfect  on which to develop partnerships of shared interest in the Killyleagh area.SAINTFIELD mdash As the controversy over the dangers of mobile telephone equipment continues, Saintfield residents have found themselves at the centre of the most recent debate.Parents and councillors met in the local library last week to discuss their fears of two telecommunications masts at Comber Road, which they believe are casting a shadow over the local high school.The public meeting was called by mother-of-three Laura Bill in the wake of the independent Stewart report which advises parents not to allow their children to use mobile phones, and pointed to children as being most likely to be affected by possible health risks.Leukaemia is one illness which reports have suggested could be caused, or aggravated by, radiation from mobile phone masts.One woman told Thursdayrsquos meeting that a pocket of seven children under  years of age suffer from childhood leukaemia in the Saintfield area, leading to parental fears that this could be aggravated by the existence of the masts.BALLYGOWAN mdash A shooting incident in Ballygowan during the early hours of Monday is being linked to a paramilitary feud.The house at Comber Road was sprayed with automatic gunfire by four men who smashed a number of windows. One of the weapons police believe was used in the attack was an AK  assault rle.No one was injured during the incident which is being linked to an ongoing feud between the LVF and UVF.A police spokesman confirmed yesterday the gunment made off in a white-coloured Ford Mondeo car which had a taxi sign on the roof.The vehicle drove off along the Comber Road in the village and into Comber where it was abandoned and set on fire at the rear of the Leisure Centre.Detectives investigating the incident have issued an appeal for information and want to hear from anyone who may have seen people acting suspiciously in the vicinity of the house at Ballygowan to contact them.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Members of Edengrove Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch have said farewell to the Rev Trevor Steele, who is taking up a new appointment in Ohio.Last Sunday morning, Mr Steele and his family were presented with a number of gts by the congregation to thank them for their service and contribution to the le of the church.Along with his we Carol and children Andrew and Joanna, Mr Steele is moving to the United States after accepted a call to McCord Road Congregational Church in Toledo where he begins his ministry next month.Mr Steele has been in Ballynahinch for the past five years after accepting a call to join the congregation at Edengrove while he was assistant minister at Carrickfergus Presbyterian Church.GAA mdash Peter McGrathrsquos job as Down football manager is safe, for the time being.

likely to delay the redevelopment of the huge site, traders and politicians are keen to see work starting on the eagerly-awaited economic regeneration of this historic part of the town.The local council and the Department for Communities are spearheading an ambitious regeneration project with the new brochure mdash understood to be still in draft form ndash designed to provide potential developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquospotential and secure expressions of interest.A number of Irish Street businesses have already invested in upgrading their respective shop fronts while the former police base was recently given a fresh coat of paint as part of a revitalisation scheme.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the pubic virtually.Described as a strategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential.While the imposing former police station enjoys protected status and cannot be razed to the ground, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come with an imaginative plan for the building.It has been identied as a development opportunity site in the Down Area Plan, with the area to the front included in Downpatrickrsquos conservation area.While it has been suggested that housing could form part of any redevelopment proposal, the building has been touted as a potential base for offices.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.They are keen to retain Irish Streetrsquos uniqueness where residents and traders live and work alongside each other and ensure that there is adequate parking. There have already been suggestions that an underground parking facility at the current Irish Street car park would allow retail units to be built on top.Work was recently completed on a protracted public realm scheme in Irish Street and it is hoped that the redevelopment of the former police base will complement this project, which resulted in the provision of new granite paving, street furniture and lighting.Downpatrick councillors are keen to see the redevelopment proposal increase the number of shoppers to the town to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the townrsquos economy for many years.It is also hoped to regenerate the town centrersquos night time economy with politicians eager for the Irish Street scheme to create a number of much-needed new jobs.Earlier this year, a number of Downpatrick councillors were given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear.Local council officials say they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site and had been planning to meet with them to discuss the way forward prior to the coronavirus pandemic.In addition, the local authority aims to work alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have previously expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.

Funding opportunities are being explored and while this work will also have been interrupted, I hope that it will resume in the near future.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one offering and

But, despite, a large amount of public land and pathways available to link these community assets, these attractions are poorly connected.Mr Hazzard said he has asked the local authority to ldquourgently look at rediscovering the public value of disused railway lines, abandoned riverside paths and overgrown public spaces in developing a Downpatrick greenway project that would help breath new le into redundant community infrastructure.ldquoLinking these wonderful local attractions would also help create exciting new public spaces where people can relax, enjoy nature or exercise, he continued.ldquoDelivering a greenway initiative would not only represent an exciting investment in our local tourism offering, but help create multiple, long-term employment and entrepreneurship opportunities, providing a strong  to build a much-needed, vibrant weekend and evening economy in the town centre.Mr Hazzard believes that developing greenways has the potential to make a huge dference to the lives of local people by providing the opportunity to enjoy traffic free access to fresh air and exercise.He is also confident that the initiative would encourage more workers and children to commute to work and school on foot or by bicycle and help provide a vital leisure resource for local people and visitors alike for generations to come. ldquoThe Covid- pandemic and subsequent lockdown restrictions has exposed the importance of community trails and public spaces to our collective well-being as a society, Mr Hazzard continued.ldquoOver recent weeks, our country roads and parks have been full of people seeking respite from isolation in the green, community infrastructure that ordinarily binds our communities together.However, it is clear that this infrastructure lags well behind many comparative regional, national and international locations.ldquoThankfully, however, unlike most major infrastructure projects which can be quite expensive and take the best part of a decade to complete, community green infrastructure can be delivered much quicker and at much less of a cost to the public purse.Mr Hazzard says he is confident that a new greenway project in Downpatrick represents an ldquoexciting opportunity on so many levels and deserves serious consideration.He added: ldquoI look forward to discussing this proposal with senior council management in the weeks ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/11444294.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"can grandparents babysit grandchildren latest uk government advice","story":"Can grandparents babysit their grandchildren While lockdown rules are easing, it is still prohibited for people to visit friends and family inside their homes, so allowing grandparents to babysit their grandchildren is still no longer allowed in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern IrelandCan parents access other childcare How can grandparents keep in touch with grandchildren This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That name, of a fine police force that was respected in policing circles internationally by the time it was disbanded, had to be ditched, to placate nationalists. Then the injustice of - recruitment was introduced, in which less qualied and less suited candidates from Catholic backgrounds for officer positions in the force were preferred for admission over better candidates from Protestant and other backgrounds . This persisted until Catholic levels of recruitment reached a certain level. Yet this is not now enough for nationalism. As the Catholic percentage of recruits slides, there is a fresh clamour to introduce positive discrimination, aslower Catholic levels are always the fault of everyone . \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...But not only that, now there is push to re-brand the PSNI to downplay the Northern Ireland element. Remember that this comes at a time in which republicans have been getting civil servants to use the phrase north of Ireland in documents.Such terminology de-legitimises the fact of Northern Ireland, which exists under the principle of consent in the  Belfast Agreement — yet those who roll their eyes and insist that terminology does not matter typically depict themselves as defenders of that deal.The PSNI insist that they are not trying sideline the Northern Ireland part of their name. So why are they doing it The chief constable Simon Byrne’s answer is not impressive. He says that the new logo, which bafflingly makes the Cross of St Patrick colourless and thus immediately un-recognisable, and which gets rid of the word Northern Ireland on the lower part of the crest, will “better reflect the breadth and depth of what we do and to improve our connection to our communities”.There is no need for this change. In fact we need a better explanation from the PSNI how such a plan has got far.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They decided they would do a Zoom competition instead and we thought it would be great to enter some of our teams in a way to keep spirits high, keep training, keep motivated and most importantly - have some fun.“We have been doing weekly Zoom rehearsals every Tuesday with the mini, junior and intermediate competition teams, which has been amazing. I have been brought to tears on many occasions by seeing their beautul, smiling faces that I miss so much.“As the restrictions started to relax - where you could meet six people outdoors - some of the dancers have started to meet up outside for their Tuesday Zoom classes, which has been really special for them. I still haven’t seen any of them in person yet but am very excited to.”Victoria revealed that a productive collaboration with Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council and the Riverside Theatre was key to making the event happen.The Ulster Dance Championships Zoom competition will feature Victoria Lagan dancers on Friday“I spoke to a member of the Council during a weekly FaceTime meeting I have with them regarding re-opening the studio and discussed the idea of us being able to do our Zoom competition together outdoors and they went through some of the legalities around it,” she said.“Once I realised this could be an option I contacted Roseanne Sturgeon, Manager of the Riverside Theatre, who was over the moon with the idea. She then had Megan Sheeran, who is the Technical Coordinator at the Riverside, to contact me to go through possibilities.“Megan has been such a huge help with this and has really gone above and beyond the call of duty in helping me do all the risk assessments so we could put it forward to be approved by Ulster University, Coleraine.“Thank goodness the Uni said yes! So we will be meeting on Friday outside at the back of Riverside - weather permitting - to compete in the Ulster Dance Championships via Zoom.”Victoria Lagan dancers will perform live on Zoom on FridayDancers and parents will have to adhere to a number of strict regulations to make sure the event passes off safely.Each dancer must use personal hand santisers, bring their own labelled water bottle, practice social distancing and have no physical contact at any time with other competitors or equipment.There will be security on site to check names of the children participating and only one parent per child will be allowed to spectate.First aid and fire marsahals will also be present and there will also be a special isolation room in the theatre should anyone develop symptoms.Markings on the grass outside the theatre will assist social distancing and no toilets will be in operation.Victoria added that anyone ignoring the safety measures will be asked to leave the site immediately.“It’s a lot of rules and regulations but we are eager to follow them and make this work so that we can give these kids a great day,” she added.“Our dancers are known for being well disciplined and I have the utmost faith that they will follow all regulations. Dancing means the world to these girls and I know how grateful they are to everyone at Riverside for allowing them to perform.“It’s going to be an amazing day! I know I will be bawling my eyes out start to finish watching them dance.“I am so proud of each and every one of them for putting % effort into their craft especially during these dficult times.”Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id
