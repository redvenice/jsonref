Opposite a country club, it was the biggest and \u0027flashiest\u0027 home that Meghan lived in during her youth. However, the inside was fraught with problems and was where Thomas Jr allegedly smoked weed all day, while dad Thomas Sr worked night and day           The Duchess of Sussex, here on her birthday August 4,  lived in multiple modest homes before finding fame with her role in Suits and marrying Prince HarryMeghan lived on the property until she was two years old and it was the biggest and \u0027flashiest\u0027 home she lived in during her youth.It was located opposite a country club - but the inside was fraught with problems, according to acclaimed biographer Andrew Morton, who wrote the book Meghan: A Hollywood Princess.Thomas Jr smoked weed all day and even her mother would share a joint with a neighbor, while TV lighting director Thomas worked night and day, and wild teen Samantha would be out clubbing.Doria and Thomas had married at the Self-Realization Fellowship Temple on Sunset Blvd, in a \u0027hippie wedding\u0027 in December 1979.They orced four years later and Meghan went to live with her mother in a top-floor apartment on S. Cloverdale Ave, Mid-Wilshire.It was once the garage and loft space for the main front property.This was recently renovated and is currently for rent at $3,950 a month, ten times what her mother would have been paying over 30 years previously.Although Meghan lived in modest homes, she attended a prestigious private nursery and kindergarten called Little Red Schoolhouse which starts at $18,800 a year for kindergarten and $22,600 year for sixth-grade.  After her parents orced in 1983, Meghan and her mother Doria moved into a top-floor apartment (pictured) in the Mid-Wilshire neighborhood of LA. The apartment previously served as the garage and loft space of the main front property. The Duchess of Sussex split her time here and at her father\u0027s home until she graduated high school in 1999    Meghan and Doria lived behind this two-bedroom, one bathroom house (pictured) on South Cloverdale Avenue. Their home was a short walk from Sunset Gower Studios where her father worked and where she spent time after schoolThe school was a short walk from Sunset Gower Studios where her Emmy-winning father worked on the set of Married With Children and where she would spend her days after school.Her mother Doria, 62, had a less glamorous location for her line of business, which was still only a stone\u0027s throw away from the school - now called the Hollywood Schoolhouse.She owned a gift shop called Distant Treasures and a clothing store called A Change of a Dress - both at the same location on N. La Brea St in Hancock Park for 14 years - until she went bankrupt in 2009. As can be seen in our photos, the run-down shopping precinct is now home to a liquor store, kosher market, and an aquarium, which is where Doria\u0027s shop was situated.When Meghan moved on to the $15,900-a-year Immaculate Heart High School, which she attended from 1991 to 1999, she lived with her dad on Vista Del Mar Avenue, a shabby street behind the Hollywood strip, only a few hundred yards from one of Scientology\u0027s most important buildings, founder L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition.This is where Thomas recently said in an interview that he\u0027d warned his daughter off the controversial religion after catching her lingering outside the building.Her father\u0027s apartment was on the ground floor and had two tiny bedrooms with bars across the windows.She lived there until she was 17. Now the place has been renovated, as photos show the kitchen, living room and two bedrooms that she shared with her dad throughout her teenage years.          Meghan\u0027s mother Doria, 62, previously owned a gift shop called Distant Treasures and a clothing store called A Change of a Dress - both at the same location on N. La Brea Ave in Hancock Park - just a few blocks away from Meghan\u0027s elementary school for 14 years - until she went bankrupt in 2009. The run-down shopping precinct is now home to a liquor store, kosher market, and an aquarium (pictured) which is where Doria\u0027s shop was situated          Meghan began splitting her time between her mom\u0027s house and her dad\u0027s Hollywood apartment (pictured) when she was 11 until she left for college in 1999. Thomas Sr was living in a two-bedroom ground floor flat on Vista Del Mar Avenue, a shabby street behind the Hollywood strip, only a few hundred yards from one of Scientology\u0027s most important buildings, founder L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition          Thomas Sr\u0027s apartment, pictured above with bars across the window, was a short distance to Meghan\u0027s high school. According to a biography on the duchess, \u0027it made sense for her to live with her father during the week,\u0027 however, as she got older, there was friction between the two since she felt she was the one who was mothering her father          Not so shabby: The home has since been renovated, as photos show the kitchen, living room and two bedrooms that she shared with her dad throughout her teenage years. Pictured above is the large living space of the Hollywood home   The two-bedroom, two-bath home located in the heart of Hollywood is now listed for rent. Pictured left is a renovated kitchen, while the right shows an upgraded living space with hardwood floors According to Morton\u0027s book, \u0027it made sense for her to live with her father during the week.\u0027\u0027It was a decision that would have far-reaching implications for the way she was seen by her new teachers and classmates…The older she became, the more she felt she was the one who was mothering her father. It was a source of friction, especially when she started dating,\u0027 the book states. Meghan also had various part-time jobs and volunteer work including bussing tables and serving food at the Hippie Kitchen in Downtown Los Angeles, a Catholic set up to help the homeless living in the notorious Skid Row.She was an assistant at the Paper Store in Beverly Hills, where she also taught calligraphy, and served frozen yogurt at Humphrey Yogart, in Sherman Oaks.When she left high school to attend Northwestern University in Illinois she met film producer Trevor Engelson in a bar on one of her visits back home in LA.Royal reporter claims journalists are being kept at a...Meghan Markle \u0027is at her wits\u0027 end over her father\u0027s public...Share this article \u0027When Meghan first met him on that night out in West Hollywood, she liked what she saw and was attracted to his passion, drive, and ambition.

She attended Immaculate Heart High School (pictured) on Franklin Ave in Los Angeles from the age of 11 up to 18. Tuition is now $15,900 a year          She attended a prestigious private nursery and kindergarten school called Little Red Schoolhouse, pictured, which cost $18,800 a year for kindergarten. It is now called Hollywood Schoolhouse          This is where Meghan and her first husband Trevor Engleson lived - behind Whisky A Go-Go, a notorious club on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood on Hilldale Ave during their marriage until they split in 2013. Engelson reportedly still lives there todayYet it was her childhood that defined Meghan, the aspiring actress and now adored royal. \u0027While her childhood experiences were the crucible that set her on the path to activism,\u0027 says Morton.\u0027Her mother believes that she was hardwired from birth to try to make the world a better and more equal place. In short, she had a moral compass.\u0027Despite wanting to be a Hollywood star, it was her faith that was equally important and the central pillar for Meghan and Doria. So much so, that we can disclose she was once a youth minister for the Agape International Spiritual Center, which her mum is still a member today, along with TV host Oprah Winfrey.Sharon Fox, now an executive producer at California Motion Picture Company, was also a member and told her Facebook followers about bumping into the duchess and her husband Prince Harry in Dublin earlier this month.\u0027It was such a nice surprise to bump into them when I went to Dublin to view the Book of Kells. Meghan was very sweet and I had a short chat with her during her stop on the walk about regarding our church, the Agape International Spiritual Center, and our mutual minister, Reverend Michael Bernard Beckwith... Meghan was a youth minister at my church, Agape, in LA years ago when I used to volunteer with the babies and toddlers on Church Sunday at Agape… I can not recall if I ever met her back then but it is clear she radiates that Agape spirit where ever she goes.\u0027 Her new digs: Meghan\u0027s childhood homes are a far cry from her new home in Kensington Palace (pictured)           Meghan and Harry moved into Nottingham Cottage, opposite Princess Diana\u0027s former home The Chuckle Brothers are airport assistants in ChuckleVisionDuchess of Sussex leaves Charlie van Straubenzee\u0027s weddingRoundup has three different options to kill weed in your gardenFootage shows ants build incredible bridge to raid wasps nestTravellers leave rubbish on Cobham green after eviction in MayIndonesia earthquake: scared children and parents run to safetyMen play football on M6 as motorway is closed after a crashJeremy Corbyn apologises for \u0027the hurt that has been caused\u0027Gym rage as teen attacked for lifting weights too loudSamantha Eastwood\u0027s sister and her ex-fiance bring flowers to housePrincess Eugenie arrives at wedding wearing pale blue dressBritain to swelter for two more days before heatwave eases"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/05/09/4ED8340700000578-6028155-image-a-3_1533458340151.jpg","title":"Unseen Morecambe Wise drink drive advert unearthed 50 years incredible comedy find","story":"    Eric Morecambe (left) is flinging things around his room looking for his keys so he can drive home from a party.

Gynaecology specialist Dr Safaa Ismail (left) and her husband consultant neurosurgeon Hussien Al-Maghraby (right) are alleged to have paid Miss Hemdan only £400 in five months of work after hiring her to look after their four-year-old son in 2011In addition to free board at the couple\u0027s home, she was supposed to be paid £200 per month for working eight hours per day, six days per week. Miss Hemdan claims the payments stopped after two months, earning only £400. This means she was paid less than 50p an hour for five months of work, based on a 45-hour work week.  At one point in August when she complained about the alleged conditions, Dr Safaa became \u0027furious\u0027, it is claimed.In her witness statement, Miss Hemdan said: \u0027Dr Safaa became furious and began to shout at Miss Hemdan, as she did so pushing her up the stairs.\u0027Miss Hemdan was then locked in one of the bedrooms.\u0027Miss Hemdan was told that she could come out when she apologised.\u0027She was instructed to remain in her room and did so for two days before being allowed out of the room.\u0027Miss Hemdan told the tribunal: \u0027I was in my room for two days and no one brought me any food or water.\u0027I was too frightened to leave the room as I was scared of Dr Safaa. I was able to drink water from the sink in the bathroom.\u0027She added: \u0027I was treated as a servant and often told that I was a servant.\u0027The nanny alleged to the tribunal Dr Safaa was responsible for much of the treatment.She once told Miss Hemdan \u0027that she had girls working for her before and that if they didn\u0027t like things then she sold them on\u0027, it is alleged.          Miss Hemdan said she was fed leftovers and when she complained, was locked in a bedroom  with no food and had to drink from a tap in the bathroom. She also claimed they took her passport from her and made veiled threats to sell her. Pictured: Dr Safaa Ismail on MondayMiss Hemdan said: \u0027I was shocked when she said this.\u0027I remember I said \u0027\u0027sold them\u0027\u0027, because I was so shocked, and Dr Safaa said \u0027\u0027yes\u0027\u0027 if you sell the passport the girl follows it like a dog.\u0027On another occasion, when Miss Hemdan visited the bank with the doctor, she was asked if she would be willing to sell her kidney, it is alleged.Miss Hemdan said: \u0027Dr Safaa told me that she was talking to the bank manager about her illness as she had a kidney problem.\u0027As we were leaving, Dr Safaa said to me that some people sell a kidney to another person who needs one. I did not know what to say.\u0027Dr Safaa waited a moment and then asked me what did I think about that? I answered that if someone would do it, it would be a human and good thing to do.\u0027Dr Safaa replied: \u0027\u0027Are you willing?\u0027\u0027. I said no, that I was talking in general, not about my own kidney.\u0027Dr Safaa said that she could get me £25,000 if I agreed to give \u0027\u0027us\u0027\u0027 my kidney.\u0027I believe that when she said \u0027\u0027us\u0027\u0027 she meant her and the bank manager.\u0027I said no, I could not possibly do this. I said that we do not own our kidneys, they are given to us by Allah.\u0027Miss Hemdan told the tribunal she was given an en-suite guest room in the family\u0027s loft during the stay.She said: \u0027If Dr Safaa was upset with me she would not let me sleep in my bedroom.Lilly Becker accuses family nanny of spying for estranged...Star of Chicago PD claims that a Wall Street mogul who had...Is this Meghan and Harry\u0027s manor?

I am not ignorant like you\u0027\u0027.\u0027She added: \u0027The food I was given was what was left over once the family had eaten their fill.\u0027Miss Hemdan told the tribunal she fled the house in October, when the couple moved from London to Coventry.The nanny was made to \u0027carry out the packing and moving\u0027 because professional movers were \u0027too expensive\u0027, it is alleged.She would be driven from Coventry to London \u0027twice a day\u0027 to help with the move, but one day was left at the London home while Dr Al-Meghraby went for lunch, the tribunal heard.Miss Hemdan ran away before contacting her family in Egypt, who said they had been threatened, the tribunal heard.She said: \u0027Dr Safaa had called my brother and told him that they could give someone £10,000 to have me killed.\u0027Both doctors deny all of the claims made by Miss Hemdan and said she had full access to food and living facilities.They say the nanny was paid in full before she left with \u0027no explanation\u0027.The couple stood trial in a criminal court for trafficking, false imprisonment and holding Miss Hemdan in servitude.But after two juries could not agree on a verdict they were formally cleared by a judge.Miss Hemdan is now claiming failure to provide written terms and conditions, race discrimination, failure to pay wages and failure to allow or pay her holiday leave.The tribunal was reserved for judgement at a later date."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/06/13/063CEF5B000005DC-6031377-image-a-61_1533559382553.jpg","title":"Who Iv n Duque Columbias new president revealed ahead taking office","story":"    Colombia\u0027s President Elect Iván Duque celebrates his victory in the presidential runoff electionWho is Iván Duque?Born on August 1, 1976 during a time in which Pablo Escobar’s Medellín drug cartel was at the height of power, Iván Duque grew up when cocaine rivalled extortion and kidnapping as the FARC’s (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) main source of income, as reported in TIME.Despite being raised in such tumultuous times, Duque was studious and is remembered by school friends as a reader. After studying law in Bogota, he worked for the Washington-based Inter American Development Bank, which finances development projects across Latin America.Because of his work here, Iván started to mingle in similar circles as Alvaro Uribe, the President of Colombia from 2002 to 2010, who soon became his mentor and after the President began the center-right Democratic Center Party in 2013, Duque returned to run as Senator.          Iván Duque was mentored by Alvaro Uribe,the President of Colombia from 2002 to 2010Duque’s focus soon became the peace deal struck by former President Juan Manuel Santos between the state and the FARC and while it won international praise, it proved to be isive in Colombia. TIME explained that for 50 years, around 220,000 people had been killed, millions displaced and land covered in land mines.After the peace deal, the FARC leaders walked free and as many believed, escaped justice for the crimes that they had committed. However, during Santos’ referendum, Duque campaigned against it and said: ‘My whole life, I’m a person who believes in peace, but I believe that the only way to ensure peace in any society is with the rule of law.’This opposition catapulted Duque into presidential candidacy in December 2017 and now, as President, he will need to ensure that the deal pleases the signatories, the Colombians and the rest of the world. What is clear is that Iván wants stronger sentences for FARC leaders and amnesty to be scrapped for crimes linked to the drug trade.In addition to this, Duque is for reincorporating the FARC into civilian life and said that Santos made the mistake of ‘iding Colombians between friends and enemies of peace. For me, there are no enemies, and we all want peace.’Duque is married to María Juliana Ruiz and the couple have three children Luciana, Matías and Eloísa.          Colombian president Ivan Duque and his vice-presidential running-mate Marta Lucia Ramirez2018 Columbian presidential electionWhen Iván Duque was elected as the next President of Colombia in June 2018, he told his supporters that ‘The peace we all dream of demands corrections. So that victims are the true center of the process and so that there is justice, reparations and no repetition.’Petro also drew in 8 million votes, which marked the biggest ballot box success for a leftist presidential contender in a country where those on the left have been stigmatised over fears of connections to guerrilla causes.Duque continued: ‘This is the opportunity that we have been waiting for - to turn the page on the politics of polarization, insults and venom.’ Speaking to TIME days after he was elected, Duque also suggested that he wants to move past left and right and into an era of neoliberalism.          Iván Duque will attempt to reform controversial peace deal put in place by President Santos‘I’ve always considered myself an extreme centrist. We need to have the right balance between development and environmental protection. The right balance between entrepreneurship and worker rights.‘The right balance between free markets and the ability to fix market flaws … It’s a matter of putting things in the right balance.’ In addition to fighting corruption and rising unemployment, Duque will attempt to minimise Coca production, especially after Colombia has received over $10 billion in US aid since 2000 to fight drug trafficking.After his election, he also revealed that he was open to aerial fumigation with planes to reverse the surge in Coca production. ‘At this time we have to look at all options, and they must be the ones that guarantee the most precision, the most effectiveness and that minimize any damage to third parties.’When will President Iván Duque take office?Outgoing President Juan Manuel Santos banned aerial spraying after a constitutional court ruling that found health and environmental risks. Iván Duque Márquez will take office on Tuesday, August 7, 2018 and will meet Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday, August 9.Supergirl movie in the works by Warner Bros and DCAzealia Banks calls Beyonce a \u0026#8216regular b***h\u0026#8217 who stole her choreographyMinecraft film delayed as director and writer are replacedBachelorette finale spoilers: Becca\u0027s family have concerns over Garrett in tonight\u0027s episodeDance Boss: All you need to know about Seven\u0027s new showManiac trailer: See Emma Stone and Jonah Hill in Netflix\u0027s new seriesWho is Alex Jones?

(Pictured, a brightly coloured structure in Paignton, Devon)          The arrival of seaside shelters coincided with the boom of beach holidays in the Victorian-era as Brits took advantage of the developing railway networks to flock to the beach.

The huts were still springing up in Art Deco style in the 1930s. (Pictured, a structure near the sea at Frinton-on-Sea in Essex)He said: \u0027There is nothing, quite possibly, more British than the seaside shelter - the sense it embodies of a struggle against the elements, the loneliness of a small structure outlined against the vast horizon of the sea on a rainy day and the optimism of a day out at the seaside despite the weather.\u0027These small, intimate, curious works of micro-architecture are simultaneously reminders of a very particular world view, nostalgia pods and wonderfully public places, perhaps the last architecture owned by us and open to all at any time of the day or the year.\u0027 The building of seaside shelters coincided with the boom of beach holidays in the Victorian-era as Brits took advantage of the developing railway networks to flock to the seaside.          These unique structures in Trusthorpe, Lincolnshire provide beach-goers with shelter from the unpredictable British weather in huts reminiscent of golf bunkers          This spire-like structure in Dover, Kent is a futuristic example of a seaside shelter - one of 50 photographs to be taken by Will Scott across the country in the past two years          The beach huts can even be found on the Isle of Wight, with this shelter in Shanklin standing out against a bleak backdrop of grey skies and calm seas in the vast photoset          Will said his aim wasn\u0027t to catalogue every shelter in Britain, but instead to capture the changing styles and eras of the very distinctive beach huts (Pictured, Brighton beach in East Sussex)Art Deco style structures were still springing up 1930s but the advent of World War Two was a death knell to many seaside resorts and by the 1950s they were dying out.Will has documented surviving shelters which he says retain their \u0027charm\u0027 and \u0027character\u0027 even if they have seen better days.He said: \u0027I used to holiday on the British coast as a child and I think that nostalgia drove this project, along with the fact they hadn\u0027t been documented in this way before.\u0027I started with places closer to home but then branched further afield and covered the length of breadth of the British Isles, including Scotland and Wales.           Twin beach huts were captured on the quaint Cromer Pier in Norfolk - the identical but weathered huts standing parallel to each other over calm seas          The photographer hopes his pictures will encourage communities to take care of the often run-down structures.

I pay £63,000 a year in business rates and what do I have to show for it? When I call the police, they don’t care.’Surrey Police said officers had attended the site and were investigating a series of reported thefts. In a statement, they added: ‘Most unauthorised encampments are dealt with appropriately as a civil law matter between the trespassers and the landowner.‘Legislation requires us to balance the impact of the camp with the rights of the inidual.’Mrs Mitchell, who sits on Elmbridge Borough Council, says travellers had been making unauthorised visits to Cobham for most of her time in the village. But until recently the number of caravans had been small, the arrivals infrequent and the police had swiftly moved them on.‘In the old days it was OK,’ she said. ‘The last two or three years have been awful. The response I have been having from members of the public on emails and phone calls, well, I have never in 35 years known this level of anger. They are asking why they are paying the police because they are useless. There is talk of withholding the policing precept from council tax.‘Most people in Cobham are Remain voters but now some are saying what we need is a Donald Trump in this country. They would not have said that a year ago.’While many other affluent towns report similar problems, in Cobham the past 12 months has seen an almost constant battle between travellers and locals. Last summer a large group of travellers arrived on a field known as Leg O’Mutton.‘There were maybe about 60 vans on there and the travellers rode quad bikes over the football pitches,’ Mrs Mitchell said. ‘They destroyed the goal posts and broke all the glass in the neighbouring community garden and stole equipment and money from the shed.’ The edge of the area was used as a lavatory and an old van was left behind on the site, with the council facing a clean-up bill of several thousand pounds.Earlier this year, travellers invaded Sainsbury’s car park. There were incidents of shoplifting, one customer was bitten by a traveller’s dog, the supermarket’s cafe was closed for the duration and there was a major impact on sales. Sainsbury’s has since erected a height barrier to prevent caravans entering the car park.          Officers were photographed apparently clearing human waste from tennis courts‘Sainsbury’s are in a better position than ourselves because they are private landowners and can get bailiffs in far quicker than we can for public land,’ Mrs Mitchell said. She says travellers send in others to break down the gates so when they move in they can claim the site was already open.‘Unless we pay security guards 247, which we can’t afford, there is very little we can do to stop them,’ she said. ‘Most of the incursions are happening next to people who are not living in the large, expensive houses. They are affecting the ordinary population, stopping mothers with small children who want to use a safe play area.’During the late May bank holiday, travellers took over the car park at Painshill, an award-winning garden. It had to be closed during one of the most lucrative weekends of the year. When bailiffs evicted them, the travellers simply broke into a council-owned field next door.In June they arrived on Cobham Recreation Field. After they were evicted, the children’s play area had to be closed and specialist cleaners hired. It had just reopened when they returned last week.A few days ago, the council evicted French travellers who had camped in a field of cherry trees planted as a war memorial.Last Tuesday the latest travellers were issued with a notice to leave by Elmbridge Council. On Friday, Guildford magistrates took eight minutes to grant the local authority’s application to have 32 caravans and 35 other vehicles evicted from Cobham Recreation Field.None of the travellers attended court but their leader, Martin Casey, said: ‘Magistrates should do a bit more thinking about where we are going to go, not just signing everything the council tell them to. We’ve nowhere to go, we leave this park and now we have to look for another park in the next town.‘They are pushing us on like cattle all over the place.’That they have left – for now – will come as some relief to residents. But how long the peace will last over a long, hot summer remains to be seen. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/06/09/4EDED57A00000578-0-image-m-43_1533544846065.jpg","title":"Language phrasebook obsolete according British Council","story":"    More than 60 per cent of 16 to 34-year-olds said they had used their smartphone apps to help boost their understanding of the local language while abroad – but only 39 per cent opted for a phrasebook (file photo)It also found that for many boozy Britons the most important phrase to know is \u0027Dos cervezas, por favor\u0027, with more than one in four UK adults saying they learnt how to ask for two beers, or other drinks, in the local language.\u0027Please\u0027 and \u0027Thank you\u0027 the most common words learned by holidaymakers, followed by Hello\u0027 and \u0027Goodbye\u0027 at 69 per cent.But there are also signs that many Britons are simply learning how to express their lack of foreign language skills, with more than one in four  teaching themselves to say \u0027Do you speak English?\u0027 and 16 per saying they learnt to say: \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t speak the language.\u0027As temperatures in Europe soar to 46C, Met Office...Share this articleJust over a fifth said they did not learn any words or phrases, despite three in four  agreeing that it is important to learn a few phrases.Vicky Gough, schools adviser at the British Council, said: \u0027It\u0027s fantastic that so many of us are ready to give foreign languages a go to make the most of our holidays, and smartphone technology can be a great first step in getting directions and basic information.\u0027However, this technology has its limits and can\u0027t replicate the linguistic and cultural nuances of conversation.

I pay £63,000 a year in business rates and what do I have to show for it? When I call the police, they don’t care.’Surrey Police said officers had attended the site and were investigating a series of reported thefts. In a statement, they added: ‘Most unauthorised encampments are dealt with appropriately as a civil law matter between the trespassers and the landowner.‘Legislation requires us to balance the impact of the camp with the rights of the inidual.’Mrs Mitchell, who sits on Elmbridge Borough Council, says travellers had been making unauthorised visits to Cobham for most of her time in the village. But until recently the number of caravans had been small, the arrivals infrequent and the police had swiftly moved them on.‘In the old days it was OK,’ she said. ‘The last two or three years have been awful. The response I have been having from members of the public on emails and phone calls, well, I have never in 35 years known this level of anger. They are asking why they are paying the police because they are useless. There is talk of withholding the policing precept from council tax.‘Most people in Cobham are Remain voters but now some are saying what we need is a Donald Trump in this country. They would not have said that a year ago.’While many other affluent towns report similar problems, in Cobham the past 12 months has seen an almost constant battle between travellers and locals. Last summer a large group of travellers arrived on a field known as Leg O’Mutton.‘There were maybe about 60 vans on there and the travellers rode quad bikes over the football pitches,’ Mrs Mitchell said. ‘They destroyed the goal posts and broke all the glass in the neighbouring community garden and stole equipment and money from the shed.’ The edge of the area was used as a lavatory and an old van was left behind on the site, with the council facing a clean-up bill of several thousand pounds.Earlier this year, travellers invaded Sainsbury’s car park. There were incidents of shoplifting, one customer was bitten by a traveller’s dog, the supermarket’s cafe was closed for the duration and there was a major impact on sales. Sainsbury’s has since erected a height barrier to prevent caravans entering the car park.          Officers were photographed apparently clearing human waste from tennis courts‘Sainsbury’s are in a better position than ourselves because they are private landowners and can get bailiffs in far quicker than we can for public land,’ Mrs Mitchell said. She says travellers send in others to break down the gates so when they move in they can claim the site was already open.‘Unless we pay security guards 247, which we can’t afford, there is very little we can do to stop them,’ she said. ‘Most of the incursions are happening next to people who are not living in the large, expensive houses. They are affecting the ordinary population, stopping mothers with small children who want to use a safe play area.’During the late May bank holiday, travellers took over the car park at Painshill, an award-winning garden. It had to be closed during one of the most lucrative weekends of the year. When bailiffs evicted them, the travellers simply broke into a council-owned field next door.In June they arrived on Cobham Recreation Field. After they were evicted, the children’s play area had to be closed and specialist cleaners hired. It had just reopened when they returned last week.A few days ago, the council evicted French travellers who had camped in a field of cherry trees planted as a war memorial.Last Tuesday the latest travellers were issued with a notice to leave by Elmbridge Council. On Friday, Guildford magistrates took eight minutes to grant the local authority’s application to have 32 caravans and 35 other vehicles evicted from Cobham Recreation Field.None of the travellers attended court but their leader, Martin Casey, said: ‘Magistrates should do a bit more thinking about where we are going to go, not just signing everything the council tell them to. We’ve nowhere to go, we leave this park and now we have to look for another park in the next town.‘They are pushing us on like cattle all over the place.’That they have left – for now – will come as some relief to residents. But how long the peace will last over a long, hot summer remains to be seen. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/06/09/4EDED57A00000578-0-image-m-43_1533544846065.jpg","title":"Language phrasebook obsolete according British Council","story":"    More than 60 per cent of 16 to 34-year-olds said they had used their smartphone apps to help boost their understanding of the local language while abroad – but only 39 per cent opted for a phrasebook (file photo)It also found that for many boozy Britons the most important phrase to know is \u0027Dos cervezas, por favor\u0027, with more than one in four UK adults saying they learnt how to ask for two beers, or other drinks, in the local language.\u0027Please\u0027 and \u0027Thank you\u0027 the most common words learned by holidaymakers, followed by Hello\u0027 and \u0027Goodbye\u0027 at 69 per cent.But there are also signs that many Britons are simply learning how to express their lack of foreign language skills, with more than one in four  teaching themselves to say \u0027Do you speak English?\u0027 and 16 per saying they learnt to say: \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t speak the language.\u0027As temperatures in Europe soar to 46C, Met Office...Share this articleJust over a fifth said they did not learn any words or phrases, despite three in four  agreeing that it is important to learn a few phrases.Vicky Gough, schools adviser at the British Council, said: \u0027It\u0027s fantastic that so many of us are ready to give foreign languages a go to make the most of our holidays, and smartphone technology can be a great first step in getting directions and basic information.\u0027However, this technology has its limits and can\u0027t replicate the linguistic and cultural nuances of conversation.

Twitter has not confirmed this.Jayes said the comment proved that Cottrell was not only a “fascist” but was also “dangerous”.Cottrell said he had been banned from Sky and other media platforms because he was “too articulate”.Sky hosted Cottrell, a carpenter and bodybuilder, in its Melbourne studio for a one-on-one discussion about immigration on Sunday night, tweeting his 10-minute rant about immigration based on race and his preference for white South African farmers to fill the migration quota.The leader of the United Patriots Front, a far-right nationalist group, has a criminal history that includes being found guilty last year of inciting contempt, revulsion or ridicule of Muslims. The bodybuilder and carpenter has also claimed to have manipulated women “using violence and terror”, and previously said he wanted a portrait of Hitler in every school classroom.Sky has suspended Giles’s program and shaken up its management structure in the wake of the outcry. At least one major company has withdrawn its advertisements from Sky News following Cottrell’s appearance, while the former Labor minister Craig Emerson quit his role as a network commentator."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cc9a39eefc984aa72376a5cde8293012b334151/0_17_2505_1503/master/2505.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be5fa2e6dd3750ab6dceca62a394b5c2","title":"brian catling the vorrh interview","story":"When his biblical fantasy The Vorrh came out to rave reviews, the artist became an acclaimed debut – at 61. As the epic trilogy ends a decade on, Catling talks about teaming up with Terry Gilliam, being adopted and the nastiest depths of his imaginationIn the middle of a manicured garden tucked away in a courtyard within the Royal Academy, Brian Catling has his fingers in his mouth. “I can give you a bit of, well – something,” he says to the photographer, around the digits – and begins scrabbling at his fleshy cheeks, teeth gnashing and eyes rolling. His gigantic hands pull at the jowls with such force that his arms begin to shake, as if his very skin can no longer contain him.The camera snaps. Two ladies drinking Campari nearby watch all this something with great interest. “Are you Brian Catling?” one of them asks. The enormous hands let go suddenly the monster is gone and just the man is left, beaming as he straightens his suit.A bit of face-squashing is all in a day’s work for Catling. Whether it is sculpture, performance, painting, poetry or novels, his work has always possessed an otherworldly weirdness not unlike someone pulling a grotesque face, as if reality has been scooped up and plonked a step to the left, where everything is familiar but shows a different aspect. His innocuous appearance – besuited, sixtysomething, white guy – is a tool he uses, often to confrontational, alarming effect. His performance Mr Rapehead saw him enter a gallery, disguised to the chattering crowds as just another bloke perusing the art – until he began strapping (and setting off) rape alarms on his face. In other shows, he has wandered around busy galleries while wearing a convincing cyclops prosthetic, prompting a ripple of flinches from unsuspecting art lovers.A decade ago, Catling was quietly respected in the art world. Then he began writing what he thought would be an 150-page novella it turned out to be The Vorrh, the first volume of a 1,500-page fantasy trilogy. Heaving with biblical myth (and Old Testament levels of blood and gore) as well as art and science, the novel is named after the sentient, semi-tropical African forest that looms at the heart of the trilogy. Picking up just after the first world war, the story begins as colonisers hear tales that the forest is home to the Garden of Eden. Too bad that its also home to cyclopses, angels, and Adam and Eve – bestial creatures who roam the trees. Oh, and almost everyone who ventures in goes mad.“I thought The Vorrh would be a book that someone finds on a shelf in 10 years’ time, brushes the dust off and says: ‘Oh, this is quite an interesting thing.’ Because they’re the only books I read!” Catling says, wheezing with laughter.But The Vorrh, while rich with esotericism, was not that book. One critic likened it to “Gormenghast, reimagined by Alan Moore on opium” Moore himself has called it “a phosphorescent masterpiece”. And when it came out in 2012, it won raves from the likes of Michael Moorcock, Tom Waits and Terry Gilliam, making Catling an acclaimed debutant at the age of 61. Two sequels followed: The Erstwhile, which left Africa to venture down the dark alleyways of east London, Catling’s childhood home. And now the finale: The Cloven, which sees the forest, displeased with years of pillaging, take on the incoming Nazis.Catling, by his own admission, has always been a weird guy. But not many oddballs have the imagination to create a world with entirely new branches of biology, ecology and religious myth, while also imbuing this with an earthiness that makes it all almost believable. “The imagination is a muscle, one that increases with exercise. You have to tell it, ‘That’s not good enough, you’ve got to go further,’” he says. “I’ve always wanted more than one life. Inventing fiction, performing, they’re all ways of being someone else. I feel so stupid that it took me this long to realise that I could do this in words, too. I can redefine gravity, simply because I say so.”He recalls meeting the main character of his next book: a girl called Mia, who approached his bed one morning and showed him her teeth, which were made of frozen saliva. “Of course, that never happened. I didn’t see her,” he says, then sits forward, eyes bulging. “But I did! That’s what happens when you push the imagination far enough. That’s why I’ve never done drugs.” Really? “Everyone thinks I’m up to my neck, but I have enough trouble with my imagination as it is. Losing or amplifying it scares the life out of me. Alcohol is like wearing an overcoat on your head. I’ll save drugs for old age.”His voice is simultaneously gravelly and breathy, philosophical and gruff. Afterwards, when he sneaks me into the Royal Academy’s summer show, he becomes almost bashful when we find a stream of stickers indicating sales next to one of his prints. (“Don’t know what they’re doing there,” he says, giving the wall a rap of his knuckles.)When people approach him, he says, many are unable to pair the affable man in front of them with the twisted mind that could create visions such as the trilogy’s opening scene, where a man fashions a bow from his dead wife’s spinal cord. Even he’s not too sure. “That’s about as nasty as it gets,” he says when I bring up a scene in The Vorrh that stars a reanimated aborted foetus. I had a nightmare about it, I admit, and he looks thrilled. “Did you?” he beams, sitting back as if ingesting a particularly rich meal. “How wonderful, how wonderful,” he murmurs.Catling speaks with a stammer when he is stuck on a syllable, his face freezes in a rictus not far from one of his own performances. He also has dyslexia and was adopted, a set of trials he calls “the full set”. His working-class adoptive parents, despite opposition from relatives, encouraged him to go to college. “But still, there has always been this other thing driving it all,” he says. The “thing” is his natural affiliation with the grotesque, the shocking, the bizarre: “There is nothing to explain my imagination. I assume it is hereditary, I just don’t know what else it could be.” He never looked for his parents. “It was only curiosity and I don’t think that’s enough to knock on someone’s door and say, ‘Hey! Guess who I am!’ But maybe it all came from that – you don’t know who you are, so you invent it. And if you can invent one life, you can invent two.”After finishing at the Royal College of Art in his 20s, he made a concerted decision to not “make a living” from art and went into teaching instead. He is now an emeritus professor at Oxford’s Ruskin School of Art. “I wanted to have the freedom in my life to experiment,” he says. “I made installations that only existed for the run of the show, and then they’d go in a skip. People couldn’t believe I wasn’t selling them. It wasn’t a moral or political stance, I just wanted to make things that only existed in people’s memory.” If he’d become a commercial artist, he would have felt trapped, he says. “Art has not provided me with a living, because I haven’t let it.”Hollywood may soon provide an extra boon: Gilliam is currently attempting to get The Vorrh on screen. “The problem is, film producers want you to sum it up in one page,” Catling groans. “They haven’t got patience to read the thing. They say, ‘What is it? What does it do?’ Those questions are a blank wall to me.”In the meantime, he continues to work at such a rate that even he barely knows what he’s got on the go. A quartet of wild west stories. A novel due out next year called Earwig (already being adapted for film). A novel called Hollow, which he describes as “Sam Peckinpah meets Bruegel”. And three books about London.Isn’t living with his imagination, constantly needing to find avenues for it, exhausting? “No. Perhaps I’ve been waiting. Sixty-one is pretty late to start writing prose. I feel like I don’t have enough time left. I’m talking about things I’ve not even started on. It’s just there,” he says, waving one of those huge hands vaguely at his forehead. “I think I’m lazy most of the time. I should be writing more. The work is coming out of me in all different ways – but it always has. And apart from being run over by a bus, it is just going to go on.”• The Cloven is published by Coronet, priced £20, and is available from the  bookshop for £17 including free UK p\u0026ampp. • Brian Catling will be talking about The Cloven at Foyles Charing Cross Road in London on 3 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb773cfdfa8a80af0d6a314cdd8028b89a79e0cf/0_79_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=999ae4f44336241c6259d6dafdf3ddc4","title":"convenience store woman sayaka murata review","story":"This deadpan Japanese tale of an oddball shop assistant possesses a strange beautyNot all novel titles manage so very literally to describe the contents, but this one – unapologetically deadpan yet enticingly comic – absolutely does. Keiko has been a worry to her family all her life, bullied and friendless, her behaviour sometimes even chilling. At school she bashes a boy over the head with a shovel to stop him fighting. Another time she asks her mother if she can eat a dead budgie found in the park.Her salvation appears when, aged 18, she secures herself a job at the local Smile Mart convenience store and, paying conscientious attention to the training video, realises “it was the first time anyone had ever taught me how to accomplish a normal facial expression and manner of speech”. Discovering that she excels at the daily monotone of restocks and product promotions and difficult customers, Keiko finds contentment and self-respect among the brightly lit aisles and hot food cabinets. Now part of the “machine of society” and revelling in the newfound safety and comfort of her job, she reckons she’s at long last “pulled off being a ‘person”’.But now Keiko is 36 years old and her family still isn’t happy. Concerned that she’s hurtling towards a childless middle age in a dead-end job, they hanker to “fix” her, begging her to get some therapy or, better still, find a husband. Enter Shiraha, a lazy, feckless and resoundingly truculent convenience store colleague who is soon fired, only to be rescued by Keiko who takes pity on him.He tells her that he wants to find a wife to finance him. “You lot have a cushy time of it,” he says, adding that in his view nothing has changed since the stone age: “people who don’t fit into the village are expelled: men who don’t hunt, women who don’t give birth to children”.Nothing about Shiraha is attractive and his arguments don’t remotely add up, but nevertheless Keiko has an idea that might help them both “fit in”. She tells him he can move in with her and she will provide his “feed” and keep him “hidden from society” and all its demands. In return, his very presence in her home will encourage people to view her as normal. “It appears that if a man and a woman are alone in an apartment together, people’s imaginations run wild and they’re satisfied regardless of the reality,” she observes.Shiraha is quick to see her point. “Everyone will assume you’re a sexually active, respectable human being. That’s the image of you that pleases them most. Isn’t it wonderful?” Though he is charmingly quick to reassure her that “there’s no chance of me ever penetrating a woman like you”.This, Murata’s 10th novel, has been a big hit both in Japan and worldwide, and it isn’t hard to see why. It’s not flawless: Shiraha seems to be more of a plot enabler than fully realised character and, though Murata’s gloriously nutty deadpan prose and even more nuttily likable narrator are irresistible, I’d have liked more on her latent psychopathic streak. The moment when, as her sister comforts her crying baby, Keiko eyes the cake knife on the table and thinks “if it was just a matter of making him quiet, it would be easy enough” is sublimely weird but, for my money, never really earned or followed up.But these are minor quibbles and perhaps even missing the point. For it’s the novel’s cumulative, idiosyncratic poetry that lingers, attaining a weird, fluorescent kind of beauty all of its own. The world of the store with its dented cans and rice balls and barcodes and scanners, and Keiko’s shivery, unashamedly sensual response as a “convenience store animal” who can “hear the store’s voice telling me what it wanted, how it wanted to be”. The book’s title is more than perfect, for this, you soon realise, is a love story.

Food sales had their best July in five years, while fans and cooling equipment flew off the shelves.“However, total sales growth slowed as the heat laid bare the underlying weakness in consumer spending. Sales of non-food products struggled. Three months into an extended period of summer weather, demand for many seasonal purchases has slowed while the heat has kept shoppers away from days spent browsing new ranges. For many in the industry, autumn could not come sooner.”“Although changing consumer behaviour means we will have fewer shops in future, the reality is that if we want to support a positive reinvention of our high streets, business rates cannot go on increasing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae53bc435f862bf60431dc1edeaf1252ff5e663a/0_30_1754_1052/master/1754.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1a503ea133b2594ba49ba6ffd76ef65","title":"wonga loans where did it all go wrong","story":"Pressure from claims management firms and regulators could bring an end to the deflating payday lenderJust when things were meant to be getting better for Wonga, it emerged at the weekend that the payday lender’s investors had to rescue it with a £10m capital injection.The emergency fundraising is the latest episode in Wonga’s rapid rise and fall. Just six years after the company was touted for a flotation that would have valued it at more than $1bn (£770m), it is reported to be worth just $30m.But political pressure started to build against payday lenders as stories emerged of vulnerable customers struggling to repay. Though Wonga claimed its customers were web-savvy people who chose not to use big banks, the  found hard-pressed borrowers unable to gain credit elsewhere.Wonga’s profit tripled in 2011 to £45.8m on revenues of £185m as the company made 2.5m loans. But then, in 2013, came a regulatory clampdown as the Office for Fair Trading ordered payday lenders to clean up their businesses and the Financial Conduct Authority announced a cap on the total cost of a loan.Chief executive and co-founder Errol Damelin quit in November 2013 and left the company seven months later. Andy Haste, the former chief executive of FTSE 100 insurer RSA, joined as chair and pledged to improve business practices, while making Wonga smaller and less profitable.Haste drafted in a new management team, led by chief executive Tara Kneafsey, to rebuild the company. Wonga reported losses of £80m in 2015 and £66m in 2016 but was aiming to return to profit in 2017. With its accounts due to appear in the next couple of months, that goal now looks highly unlikely.Wonga has been hit by an unexpected surge in customer compensation claims linked to loans it made before 2014. That year, an FCA crackdown prompted Haste to write off £220m in debts and interest for 330,000 customers.But claims management firms that are targeting payday lenders have set off a renewed torrent of complaints. Figures from the Financial Ombudsman show complaints about Wonga leaping to 2,347 in the second half of 2017, from just 269 two years earlier.The ombudsman is also reportedly giving borrowers more time to bring cases, putting further pressure on Wonga. The result is a big enough jump in provisions for customer compensation to threaten the company’s survival.James Daley, managing director of campaign group Fairer Finance, said: “It’s not surprising that Wonga are in this position because they exploited a market that was loosely regulated. They were in the vanguard of giving people quick access to credit with high prices and high fees and they didn’t treat their customers well.”Claims management companies have targeted payday lenders as potential payouts from payment protection insurance start to dwindle. PPI customers have a year left to make complaints before the FCA’s deadline. Wonga received almost 1,000 more claims in the second half of 2017 than in the first half.Balderton Capital, Accel Partners and 83 North, who stumped up cash in the emergency fundraising, were among the investors that backed it early on. Damelin has moved on to become one of the UK’s leading investors in technology startups, including Purple Bricks, the online estate agent.“As I understand it, they’ve done their best to clean their act up, but they are reaping what they sowed in those early years,” said Daley. “When Wonga was in the market they were making money and now they are handing it all back again.”Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “We now see half the number of payday loan problems that we did in the dark days before the cap on interest and charges, so we know this type of regulation works. While many of these problems are from before 2015, people still come to us after being sold loans they cannot pay back because rules on affordability are simply not good enough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/313e7da6dbf6d6c6674d533f75cefc283087e2f5/0_350_5243_3145/master/5243.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4aa110ede66c5676754e782d63844f7d","title":"cairo redevelopment plan calls time on egypts oldest watch shop","story":"Loss of heritage buildings and inadequate compensation spark outrage as bulldozers raze area associated with Arab springAfter 111 years of tinkering and fixing, Essam Ahmed can’t bring himself to acknowledge the demise of what may well be the oldest watch shop in Egypt. He shows off an alarm clock his father fixed for the last monarch, King Farouk, and a ledger with neat handwriting that meticulously records the names of every customer who has come into the shop, including prominent Egyptian personalities from the 20th century such as feminist activist Hoda Al Shaarawi and actor Naguib Al Rihani.“This place is still alive for us,” he says. “It’s my home and it is being taken away from us by brute force.”He learned his craft from his father and his grandfather, who bought the shop, Hinhayat, from its original Bulgarian owner, Solomon Hinhayat, in 1956. But by the end of this week, the shop will be gone – demolished as part of a huge urban redevelopment plan in Cairo, known as the Maspero Triangle.Close to the River Nile and surrounded by historic buildings including the Italian consulate and the labyrinthine Radio \u0026amp Television Building, the 35-hectare Maspero Triangle district will involve a new financial centre, luxury hotels and malls.Demolition and relocation costs are estimated at four billion Egyptian pounds (£170m). Tenders for construction firms to rebuild the area have not yet been put forward. The area was a key flashpoint during the Arab spring, with protracted clashes between protesters and the army. In October 2011, tanks mowed down 29 Coptic Christian demonstrators during the Maspero massacre,a turning point for the revolution..Now the bulldozers are moving in – and erasing a host of Kheial buildings, which meld Arab and European motifs. Under Ottoman ruler Khee Ismail in the mid-nineteenth century, Cairo was modernised with architecture that featured elegant decoration and neo-classical columns –\u0026nbspexemplified by buildings such as Cairo’s first opera house, which burned down in 1971.Critics of the latest modernisation plans say Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, is looking to turn Cairo into a lucrative playground for wealthy investors and tourists while potentially displacing up to 18,000 residents in Maspero. A new administrative capital in the desert is already under construction, powered by Chinese developers such as State Construction Engineering Corporation and China Fortune Land Development, which have invested around $20bn (£15bn).The Maspero redevelopment is part of a wider plan to redesign downtown Cairo. Named after the French archaeologist Gaston Maspero, who conducted excavation work on the Sphinx at Giza and headed the Egyptian Museum, the redevelopment contract was awarded to architecture firm Foster and Partners, which boasted in its glossy winning bid in November 2015: “The future of Maspero burns bright, and we are sure our sustainable model of development will set the benchmark for urban regeneration throughout the country.”But for Ahmed and many other residents in the area, the destruction of buildings on one side of 26 July Street – including his watch shop – represents a dark end to a majestic era – not to mention his main source of income.“It’s worth millions and they (the authorities) want to give us pennies,” Ahmed says. “But more importantly, it should be left as a museum. We served kings and celebrities and this is what Hinhayat’s legacy has been reduced to. How can a proud country kill its heritage with its own hands?”Demolition has already begun. Bulldozers have started knocking buildings down and workers dump wheelbarrows of rocks in plumes of suffocating dust. Hashem Abu El Ela, 55, a loyal customer who lives in a heritage building nearby takes a more defiant tone.“They are killing us slowly. A slow torturous death to squeeze us out of the area,” he says. “This is our home and come hell or high water, we won’t go.”He says authorities are offering 60,000 EGP per room to every resident across the area. Others add that compensation has not been paid out even though they were approved to receive the funds before being forced to evacuate.Ahmed was offered 7,000 EGP per square metre to vacate the watch shop, well below the market price of 50,000-100,000 EGP per square metre according to local real estate brokers. El Ela’s friends took the money and moved elsewhere, leaving him to chase lawyers and send letters to local officials pleading his case. An administrative court hearing is scheduled for end of this month.Residents have also been offered 40,000 EGP for relocations costs. Property prices have boomed on the back of the devaluation of the currency, which bodes well for investors and second home-buyers. Buying new apartments in an area close to Maspero, such as Imbaba in southern Cairo close to the banks of the Nile, though, would set back a buyer at least 300,000 EGP. In addition, living costs have soared after Egypt agreed to undertake austerity measures to secure a $12bn loan from the International Monetary Fund.The Informal Settlements Development Fund, the government agency behind the Maspero plans, says it has a responsibility to get rid of buildings that are residentially unsafe, including the Hinhayat building.“We want a successful fabric of urban and social cohesion,” says Khaled El Seddiq, the head of the agency. “Maspero Triangle is one of the biggest slums in Egypt, where there have been plenty of cases of urban decay and untenable living situations because of human density.”El Seddiq noted that the final amount of compensations is estimated to reach 1.3 billion EGP to more than 4,500 families.Asked whether buildings and shops with significant cultural heritage, such as Hinhayat, would be protected, he adds: “If I am opening up a new corridor that will serve one million pedestrians daily, and I have a heritage building – which is more important for me? The public good is always better. Safety of people comes first. And to be honest, I don’t see any form of architectural heritage in these buildings.” There are broader concerns that Egypt’s urban vision is creating spatial and class inequalities.“The government is using informal settlements as a quick way to make some cash by exploiting the rent gap,” says Yahia Shawkat, co-founder of 10 Tooba, a Cairo-based think tank focused on the built environment. “The difference between the cost of eviction and expropriation is low, and the investmentresale value of the empty land is high.”Outside Hinhayat, mounds of broken stone and concrete send clouds of dust into the air as residents pick their way through the street. For Ahmed, simply packing up the hundreds of precious watches and clocks has been an emotionally laborious task.“I still can’t accept that this all coming to end,” he says. “Look at the rubble outside the shop. This is what we’ve become as a state.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83d2a7994a57fb1c3279fa4cf815e8671da94e9a/0_72_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e865fb425f1fbfb1463de3601ccd8556","title":"online conspiracy theory journalism qanon","story":"The QAnon narrative shows the need for better practices in reporting on baseless claims and hoaxes. Here’s how the media can take actionAt a certain point, it became impossible not to talk about QAnon.For readers not yet familiar with the story, QAnon is a conspiracy theory centering on a figure calling themselves Q, who has for months made outrageous and unsubstantiated claims about and allegedly from within the Trump administration. Robert Muller, Hillary Clinton, and many others have figured into the pro-Trump narrative, to the extent that Q’s cryptic proclamations – which began on 4chan in late 2017 and later migrated to 8chan and parts of Reddit – could be described as a traditional narrative.Over the last year, the QAnon conspiracy theory has generated intermittent bursts of coverage. What had been a simmering narrative became a fireworks factory explosion on 1 August, when some attendees of a Trump campaign-style rally in Tampa, Florida, showed up carrying “Q” signs. According to Joan Donovan, research lead at Data \u0026amp Society’s Media Manipulation Initiative, this appears to have been a coordinated effort to grab reporters’ attention.It worked. Suddenly, news organizations began clamoring for information. What was QAnon? How could such a false and ridiculous narrative become so popular with so many people? What did we miss?The resulting coverage can be ided into three basic categories: explainers, which don’t just e into the intricacies of the conspiracy, but often include a glossary of key terms hair-on-fire warnings about how dangerous and frightening the conspiracy is and smug declarations that of course Trump supporters believe in something so stupid. As Abby Ohlheiser has noted, the tone and breakneck frequency of this coverage was immediately uproarious to participants, a great victory for what their supporters call the “great awakening”, often delivered with a characteristically trollish wink.The networked coordination of participants, cycle after cycle of mainstream coverage, and participants’ subsequent raucous laughter show that while the QAnon narrative itself might be confusing and convoluted, the coverage surrounding the QAnon narrative has been distressingly predictable. The story has advanced like clockwork.I have been studying the gears of this mechanism for the last 10 years, beginning with my research into subcultural trolling on and around 4chan’s “b” board, at the time the site’s most infamous and active board (that title has since been usurped by 4chan’s pol board).The primary focus of this work was the symbiotic relationship between participating trolls and the news media: the fact that trolls needed journalists to amplify their attacks (and they found the reporting funny), and some journalists needed trolls to give them sensational things to write about.The troll space has shifted in profound and striking ways over time (as I and my co-authors have previously argued). Participants on sites such as 4chan and 8chan have too you can’t draw a perfectly straight line between trolling of the past and far-right extremism of the present.That said, many journalistic responses to trollish media manipulation tactics have remained constant. What this coverage has always done is incentivize precisely the behaviors it purports to condemn. In the process, it ensures that the same tactics will be used in the future – because the tactics are proven to work.The question before us is this: how can we all do this better, so that we are not, once again, forced to comment on stories like QAnon? How do we not paint ourselves into that same old corner?I lay out a number of better practices – for establishing newsworthiness for reporting on objectively false information, coordinated manipulation campaigns, bigots, and abusers – in my recently published Data \u0026amp Society report The Oxygen of Amplification. The following is an overview of the primary takeaways from that work.The first strategy is, most basically, not to report on things – at least not until the stories reach what Claire Wardle and Hossein Derakhshan have identified as the “tipping point”, when the story becomes relevant to people outside the community in which the behavior occurs.The second strategy, particularly important when covering hate, is to employ what Donovan and danah boyd describe as “strategic silence”. Just because a group does or says something doesn’t mean it bears repeating. There are other factors to consider before reporting, most notably what impact the coverage will have on the targets of the potential story’s subjects, whether that impact is further intimidation, dehumanization, or physical harm.Coverage isn’t just about the coverage itself, in other words. How and whether to cover a story must also hinge on what the story might do, and whose interests it will ultimately serve.In the case of QAnon, debunking and explainer stories can be interesting and helpful for readers who already believe the conspiracy is absurd they provide those readers more information, greater contextual understanding, and a richer vocabulary for describing something they already know.For other audiences, however, attempts to debunk and explain the intricacies of the story can have a very different impact. First, the people spreading the conspiracy couldn’t ask for a better outcome journalists covering the story help spread the narrative so much further and so much faster than it would have traveled otherwise. Participants in the QAnon narrative have giddily affirmed exactly this point posts to the “Great Awakening” subreddit have outrightly thanked journalists for the coverage and for the resulting wave of new participants.More concerningly, for those who sincerely believe the conspiracy to be true, or for those who may not be true believers but who do truly mistrust mainstream journalism, debunkings can actually serve to confirm the story – a logically valid conclusion to draw if someone believes that everything journalists say is a lie. (For more on this head-spinning complication, see Alice Marwick’s exploration of why people share false narratives, and Francesca Tripodi’s analysis of “alternative facts” and news sources within conservative political thought).Beyond asking what impact a story might have, journalists must ask what is not known about the story, and how this lack of knowledge undermines clear-headed threat assessments.For example, the overwhelming majority of QAnon coverage has taken for granted that the people who participate in the QAnon narrative believe the narrative. Some sure seem to. But in an environment ruled by Poe’s law, an online axiom stating that sincerity online is often indistinguishable from satire, it is not possible to know who is genuinely sold on the narrative, who is pretending to be sold to mess with reporters, and who is doing a little bit of both.By operating on the unchallenged, unquestioning assumption that everyone who holds the proverbial or literal “Q” sign is fully convinced of the conspiracy’s veracity, reporters don’t just help spread the narrative, they lend credence to it. After all, taking the narrative so seriously signals that it is in fact worth taking seriously. Reporters’ credulous coverage also feeds into a range of unintended narratives. For those who are actively engaged in media manipulation, it underscores’ journalists gullibility and exploitability (and is very funny to participants). For those who believe the narrative sincerely, it affirms that QAnon adherents are really on to something otherwise mainstream journalists wouldn’t be in such a panic.The final question reporters must ask themselves stems from the fact that journalists aren’t just part of the game of media manipulation. They’re the trophy. Consequently, before they publish a word, journalists must seriously consider what role they’ll end up playing in the narrative, and whose work they’ll end up doing as a result.In the context of the QAnon story, participants’ efforts to pressure, even outright harass, reporters into engaging with the story has been widely interpreted as proof of how seriously participants take the story, and therefore as proof of how worried we all should be.We should all be worried. But what we should be most worried about is the fact that too many journalists have continued to respond “how high?” when media manipulators demand that they jump.Whitney Phillips is incoming assistant professor in the communication and rhetorical studies department at Syracuse University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d480d82b632b815f7d7f2d9eaaed95c540802e97/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61ebe386e3aa4cd98b698e6912d99550","title":"view from abroad britain no deal","story":"Britain is no readier for Brexit in August than it was in July. But because parliament is not sitting, the sun is out and everything slows down at this time of year, the atmosphere of crisis has dissipated. It is a curious phenomenon: EU membership expires next March, but relentless motion towards a deadline doesn’t bring any sense of advance towards a destination. Westminster cycles between chaos and calm, oddly detached from the reality of what must be achieved without time to spare. This is one thing that strikes me after a month away from the UK. I didn’t go far, only to France, but it was distance enough to notice how, from the outside, British politics manages to look frenetic and stuck at the same time.Theresa May was also in France at the end of last week. She held talks with Emmanuel Macron at the Fort de Brégançon, a Mediterranean retreat for French presidents since Charles de Gaulle. Or rather, she talked and he listened. The disparity in how much was at stake for the two leaders shone through every account. The British prime minister was depicted as desperate for help from European capitals to rehabilitate a Brexit plan that is only a few weeks old but already ailing. There was no sense of Macron needing anything in return no discussion of how he should play it.Many French media reports digressed on to the symbolic question of Brégançon, how it was back in play as a diplomatic stage after a period of neglect. The semiotics of presidential power were more of a talking point than anything the president himself might actually do about Brexit.Macron hasn’t had an easy summer. French politics has been consumed by l’affaire Benalla – the scandal of a presidential bodyguard caught on film, wearing police insignia to which he was not entitled, beating demonstrators. It has raised questions about\u0026nbspunaccountable power and the culture of arrogance\u0026nbsparound a notoriously self-regarding president. France went into political meltdown and yet, as I watched it happen, I couldn’t help marvelling at how tame, how monochrome it all felt, relative to the\u0026nbsppsychedelic unravelling of Westminster around the\u0026nbspsame time.This is not to belittle Alexandre Benalla’s offences. As scandals go, it’s a big ’un. But immersion in British politics had distorted my sense of scale. Next to Brexit, the story of the preening president’s rogue bodyguard looked almost old-fashioned – a crisis of manageable proportions. You could imagine it one day being discussed in the past tense. And if crisis is the mot juste for what has been happening in France, what the hell should you call the thing that Britain is going through?There is a common Eurosceptic proposition that the rest of Europe is complacent about Brexit. It is argued that a collapse of the negotiations, leading to disorderly rupture, damages the EU just as surely as it damages the UK – so continental politicians must be forced to confront the risks. Then they will be more flexible, if not from generosity then from awakened self-interest.No one in Paris, Berlin or Brussels doubts that Brexit is\u0026nbspdangerous for the EU and that the failure of talks would\u0026nbspbe disastrous. But what those who seek to mobilise that prospect for leverage in the negotiations fail to appreciate is how the whole threatening idiom – defiant swigging from the bottle marked “no deal” – completes the picture of a nation losing its balance, sliding out of control. British politics has turned crazy and the craziest politicians wave their craziness around as proof that they should be taken more seriously. The red-eyed, slurring drunk offers to demonstrate his sobriety by pouring out another drink without shpilling a\u0026nbspshingle drop.A booze-fuelled odyssey might contain many volatile scenes, experienced by the drinker as significant episodes: the stranger who becomes the new best friend the sudden explosive row expulsion from the pub. But from the outside, these are minor details when the salient story is the drinking itself.Over the course of one single week in July, the Brexit secretary and the foreign secretary both resigned, there were backbench rebellions and serial government humiliations, there was talk of no-confidence motions, leadership challenges, the prime minister falling, early elections … each day’s events might have qualified as crises in their own right.Combined, they might have been more than a crisis, yet somehow the sheer volume of mess actually diminished the impact. At least that’s what it looked like from France. It was a violent attack of gut spasms in a body politic tormented by a problem that it refuses to admit. It was Westminster vomiting a load of news on to the kerb before staggering towards the next bar.The government is so stupefied by Brexit it can hardly walk. Labour says the problem is not the drinking but the choice of drink. As if a slightly softer red from Jeremy Corbyn’s radical left cellar would succeed where the Tory right’s hard stuff has failed. An abstinence movement is growing but it lacks leadership.Or maybe we just haven’t hit the bottom yet. Maybe British politics just has to ride out a few more cycles of mania and denial. It resembles an addict’s compulsion to keep going, to repeat the degrading pattern again and again, because carrying on feels easier than stopping because to stop would mean a brutal audit of harm already done, relationships ruined, money squandered, poison already ingested. It is a painful reckoning, but not one that can be postponed for ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08f0335f47228d00829dec16956704b363be1d94/0_173_5048_3030/master/5048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13d62be0509386d39fc553e77b695665","title":"children summer holidays school boredom entertain","story":"Left to their own devices, children grow in resilience and gain skills – including learning how to entertain themselvesRemember the summer holidays when you were at school? How you and your friends had the opportunity to learn a new sport, brush up on your maths for September or take advantage of a plethora of educational and recreational opportunities? How your parents would spend hours planning your break in order for you to get the most out of your teacher-free time?No? Me neither. In fact, like many of my generation, I spent most of the long break wondering what on earth to do with myself. Other than 10 days in misty Cornwall, much of my summer was spent with my mum and siblings at home in Bedfordshire, complaining of boredom, getting into petty squabbles and feeling that I must be missing out on something more exciting.But I also remember building a disastrously rickety slide for my younger brother out of my dad’s wooden step-ladder (sorry dad), a plank of wood, some nails and a little blind faith. Or picking blackberries from the local fields and setting up a little stall outside my house with an honesty box (I still remember the thrill of hearing a car pull up and the chink of coins rattling in the tin). Of creating a time-capsule of memories with a best friend and digging it up two weeks later, marvelling at how we’d changed.Once we got into the swing of things, my siblings and I would phone radio shows to win prizes, camp in the garden in our tent, create “come and buy” sales at the weekend and encourage my long-suffering parents to come along and spend 20p on something they already owned. We had moments of listless boredom, but also created some of my fondest memories.Now a mother of five children under nine, and someone who – alongside my husband – has to juggle work and infants during this hot and sticky time of year, I am inundated with articles and blog posts full of clever ideas about how to keep my children entertained over the summer. If I am not constantly building sandcastles, baking cupcakes or running them to various sporting activities it seems I am failing. Initially, I fell for the hype. It’s two weeks in and we’ve already been swimming several times, had friends round, visited the local lake. I’ve tried my best to keep the diary full and smiles on faces. Because, if I don’t, that makes me a bad parent, right?However, I’ve come to realise that overfilling the children’s time makes them tired and stroppy and that some of the best days we’ve had so far have been ones on which I’ve dropped the parental ball. Sure, finding out that nothing’s planned for the day ahead will initially draw the odd cry of “it’s not fair” or “what shall I do?” but after a little time, my children have begun to find ways to make their own fun – I’ve stopped planning and the universe hasn’t imploded. In fact, I don’t think anyone has actually noticed. Yes, they do watch a bit of TV. And they do have access to tablet computers. But these are strictly limited to first thing in the morning (to give us a chance to wake up) and just after lunch (to give us a chance to clear up). The rest of the hours now yawn before them, gloriously unstructured. And you know what, we’re all having more fun as a result.Dr Sharie Coombes, a child and family psychotherapist, agrees that experiencing boredom can be crucial for developing minds: “Boredom can be a really important experience for children and young people to have in terms of their own social, intellectual, emotional and psychological development. Children need space to find out who they are (not who we see them as), how they can apply their own skills to new situations, how to overcome obstacles and improvise, and how to feel a sense of pride in what they are capable of doing. “If children don’t have a chance to think for themselves or resolve their own minor problems, they may be far less likely to go on to be resilient, self-soothing or creative.”From playing “mummies and daddies” (a grittily realistic game involving babies and cats that, for me, lacks any sort of appeal) to painting their feet and running over a piece of wallpaper from building opposing camps in the garden out of blankets and pillows, clothes-horses and pegs to inventing a new game called “bubble trampoline” my children have begun to tap into their more creative side.And while their newfound self-reliance can sometimes have its drawbacks (I now have red handprints on the newly painted cream of my outside wall and the paddling pool has been popped), I think my kids have found an inner resourcefulness that none of us previously believed possible. Reader, my eldest daughter has even voluntarily tidied her room.Of course, my kids’ holiday isn’t going to be completely without structure. We’re still going to visit the pool and improve their swimming, we’ll have the odd trip out and ride our bikes together in the park. But taking a step back has taught me to relax and realise that by being more hands-off, I’m helping my little ones grow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82592fe9a6f09bb07c6b37f01d0e83677de12998/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=465b372698893343097ba222137aed78","title":"can cricket become the game of choice for young bme women","story":"Cricket has a huge following among the BME community – particularly south Asians – yet few women try their hand at the sport. Two Leicestershire women have set out to change thatGrowing up in Pakistan, Nafeesa Katib remembers watching cricket with her siblings on a TV hired at the weekend as a treat. It wasn’t a viewing choice at the time – it was the only thing being broadcast – but she remembers it fondly. “Even if we didn’t like cricket we had to watch it, and in the end all of us fell in love with the game,” she says. She remembers thinking: “Where are all the women on the cricket field?” That thought stuck with her after she moved to the UK as a teenager. Now 41, and living in Leicestershire with her husband and two children of her own, she is helping to redress that imbalance, in her role as a cricket coach for girls aged eight to 14. Her hope is to be a role model to all the girls who attend her sessions – but also to show, as a visibly Muslim woman playing and teaching cricket, that a headscarf need not stop anyone playing sport. “If you’ve got somebody who inspires you, who shows you, yes, I can do it, it’s a great feeling. And that’s what I try do,” says Katib.Women’s cricket has never been more popular in the UK – 2017 was a landmark year, as millions watched the England team triumph in the Women’s Cricket World Cup in front of a sold-out crowd at Lord’s. In the wake of that result, the cricket governing board said it was committed to getting more south Asian women involved in the game.One reason is the lack of appropriate coaching and facilities. In Oadby, where Katib lives, there were no organised sporting activities for her nine-year-old daughter on a Saturday morning – until cricket came along. “Most of the things are aimed at boys, like the football clubs for example,” says Katib. “There were some crafty things for girls, but not all girls are into arts and crafts.”Her friend and fellow coach Mai Kazi emphasises that the scheduling of sports sessions can be an issue, particularly for kids who come from a Muslim background. “Most of the Muslim kids in the area go to Islamic school between 4pm and 6pm, and that’s when most of the clubs are held,” says Kazi. But a Saturday morning works perfectly for her and her 13-year-old daughter, and the sessions are something they now do together. The coaches have worked hard to create a safe environment for girls from all backgrounds, who might be feeling apprehensive about throwing themselves into the game.“There are a few girls who wear headscarves,” says Katib. “The first time they came they were very nervous and really worried about them, with one hand touching their head at all times. But over time I’ve been able to give them a bit of confidence. At the end of the day, it’s all girls there.”Although having women run the sessions has boosted participation from the local Muslim and south Asian community, it’s the sight of two familiar faces that encourages parents to keep bringing their kids back. “A lot of the mums that drop their girls off know us from school,” says Kazi. “We live in a very small borough, so it’s the kind of place where everyone knows each other. There is obviously the sense of: ‘Oh, this is run by someone we know.’”She believes that community feeling is essential to the project’s success: “The fact it’s very local has really appealed to people – otherwise, they’d have to travel to Leicester, which isn’t always possible.”Katib has just completed her level two coaching certificate and hopes, one day, to run her own club. But the key thing for her is to keep showing her daughter there’s no such thing as a sport girls can’t do.“I’ve never wanted my daughter to think that certain things are only for girls, and that certain things are only for boys,” she says. “There shouldn’t be any limitations for anything.” In 2017 one of the key elements of Natwest’s partnership with the ECB was to help raise funding to open up even more opportunities for young people, both male and female, to enjoy cricket. This will continue in 2018.As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981.

During his workshop, at St Edmund Campion Catholic School near Birmingham, he tells a group of children how he was expelled from school for stabbing a schoolmate with a screwdriver – and how, as a teenager, he spent years running with gangs, carrying guns and knives, and dealing drugs.The urban youth specialist stares into the eyes of each member of his audience in turn as he explains what it was like to serve time in 11 different prisons. He tells the children, some as young as 12, about a friend who was stabbed to death 16 years ago: “I buried him.” He talks about a different friend who is in prison for life. “He asked me to tell you not to repeat his mistakes,” he says.His 12-week Crime Awareness Programme aims to take young people who have been identified as being at risk of exclusion from school, or falling foul of the law, and engage them in a positive activity to help them understand the risks and consequences of criminal behaviour.Provided in four West Midlands schools, the programme is backed by Chance to Shine, a charity that brings cricket to thousands of young people in inner-city areas. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine uses the sport to encourage social cohesion and steer youngsters away from antisocial behaviour and crime.His programme pulls no punches. With the help of some hard-hitting videos, he explains how some teenagers have even been sent to prison for life because they were part of a gang from which a different member murdered someone – known as “joint enterprise” prosecutions.Having delivered his wake-up call, he leads the children out into the sunshine to play cricket. With the composed, avuncular authority of a natural, he gathers them into a pre-game huddle and then encourages from the sidelines as they play in the sun. From the darkness and danger of gang life to the lightness and laughter of team spirit, it’s a powerful package.The youngsters play tape-ball cricket – a simple, inclusive and fun version of the game that uses plastic bats and a tennis ball wrapped in electrical tape. The six-a-side sessions last about 20 minutes.Sam says the contrast between the workshops and the cricket games is crucial. “The information in the workshops can be really hard-hitting, and in some cases the kids will have had similar things happen to friends or family members, so it might be a bit heavy for some iniduals,” he explains.“The cricket really lightens it up. It’s a great way to engage with them, to get them into teamwork and for them to come out of their comfort zone.”Sam says cricket is a “perfect game” for his mission, because it discourages star treatment. “In life, there is always going to be one boy or girl who is more charismatic, or more popular, and others who are more shy.“I want to give the shy iniduals a chance to shine, and encourage the more popular ones to tone it down a little bit. When we play cricket, we’re all on the same footing. It encourages teamwork and communication skills.”He has thought carefully about every aspect of his programme, right down to what he wears. “I need them to listen to me so I immerse myself in their culture,” he says. “The way I dress for these days, even my choice of trainers, is geared to show them that I understand what’s going on their lives.”His classroom vocabulary mirrors this. When he challenges one pupil for not paying attention, he tells them: “You’re not listening – you’re on some switch-off ting.”His energy is high throughout. “Kids who are in trouble are usually perpetually in fight-or-flight mode – their energy is different to other kids’, so I need to meet them where they are,” he says, bouncing from one foot to the other.One of the pupils, a 13-year-old boy, says he always thought cricket was “boring” but that he’s come to love it. “Before I started these workshops I was always in trouble and getting detentions, but now I’m not getting in any trouble. Cricket has really helped me.”A 16-year-old girl agrees, saying her friends have told her that they’ve seen a “really positive change” in her since she started the programme.She says Sam’s frankness about his own past makes it easier for her to trust him. “He’s taught me that life can be really dangerous, or really straightforward. It depends on which path you take.”One 12-year-old boy adds that the cricket sessions with Sam are his favourite part of school, and that he looks forward to them all week. “Tanayah’s my hero,” he smiles.Sam is proud of the effect his work is having. “To take kids who were on the road to being excluded from school and see them staying on to complete their GCSEs is amazing,” he says. “Statistics show that once a child is excluded, the chances of them going to prison are increased.”Surveys conducted at the beginning and end of a previous 12-week programme found the vast majority of those taking part experienced a change of heart towards knife and gang crime. At the start of the programme, about a fifth of the youngsters agreed with the statement that being in a gang made them safer by the end, only one person felt that way. Of those who started with no strong feelings either way, most disagreed strongly by the end.As for Sam, he says he turned his own life around when he discovered the teachings of Islam. “They showed me to value life, to value the law of the land,” he says. “I feel like this is what I’m here to do. Once upon a time, I called people to evil. Now I call people to good.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

You might even think of boxing: the city is home to some of the sport’s greatest exponents, including recent former world champion Tony Bellew and former British and Commonwealth champion David Price.But few people would associate Liverpool with cricket.Chance to Shine, the sports charity whose mission is to “spread the power of cricket throughout schools and communities” is hoping to change that. With the help of NatWest – with which it has formed a formidable, multi-year partnership – it aims to reintroduce cricket to inner-city state schools, and provide resources and facilities for underprivileged children to learn how to play the game. Since its inception, more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – have been given a chance to enjoy the sport. Some of those who were introduced to cricket through the charity have gone on to play on the national stage and even faced international Test teams.Chance to Shine currently runs three projects in Liverpool – the largest in the Anfield area, with smaller cricket training clubs in Toxteth and Dingle.“Liverpool isn’t known as a cricket city,” says Sam Goodall-Walker, a league coach on the Lancashire Cricket Board and a lead coach on the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool. “One of the challenges we face is to change the attitudes toward cricket in the city to show that anyone can come down, learn to play and be good at it.”Goodall-Walker has been a coach on the Chance to Shine project since 2013, during which time there have been a number of successes. “We ran a project in Anfield, in schools that didn’t have resources to play cricket, where nearly all the students hadn’t played before,” he says. “In the five years it’s been running, five students have started playing regular club cricket, and two students play cricket for the Lancashire district.”Of course, the successes aren’t just in getting young people to play competitively.“We work with young people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds,” says Goodall-Walker. “For example, we worked with one young man called Michael, who has dyspraxia, and there were times in his life when he felt really isolated and lacked confidence.”He goes on to say that it was the extra, specially tailored coaching that helps young men like Michael thrive at cricket. “Disability cricket training was the thing that really boosted his confidence and gave him the extra support and guidance he needed, and he is now playing senior-level cricket.”Goodall-Walker also says that the Chance to Shine cricket programme has the power to help young people arriving from other countries feel at home, and give them the opportunities to succeed.It’s not just boys benefitting from the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool either. “There’s around 30 girls who play cricket every week at our club,” says 15-year-old Charlotte Dunn, who plays at Wavetry cricket club. Dunn has been playing cricket for the past six years, and says that the enthusiasm of coaches, and the supportive environment means that “everyone, regardless of your background, where you’re from, whether you’re a boy or a girl, can learn and enjoy playing cricket”.Part of that supportive environment includes pairing younger players with older ones, who can act as role models and mentors. “I’ve been paired with people who are still in primary school, and showing them how to play can really boost their confidence,” she says. It’s that, combined with how “approachable the club and all its staff are,” which she says has made so many young women stick with the club. “The coaches will make sure everyone’s involved and that they’re having fun. The most important thing to them is that we’re having a good time.”Goodall-Walker says that while the project has achieved a great deal of success, there’s still “plenty more work to do”.“We have to be realistic if we want to survive in the long term,” he says. “We still want to work with schools to give them a chance to try out cricket, and we still want to work with youth clubs and community centres who want to try out new things ... but there has to be a bigger cultural change for cricket to get the same amount of support as football and other sports.”Part of that reluctance, he says, is because of how cricket – particularly in its longer formats – is perceived in working-class, urbanised areas of the city, where it is seen as “very traditional, and associated with middle-class white people”.“Attitudes toward cricket need to change,” he continues. “But that can only happen if the game adapts too. It needs to adapt to a society that moves faster, and can’t afford to spend a whole day playing and watching cricket. We need more variation in the kind of games offered to attract more people to the sport. There’s no reason why cricket needs to be so traditional or old-school. That’s what’s stopping it progressing and flourishing in places where there’s so much potential talent.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

In part, this arises because there are fewer school leavers. People turning 18 this year were born around the millennium, when there were 100,000 fewer babies in England and Wales than in 1990. At the same time, universities in England are free to recruit as many students as they like. In the old days, when universities A and B filled up their places, people enrolled at C or D instead. Now, the most popular universities can expand, leaving others more vulnerable. One result of this frothy market has been an explosion in unconditional offers, where a university wants a student so much it doesn’t mind what A-level results they achieve.Some say this is a terrible thing that lowers standards in A-levels, and call for unconditional offers to be banned. But that’s unlikely to happen. Just last year, the government reinforced in law the right of universities in England “to determine the criteria for the admission of students”.Sam Gyimah, the universities minister, has alighted upon a different solution to the rash of unconditional offers. He has called for a different system of university entrance, in which people apply after receiving their results.Other countries do things differently. A new comparison of university application systems around the world for the University and College Union concludes that “England, Wales \u0026amp Northern Ireland are real outliers in terms of their reliance on predicted grades”.The minister’s suggestion is nothing new. Indeed, as a special adviser to one of his predecessors, I helped get an official commitment to consider PQA into the ill-fated 2011 higher education white paper. Yet, around the same time, a formal review by Ucas found considerable opposition to the idea from schools, colleges and universities.To understand why PQA has not become the norm, you must recognise the uniqueness of our system. Here, students typically move to another part of the country to study. I call it the ‘boarding school model’. It necessitates a complex sifting arrangement for matching applicants to places.This arose in part due to the centuries-long dominance of Oxford and Cambridge, to which students generally had to travel. Studying away from home is not standard practice for students in other countries, where you typically live at home and pop down to your local university to study.Shifting to PQA would come with some clear downsides. It would pile yet more pressure on already highly stressed young people to do even better in their exams – now said to be harder anyway, thanks to recent reforms – as everything would hinge on the result. The drawn-out system of UCAS forms, predicted grades and school references may be imperfect, but it encourages universities to take into account a wide range of factors when deciding whom to admit, not just A-level grades. In systems where students are offered places after they have their results, there can be an excessive focus on exams.In Australia, university offers have been based on the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR), which plots school leavers against their peers on a score from 0 to 99.95. So a student with an ATAR of 99 has the pick of courses, while one with an ATAR below 50 can struggle to find a place. The excessive focus on a single score has led to calls for change.To ease the pressure on young people, we would need a completely different sort of university system alongside PQA. A few radical thinkers, such as Tim Blackman, vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, have proposed a system of “comprehensive universities”, in which most students would attend their local institution. There would be few minimum entry standards.That seems a distant prospect, but it shows the scale of change needed for post-qualification applications to work well. And if we’re not prepared to have those sorts of conversations then we should end the PQA debate PDQ.Nick Hillman is director of the Higher Education Policy Institute"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0e051c28cf658070c268a629620f6091da779c3/0_321_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bab61e95ac478e8361788e2123e388d6","title":"islamic school israeli palestine conflict","story":"More than 550,000 students took GCSE history this summer, says Michael Davies, a history teacher at Lancaster Royal Grammar, a selective state boys’ school in Lancashire. “Of those, only 2,200 had studied Israel and Palestine. In comparison, 70,000 had studied the history of the American West.”At Abrar Academy, a private Muslim boys’ school based in a former Methodist church in Preston, this year’s GCSE cohort did not take the IsraelPalestine option. Like so many schools of all dominations, they studied the first world war instead.It’s not that the boys aren’t interested, says Suhayl Hafiz, curriculum manager, during the eerily quiet lunch break: “Palestine is the third holiest site in Islam, and the conflict is something all the boys have heard about, whether at the mosque or at home or in school.”It was their history teacher’s decision, he says, as a group of boys in long white tunics play barefoot football downstairs where the pews used to be. “They weren’t really confident at that time.” It’s something Davies has often heard: “Teachers are scared of it. It’s a hot potato. They are worried about upsetting parents or the kids saying something which will be reported to the authorities, and so they teach the Tudors instead.”Yet towards the end of Abrar’s summer term, Hafiz accepted an offer from Davies to teach a class on one of the most isive conflicts in the modern world. It was a big moment for Davies, who has set up a project called Parallel Histories, which teaches IsraelPalestine from both sides rather than “twisting competing perspectives into a single, compromised narrative”.In June he organised an event at the House of Lords to discuss why so few schools dare to teach this difficult and often very emotional topic. None of the 20 or so Muslim schools he invited came. A few Jewish institutions did, encouraged by Samantha Benson, director of education at the Partnership for Jewish Schools.It was disappointing but not a surprise. “Muslim schools are acutely aware of the potential for bad publicity after the Trojan Horse affair,” says Davies, referring to a scandal in some Birmingham schools in 2013 and 2014 when hardline Muslims were accused of conspiring to take over local schools and running them according to strict Islamic principles.“The downside of tackling Israel and Palestine in front of outsiders is obvious – Muslim students care passionately about it and the story of Palestinian oppression feeds into a broader narrative of Muslims as victims of western aggression, and that’s not an area where most teachers want to go with observers in the classroom,” says Davies.At the Abrar academy, a warning bell sounds out across the school. It is still the middle of a lesson but the bell tells the boys that they have 15 minutes before their afternoon prayer. At the anointed time, they will kneel down in neat rows and press their skullcap-clad heads to the ground in worship before it is time for the last secular class of the day. Afternoons are devoted to secular studies the morning is set aside for Islamic study: Qur’anic recitation and translation, Arabic lessons and Islamic theology. In 2016, Ofsted found the school “requires improvement”, saying teaching in secular subjects did not help pupils to learn as well as in Islamic lessons.Around 120 boys aged 11 to 21 study at Abrar, which was set up in 2009 by Hadhrat Shaikh Maulana Fazlehaq Wadee, a scholar of the Deobandi strand of Sunni Islam. Day pupils pay £1,300 a year – boarders £2,500 (Lancaster Royal Grammar charges £11,181 per year for boarders, considered to be at the bargain basement end of the market).Although the Deobandis have a reputation for hardline puritanism (the Taliban are its most notorious proponents), the teaching at Abrar is quite liberal, insists Hafiz, an alumnus of a Preston state school. “We think of ourselves as British so we are quite liberal in that sense.” He points to link projects with nearby Lowton high school, including a visit by their pupils who tried on Islamic dress and experienced Muslim education for a day.People make the wrong assumptions about us, says a 15-year-old boarder from Newcastle. “My parents wanted me to go to a secular school but it was me that pushed to come here.” Some of the boys change into jeans and T-shirts as soon as school is out: others prefer Islamic dress seven days a week. A good proportion of the boys aspire to be an imam or a Muslim scholar, perhaps after pursing a secular degree.All of Abrar’s teachers are male and when female students visit the school and take extracurricular lessons on the balcony, they are shielded by fabric and room iders. Nonetheless the boys do not seem fazed by the arrival of a blond female reporter with bare arms and uncovered hair, and are curious about the ’s interest in their school.Davies is excited about the lesson he has planned on the Balfour declaration, a hotly contested document signed by the British in 1917 which promised the land of Palestine to the Zionist Federation, a recently established political movement whose goal was the creation of a Jewish state.The boys, aged 14 to 19, have already been split into two groups to prepare for a debate. Half were disappointed to be told they must argue that the British should be praised for the declaration – an opinion held by very few Muslims.Two boys are appointed judges and mark their classmates on content and presentation, totting up the scores to declare the Palestinian side winners, though only by a whisker.Abdul, 15, on the Israel team, says his side had to work harder: “I told the team, swallow your pride, just do it. Even after hours and hours of research we thought Palestine had a stronger argument, so to find an argument for Israel and the Jews to have this thing was really difficult.“But we did find it, we found small things to pick out and expand on, and we were very close to actually winning. I was more on the other side but now I’ve got a bit more understanding and think Israel does have a point. In this school especially we are trying to become Muslim scholars but we have to go out there and we need to be aware of what’s going on – this is Britain, we need to understand British values. All of this will help us understand tolerance, etc. If we are biased to one opinion by ignorance then it’s not fair. No matter if they are Jews or whatever, they are still human. We have to respect them.”After the Abrar lesson, just two boys say that they still believe Israel does not have a right to exist.“Obviously you have to look at it with a sympathetic view when you are dealing with the Jewish part of things because they came out of the holocaust and needed a land of their own and Palestine did have a bit of space,” says Mohammed, 19.“But what makes me say that Israel doesn’t have the right to exist is the fundamentals of what it was built on and how they deal with Palestine right now.”Davies asks if he would distinguish between “right to exist” and “be heavily criticised”. “I wouldn’t say it should be eliminated right now but the basis on which Israel was built was wrong,” says the boy. “I don’t think it should be removed now that it exists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0694f19270efc27e3edfcff02728525b768a6b96/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=000004baa48049b11dc934dd1d879268","title":"domino effect of climate events could push earth into a hothouse state","story":"Leading scientists warn that passing such a point would make efforts to reduce emissions increasingly futile A domino-like cascade of melting ice, warming seas, shifting currents and dying forests could tilt the Earth into a “hothouse” state beyond which human efforts to reduce emissions will be increasingly futile, a group of leading climate scientists has warned.This grim prospect is sketched out in a journal paper that considers the combined consequences of 10 climate change processes, including the release of methane trapped in Siberian permafrost and the impact of melting ice in Greenland on the Antarctic.The authors of the essay, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, stress their analysis is not conclusive, but warn the Paris commitment to keep warming at 2C above pre-industrial levels may not be enough to “park” the planet’s climate at a stable temperature.They warn that the hothouse trajectory “would almost certainly flood deltaic environments, increase the risk of damage from coastal storms, and eliminate coral reefs (and all of the benefits that they provide for societies) by the end of this century or earlier.”“I do hope we are wrong, but as scientists we have a responsibility to explore whether this is real,” said Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. “We need to know now. It’s so urgent. This is one of the most existential questions in science.”Rockström and his co-authors are among the world’s leading authorities on positive feedback loops, by which warming temperatures release new sources of greenhouse gases or destroy the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon or reflect heat.Their new paper asks whether the planet’s temperature can stabilise at 2C or whether it will gravitate towards a more extreme state. The authors attempt to assess whether warming can be halted or whether it will tip towards a “hothouse” world that is 4C warmer than pre-industrial times and far less supportive of human life.Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen, one of the authors, said the paper showed that climate action was not just a case of turning the knob on emissions, but of understanding how various factors interact at a global level.“We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions,” she said. “This implies not only reducing emissions but much more.”New feedback loops are still being discovered. A separate paper published in PNAS reveals that increased rainfall – a symptom of climate change in some regions - is making it harder for forest soils to trap greenhouse gases such as methane.Previous studies have shown that weakening carbon sinks will add 0.25C, forest dieback will add 0.11C, permafrost thaw will add 0.9C and increased bacterial respiration will add 0.02C. The authors of the new paper also look at the loss of methane hydrates from the ocean floor and the reduction of snow and ice cover at the poles.Rockström says there are huge gaps in data and knowledge about how one process might amplify another. Contrary to the Gaia theory, which suggests the Earth has a self-righting tendency, he says the feedbacks could push the planet to a more extreme state. As an example, the authors say the loss of Greenland ice could disrupt the Gulf Stream ocean current, which would raise sea levels and accumulate heat in the Southern Ocean, which would in turn accelerate ice loss from the east Antarctic. Concerns about this possibility were heightened earlier this year by reports that the Gulf Stream was at its weakest level in 1,600 years. Currently, global average temperatures are just over 1C above pre-industrial levels and rising at 0.17C per decade. The Paris climate agreement set actions to keep warming limited to 1.5C-2C by the end of the century, but the authors warn more drastic action may be necessary.“The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming,” Rockström said. “Several positive feedback loops are already in operation, but they are still weak. We need studies to show when they might cause a runaway effect.Another climate scientist – who was not involved in the paper – emphasised the document aimed to raise questions rather than prove a theory. “It’s rather selective, but not outlandish,” said Prof Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute. “Threshold and tipping points have been discussed previously, but to state that 2C is a threshold we can’t pull back from is new, I think. I’m not sure what ‘evidence’ there is for this – or indeed whether there can be until we experience it.”Rockström said the question needed asking. “We could end up delivering the Paris agreement and keep to 2C of warming, but then face an ugly surprise if the system starts to slip away,” he said. “We don’t say this will definitely happen. We just list all the disruptive events and come up with plausible occurrences … 50 years ago, this would be dismissed as alarmist, but now scientists have become really worried.”“In the context of the summer of 2018, this is definitely not a case of crying wolf, raising a false alarm: the wolves are now in sight,” said Dr Phil Williamson, a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia. “The authors argue that we need to be much more proactive in that regard, not just ending greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible, but also building resilience in the context of complex Earth system processes that we might not fully understand until it is too late.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eac1ed962b2cebcecfcb4e65d0f2a7b98b5cdee2/0_171_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=718e49ed7c4ca728cfb2900753885931","title":"natural hair nappily ever after","story":"Finally, a film taking black women’s hair stories to the big screen. Netflix film Nappily Ever After, based on the 2000 book by Trisha R Thomas, tells the story of Violet Jones (Sanaa Lathan) – a black woman who prides herself on her long, straightened hair and is desperate for her boyfriend to propose to her. Her life starts to fall apart after her boyfriend presents her with a dog rather than a ring, and so she cuts both him and her hair off. “My hair was like a second job,” she says. “Now I’m forced to focus on myself. I wonder who I’ll be?”It’s deep stuff – if you know where to look. The natural-hair movement has been in full swing since the mid-00s but there are plenty of black women, like me, who are still at the beginning of their journeys. I\u0026nbspcut my relaxed hair off three months ago. I don’t regret my decision, but I\u0026nbspcan’t deny that I often feel ugly and conflicted about my hair’s texture.The gravity of a black woman deciding to cut her hair off and go “natural” in a white supremacist society (yes, ours) should not be underestimated. Almost every black hairdresser I visited before finally plucking up the courage to cut my hair off told me I was making the wrong decision, but it was a reminder of how deeply entrenched these views are.This isn’t just about looks: our wider history is stained by instances such as the apartheid-era pencil test in South Africa – those who could hold a pencil in their hair without it falling out could not be classified as white. To this day, black women and girls lose job offers and are sent to detention or are suspended because our hairstyles don’t suit white sensibilities.The natural-hair movement itself has biases: its obsession with “laying your edges” (using gel products to flatten the edges of your hair), and the way glossy curls are championed over kinks. Even Lathan has a loose-textured curl that sits closer to acceptability than a texture like my own. I believe black women can wear a weave or relax their hair and still love themselves, but I wonder where the film will draw the line in terms of the reliance many of us have on chemical straighteners and weaves. We are not a monolith and rather than insecurity, many decisions stem from practicality or fun – who wouldn’t want rainbow braids for Black Pride? Beyond that, I don’t think you can blame us for falling into the grips of what society has always said is “good hair”.It is a shame that Nappily Ever After doesn’t feature a black woman whose hair is more tightly textured, but I’m hopeful that the cheesy rom-com will go some way in terms of normalising what is already normal: the hair that grows out of our heads and what we choose to do with it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b16c5b5770520d80f49e2f2b51d9adf13fa1fcb/32_704_1839_1104/master/1839.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dc4ba538da3dc5ec5b7023547573eb0","title":"what to wear in august in pictures","story":"What better time than a heatwave to pack a punch with prints, playful accessories and pops of fruity colour?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ba0c2a90dbb3604e1306b5fab4c523f26d5c690/0_164_4198_2519/master/4198.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b60c8b6f3e0c764466c9567d6abf26f","title":"city of lies johnny depps notorious big film shelved","story":"Movie about LAPD detective investigating murder of rapper had been slated for release on 7 SeptemberCity of Lies – a crime film starring Johnny Depp and Forrest Whittaker, about the investigation into the death of rapper Notorious BIG – has reportedly been pulled from theatrical release a month before it was due to come out.The film, directed by Brad Furman, follows LAPD detective Russell Poole (Depp) investigating the murder of Notorious BIG, also known as Biggie Smalls (real name Christopher Wallace), the year after the murder of fellow rapper Tupac Shakur. Whittaker plays journalist Jack Johnson, who joins forces with Poole to solve the murder.

Brooks filed a lawsuit in July for unspecified damages. The suit, which also names the film’s director and producers, alleges that Depp verbally abused Brooks before punching him twice. Brooks also alleges that he was fired when he wouldn’t agree not to sue, according to Associated Press reports. The incident came shortly after Depp settled a $25m fraud case against his one-time business managers. It follows a long string of bad press, including allegations of domestic violence from his former wife, the actor Amber Heard, in 2016.

In 2010 the Jessica Jones actor Rachael Taylor – then Newton’s fiance – alleged “two unprovoked assaults”, resulting in a two-year apprehended domestic violence order against him, which he was charged with breaching the following year. Chastain has been an advocate for gender equality in Hollywood since 2016, when she launched Freckle Films, the all-female production company which will co-produce Eve. In an interview with the  in May last year she called for more female film critics and later that year spoke out at the Cannes film festival about the “disturbing” representation of women in the program. After the revelations against Harvey Weinstein, Chastain became a spokeswoman for the Time’s Up campaign and, in an interview with Australia’s The Feed, she said she always considered allegations of abuse when deciding who to work with. “I’ve always made choices, in all the work that I’ve done, to make sure that on any film set that I’m working with people that there isn’t a question about whether or not abuse has taken place,” she said. “It’s very important to me that I practise what I preach, and that my actions follow my words.” Chastain is yet to respond to criticism on Twitter.In 2007 Newton – the son of the Australian TV personality Bert Newton – was charged with violently assaulting, stalking and intimidating Satchwell, but pleaded guilty to one count of common assault. His conviction was eventually overturned, with his defence citing mental illness and the appeal judge describing him as a “kind and giving” man with “extraordinary” references.Three years later Taylor took out an AVO against him, alleging “violence, threats, abuse and intimidation”. Court documents say his physical, verbal and mental abuse of her culminated in an alleged incident in a hotel in Rome, in which she suffered “concussion, bruising and a sprained jaw” and injuries consistent with having her head “bashed against the floor and walls”. Newton was subsequently admitted to a hospital for mental health treatment.That same year Newton was arrested for allegedly assaulting a 66-year-old taxi driver, in charges that were eventually dismissed in 2011 the Daily  reported that he had been readmitted to rehab after breaching the court order stipulating that he not contact Taylor and in 2012 he was arrested for hitting a hotel clerk, which resulted in a fine and community service. He has avoided convictions for all the alleged assaults, and now lives in New York.In February this year Indiewire questioned South by Southwest’s inclusion of Newtown’s latest film, Who We Are Now, in light of the #MeToo campaign. In response, Newton said: “It is absolutely intolerable to harm women, it is intolerable to harm men, it is intolerable to harm anyone. I had done these things, and I utterly regret it, and I have to live with this responsibility every day. I had a severe problem with substance and alcohol abuse then and for almost six years now I have actively worked every single day, one day at a time, to remain sober and live a clean, upstanding life.”In a joint statement announcing Eve, an action film being co-produced by Voltage Pictures, Chastain and Freckle Films’ Kelly Carmichael said: “Matthew is wonderfully adept at crafting complex and relatable characters. We’ve been fans of his work and are so thrilled to be partnering with him and Voltage on Eve.”Newton said: “I have always admired Jessica Chastain’s work. So when I wrote Eve, an intelligent, strong and incredibly capable character, she was my immediate first choice to bring her to life.”Chastain and Freckle Films have been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62b2425727adfc76b76cbcd19bd6e45260c9adaf/0_147_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f647c563fd4bb43183c35e466953d3f3","title":"arsenal stan kroenke offer buy club outright","story":"Arsenal’s majority shareholder Stan Kroenke has made a £600m offer to buy the whole of the Premier League club, which would take its value to £1.8bn, and insists his ambition for the club is “to see it competing consistently to win the Premier League and the Champions League.”Kroenke is acting through his own company, Kroenke Sports \u0026amp Entertainment, which also owns NFL’s LA Rams, NBA side Denver Nuggets, NHL team Colorado Avalanche and MLS’ Colorado Rapids.“KSE’s ambitions for the club are to see it competing consistently to win the Premier League and the Champions League, as well as the major trophies in the women’s senior game and at youth level.KSE says it has received an “irrevocable undertaking” from Red and White Securities to accept the offer as soon as possible, and in any event by 3pm on Tuesday.In October last year KSE offered £525m to buy the 18,695 shares held by Usmanov.

In the first instance things were wearily familiar, the explosion of optimism when their £32.5m signing cracked in a free-kick on his debut quickly being tempered by three goals from a Chelsea team who, in that first season, would finish 33 points clear of Mark Hughes’s side.“We are not going to do crazy stuff but it makes sense for us to build a dynasty,” Khaldoon al-Mubarak, installed as club chairman, said after the takeover had been formalised. The process has been iterative but last season the blocks fell into place and, after such a jaw-dropping procession to their third title in seven years, it seems the first stage of City’s project is complete. Under Pep Guardiola they have played football of a standard unparalleled in the Premier League era, give or take Arsenal’s sides from the early 2000s, and sent records tumbling in the process. The bar has been set dauntingly high and the measure of the project’s next phase will be City’s ability to meet it, then outjump it.It is a problem they have had before and that is why this season holds particular importance. No team have retained the Premier League title since Manchester United, in 2009, won their third in a row. City have tried and failed twice so it was worth listening to Vincent Kompany when, early in March and with first place essentially in the bag, the club captain sounded a warning.“We have won two titles at this club and both times when we came back there was an edge missing,” he said. “That is why it is so difficult to retain titles. Only special teams can do it and we have to become that special team this time.”The biggest factor City have in their favour for the nine months ahead is Guardiola, whose intense and sometimes prickly persona is the by-product of a ferocious desire for perfection. It seemed like a coup when, in May, he extended his contract for two years until 2021 he has never been committed to a football club for this long in his managerial career and appears besotted with an environment that has been purpose-built for him. A lack of internal politics helps: Guardiola has been allowed to work with scant distraction and the benefits have been astronomical.So how does one improve the side that has everything? This has been a summer of relatively minor tweaks, and City will essentially go with the squad that was expensively assembled to Guardiola’s satisfaction last season. The exception is Riyad Mahrez, who had been sought in January but arrived from Leicester for £60m in July. Mahrez, the best creative player outside last season’s top six, does not obviously replace anyone in the starting XI but his versatility will prove as useful as his flair.If he plays on the right then perhaps Raheem Sterling can be deployed through the middle, or maybe Bernardo Silva – whose exceptional Community Shield showing suggests much more should be expected this time around after a patchy first year – can be used regularly in the No 10 role that might suit him best. It is an addition that makes City more flexible, even trickier to second-guess, even harder to keep up with when Guardiola makes one of those quickfire, mid-game changes of shape that leave opponents flailing.Guardiola may still bring in a central midfielder before the transfer deadline, having been foiled in his pursuit of Jorginho. That deal broke down suddenly after the player opted to join Maurizio Sarri at Chelsea there is no major reason to fret but City do look curiously light in his position, particularly now Yaya Touré is no longer around. The excellent Fernandinho, now 33, may need nursing back after playing an unfortunate part in Brazil’s World Cup elimination İlkay Gündogan will play a major role while Kevin De Bruyne’s merits hardly need elucidating. Some dynamic back-up could be useful, unless one of City’s innumerable academy products can step up.The latter point will be worth marking, too. In contrast to his opposite number at Old Trafford, Guardiola took evident pleasure in leading a flock of youngsters through pre-season and particularly enjoyed a 3-2 comeback win over Bayern Munich in Miami.Phil Foden, the gifted 18-year-old playmaker, was involved throughout and the noise around him reached a crescendo when he performed so marvellously in the De Bruyne role against Chelsea at Wembley. The local boy has a real chance to make his mark, perhaps in some of the softer top-flight games to begin with. Guardiola has been criticised in some quarters for erging from the youth development principles he honed at Barcelona, and a prominent role for Foden would speak more positively for the pathway at a club that have, so far this summer, sold or moved on 24 youngsters.In the short term, though, that would merely be the garnish for the owners’ burning ambition: to conquer Europe. A first Champions League win would crown everything City have achieved so far and an improvement on last season’s quarter-final finish, as a minimum, appears obligatory if Guardiola is to avoid a renewal of the scrutiny that dogged parts of his first season. The manager himself could do with scratching the itch: seven years have passed since the second, and most recent, of his successes in the competition.City were arguably unlucky to face Liverpool last time around in the Champions League: it is certainly reasonable to think they would have outplayed any of their overseas rivals among an underwhelming field. Real Madrid’s adaptation to a post-Ronaldo era lends an obvious opportunity now and it is not a huge stretch to see Jürgen Klopp’s side posing Guardiola his biggest challenge both at home and abroad.That poses another question: what if other opponents muster assaults of the intensity and aggression with which Liverpool motored to that 3-0 first-leg lead at Anfield? That performance set the mould for unsettling City.The likelihood is that City will break the spell and, at least, back up last season’s title with another, even if few expect another 19-point margin. Sergio Agüero and Gabriel Jesus will score freely, De Bruyne and Leroy Sané will electrify, John Stones and Aymeric Laporte will continue to mature at the back.Only once, in a final season at Barcelona during which he felt burned out, has Guardiola failed to win consecutive titles with the same team. City’s aim is that he will not have to feel the associated sense of emptiness again. “We’re here to help build a sustainable club,” Al-Mubarak said in 2008. “I think we’re going to have a blast doing it.” He thought correctly and the fun is unlikely to stop any time soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c05b95bf562f3b889782e3d9fb0c66670b7d55c2/249_49_758_455/master/758.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6d155d7ba32bae6364b73aefa3fdc9f","title":"deepika mhatre maid turned comedian mocks india elite","story":"Deepika Mhatre has turned her experiences as a cook for rich families into a standup routineIt is considered insolent in India for a maid to talk back. But one housekeeper in Mumbai is challenging the expectation to be submissive and obedient by lampooning the world of domestic employment in a standup routine several nights a week.“Although my employers were mostly nice to me, I used to hear horror stories from other maids,” Deepika Mhatre, 43, told the . “I used my experiences for my routine, like other comedians,” she said. Mhatre’s daily routine hardly lent itself to laughs. Her day would start at 4am. From 4.30 she travelled on various commuter trains, selling imitation jewellery to passengers on their way to work in downtown Mumbai. By 7am she arrived at the first of five homes in Malad where she cooked.At 2pm she would leave for the 90-minute journey home, where she did her household chores, looked after her ailing, asthmatic husband, who has not worked for 15 years, and their three daughters, and bought and packed jewellery for the next day. At 6pm she would start cooking dinner for the family. These days, however, in the evenings she catches a train into town and performs at one of Mumbai’s comedy clubs. Standup comedy in India is in its infancy. The humour Indians enjoy in private is missing from public life and entertainment, and Bollywood’s idea of humour is slapstick. A maid doing standup comedy is unheard of.On stage, a matronly figure in a salwar kameez and dupatta – a long scarf – with her long hair tied back, she tells the audience she is special. So special that in the building where she works, she says, they have installed a special lift just for her. She pauses. In the homes where she works, they even have special plates and glasses just for her, she says.It takes a second or two before the audience understands that she is satirising the habit across India of forcing domestic staff – maids, cooks, nannies and drivers – to use separate elevators so they don’t “pollute” the lifts used by the rich residents, and to eat off separate plates. Mhatre goes on to talk about how maids have to sit on the floor, use a separate chair or stand in a corner, and she makes fun of how the rich haggle with the poor over a few measly rupees but will happily pay whatever price is marked on goods in a swanky mall.Mhatre’s sets can be seen as an attack on India’s extreme social inequality, and the inability of the rich to treat the poor as their equals. “Why do they do this? It’s because they have no heart, no feeling for poor people,” she said.Mhatre had always made her family crack up. But it was only when one of her employers, Sangeeta Vyas - who Mhatre says was much nicer than most – one day arranged a talent show for people who work as maids or drivers that Mhatre got a chance to perform. “All the other participants sang or danced. I got on stage and talked about madams. The audience liked it.” After a journalist heard about her, she was invited to perform at gigs and received encouragement from Aditi Mittal, a Mumbai comedian who has a web show called Bad Girls, which features unconventional women doing unconventional things. Her two-minute routine has gradually expanded to 10 minutes. “She can mine this madam material – their classist and superior ways – for ages because their behaviour is so ridiculous,” said Mittal.Making fun of oneself is not common in India, where blowing one’s own trumpet is more widespread, but audiences seem to appreciate her self-deprecation – despite the fact that, as Mittal says, she speaks truth to power.The gruelling routine of rising at 4am and getting home at midnight after a gig became too much for her, and two months ago she stopped her cooking work. Now it’s only the jewellery income that supports the family. “It’s tough but I don’t want to give it up. It’s the first opportunity I’ve ever had to be someone.”Given the profoundly subordinate status of maids in India, Mhatre could be forgiven for being worried about any possible repercussions, but she says firmly that “no madam can scare me”.“My struggles in life have made me strong. Appearing on stage has added to my confidence now, so no, I don’t fear any repercussions. In fact, some madams who bumped into me near the lifts spoke politely to me for the first time. Before, I had been invisible.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/285ab3f0c3d92a653c0aa418cc89c41fd79d2b67/275_216_2977_1786/master/2977.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0806c2701460a75d4ca5794f66673ae2","title":"race to contain destructive march of armyworm as pest spreads to india","story":"Voracious caterpillar that cost Africa billions of pounds in lost crops now threatens food security across Asia, scientists warnA crop-chomping caterpillar that has devastated food stocks across Africa has now arrived in southern India, and scientists warn the insect could spread throughout Asia to become a major threat to global food security.The voracious fall armyworm, which was first spotted on the African continent two years ago and has since cost billions of pounds in crop losses, is best known for gnawing on maize but eats an additional 186 plant species, including sorghum and soya beans.Scientists from the Oxfordshire-based Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (Cabi), which developed an action plan to combat the caterpillar’s spread in Africa, now fear that the food security of millions of people across Asia could be at risk if the armyworms are not contained. India produces more than 20m tonnes of maize a year across the subcontinent, enabling the pest to spread rapidly, Cabi warned.“A fast response is important as this pest spreads quickly,” said Dr Gopi Ramasamy, Cabi’s country director for India. “It’s likely fall armyworm arrived in India from Africa through human-aided transport, although natural migration is also a possibility since it’s able to fly hundreds of kilometres in one night on prevailing winds.”Ramasamy said the plan developed and implemented in Africa could be an excellent model to use in India. “Cabi is ready to assist its national partners in India to manage and control fall armyworm.”Native to the Americas, fall armyworm arrived in Nigeria in 2016, and quickly spread across 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. While there it demonstrated a growing appetite for other crops, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, which earmarked $12m (£9.2m) to combat the pest.Invasive species cost the global economy $1.4tn every year. Yet infestations generally go undetected or untreated in their initial stages, which prolongs their spread and makes control more difficult, according to Cabi. “All countries need to be on the alert: the armyworm somehow got from the Americas to Africa and is now in India, so we know it can move long distances,” said Dr Roger Day, Cabi’s programme executive for action on invasives.“From looking at environmental suitability, we can work out which conditions seem to favour the fall armyworm, and southern China and south-east Asia are very suitable for it. In China, which is in the top two maize producers in the world, maize is grown in the north-east, but it’s colder there, so you might get what you see in the Americas … In the winter the pest is in Florida and Texas, but as it warms up, it can get as far as Canada. So China could still be susceptible to migrant populations.” The most popular methods of containing the pest include the use of GM crops and pesticides, said Day, but some armyworms have developed resistance to these tactics and are continuing to blight crops. Cabi is now investigating natural approaches, including breeding predators such as wasps, to be released into fields when necessary, as well as developing a “germ warfare” that isolates diseases to which the caterpillar is prone. “There are lots of ways to kill the fall armyworm, but getting them deployed cost-effectively is the issue,” said Day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1a53d076dacb0bdbd81ef70f4b78c410a800031/0_1389_7723_4631/master/7723.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fbc190a3012e75ea20f2e83865f0541","title":"allbright networking club businesswomen male chairman allan leighton","story":"The AllBright, a recently launched London-based women’s networking club, has startled its supporters by appointing a man, Allan Leighton, as its chair. To the surprise of the club’s founders, Debbie Wosskow and Anna Jones, although not to anyone else’s, this is widely regarded as bonkers.This is a club that claims to be inspired by the first female US secretary of state, Madeleine “there’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help other women” Albright. It has that Virginia Woolf quote (“A woman must have money and a room of her own”) by the front door, the artwork is all by women, even the wine comes from women-run vineyards. It would be fair to say that it has gone to some lengths to establish a brand as the promoter of women in business.So Leighton, despite his record as a promoter of women’s networking initiatives and his experience as chairman of the Co-operative Group, and former boss of Asda and Royal Mail, is going to send a conflicting message. Wosskow admits she is “a little bit surprised” by the reaction. But she has a defence: “There’s a very important factual point here. Allan Leighton is not the CEO of AllBright. Anna Jones and I are the co-founders of AllBright. We appointed him – and it really matters.”Wosskow’s case is that the group is operating amid the uncomfortable realities of scarce finance, where men still control the majority of startup capital, so men have to be brought on board. And on to the board, come to that. “We have raised £9m to drive the growth of the business … we’re hugely grateful to the men who have backed us to change the conversation for women,” she said on the BBC’s Today programme.Professor Jean Hartley at the Open University business school says there is a point about ersity at the top, too. “The chair’s role is to challenge and support. You want ersity in any senior team – a lot of evidence supports that. But I’m not sure about the symbolism of it.”This is an argument about ends and means: you need the money, you take the men. Or at least the man. And while an animal rights organisation, say, might be compromised if it started taking cash from big pharma on the grounds that it has to change big pharma to change the conversation for animals, it is surely harder to argue that a pro-women startup can only take money from women. On the Wosskow defence, Leighton has been taken hostage by two smart women whose steely purpose is to destroy the patriarchy he represents. But could he instead be the City equivalent of Lenin, allowed to cross imperial Germany in his sealed train in 1917 in the knowledge that the revolution he would lead would destroy the war effort of the Kaiser’s Russian enemies?It happens all the time: in June, the English Chess Federation (ECF) appointed Chris – that’s not short for Christine – Fegan as director of women’s chess. In a world where leading male players say things such as “men are hard-wired to be better at chess than women”, this seems almost as much of an own goal as AllBright’s decision to appoint Leighton, although the ECF would probably claim that at least it revived a position it had been prepared to let lapse entirely.Today’s lesson: there is a long way still to go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a6502b2f620e32df7727707f02d35d189d1f945/7_111_4655_2793/master/4655.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63b2818d9bc9f306d76a9e3db13234de","title":"who let snakes out what to do find one in bed","story":"Snakes have been spotted on pavements and in parks, and some are even slithering into houses. Is the heatwave causing a mass breakout?Dave Fawbert says he wasn’t alarmed when he came across a boa constrictor on a high street in east London after popping out to buy a loaf of bread. It wasn’t moving, but the head of a pigeon was disappearing within the snake’s coils. “If it had been slithering around, I’d be more freaked out because you don’t know what it’s going to do,” says Fawbert, an editor at Shortlist, who posted a picture of the gruesome scene on Twitter on Saturday. “I wasn’t scared because it was quite obviously motionless – the bird was halfway down its throat and I thought: ‘There’s no way that snake’s going anywhere.’”A couple of other people had stopped, so he asked if anyone knew where it had come from. “No one seemed to know. It was completely without explanation.” A crowd gathered. One person prodded it. “I just said: ‘Leave it, it’s not a danger to anyone.’” Except to the pigeon, he adds. Fawbert, who had been on a snake-handling experience day earlier in the year for his birthday (“I quite like snakes”), called the RSPCA, worried that people would be scared and try to kill it.This seems to be turning into the summer of escaped snakes. Just over a week ago, a 2.4-metre (8ft) python was discovered in a man’s bathroom in Exeter after he heard toiletries and his toothbrush crashing to the floor, and went to investigate. Stuart Saunders, who is visually impaired, tried to pick up the strange tubular shape on the floor, thinking it was a piece of insulation that had fallen from somewhere, and realised it was a huge snake. He called a friend to help deal with it the python was rescued by a nearby exotic pet shop. It is thought it escaped from there and somehow made it to Saunders’ flat through the plumbing.A few days earlier, a woman in Kensington, west London, woke up to find a 1-metre (3ft) royal python curled up in bed next to her. An RSPCA officer, Jill Sanders, caught it the next evening – it had slithered off and was hiding in the flat. It was thought to be an escaped pet. “Reptiles, particularly snakes, can be extremely good escape artists and will take the opportunity of a gap in an enclosure door or a loose-fitting lid,” Sanders says.Before a race in Battersea Park, south-west London, last week, a snake, thought to be a baby boa constrictor, was found by a runner who had gone into the bushes to relieve himself. The organisers put it in a large plastic tub, says Kate Carter, the ’s life \u0026amp style editor, who was running that day. “They covered it up a bit with a hi-vis bib because someone who seemed to know about snakes thought it was exotic and could be cold, even in heatwave London. They looked after it and called the RSPCA, who came to collect it.”In May, the Manchester Evening News reported that Cordelia, a royal python – thought to be pregnant – had escaped from her home in Wythenshawe. “In the day, she just roams around my flat,” said her owner. “They are very intelligent creatures – which is what makes them good escapists as well. People have suggested Cordelia could still be in the flat somewhere, but I think she’ll have gone for a wander round.”It is still too early to say if the number of stray snakes reported this year will be higher than previous years, but they are more likely to be reported in the summer. “There are a couple of theories why this is happening,” says Nicola White, the senior scientific officer for exotics at the RSPCA. Some snakes may have escaped months ago and haven’t been as active during colder weather, “maybe lying dormant somewhere. Then as soon as the warmer weather starts, they come out because they’re more active naturally in heat. The other reason we think there may be more escapees in summer is that there are owners who like to take their snakes outside to enjoy the warmer weather. In theory, it’s a good thing to do – it’s good for an animal to get natural light, natural warmth – but we would discourage anybody from doing that without keeping the snake secure. The problem is they warm up and become quite fast, and that’s when they could escape.”What should you do if you spot a stray snake? White says you should call the RSPCA. “Our advice is always to keep a safe distance – don’t try to collect the snake yourself, or touch it. Just monitor it so we know where it is.” An officer trained in handling exotic animals will attend – for a standard-size boa constrictor, say, one person can catch it. They carry an “exotics kit”, which consists of a snake hook and a bag that can be tied at the top, and they are taught how to collect the snake safely, using the hook to control the head and gently lift it. To collect a very large snake, such as a reticulated python, which can grow to about 6.5 metres (21ft), two officers would be needed. “For one thing, they’re very heavy,” says White. If a venomous snake is on the loose, a specialist will be brought in.Some snakes will have been abandoned, particularly by people who didn’t realise what they were taking on as a pet. “Before going out and buying a reptile on a whim, we’re desperately asking people to do their research – how long is it going to live for, and how are you going to look after it properly?” But as snakes are good at escaping, “We don’t think all the ones we’re picking up have been dumped or abandoned – it’s quite likely a lot of them are escapees.” Snakes can be microchipped, but many aren’t and reuniting them with their owners is very difficult.The public are not particularly at risk, although Newman thinks our long, hot summer will mean more escapees than usual. “We pick a lot of these animals up and you can almost guarantee that if you get a phone call from someone who has found a snake in their garden, it will be the neighbour’s. It’s not an absolute rule, but almost certainly within three doors away you’ll find where it came from.”How far can they move? “They can move fast in short bursts, so they can disappear quite quickly. They’re wanderers, so they will move until they find somewhere they feel comfortable and secure. They could come from next door, find your bathroom and stay there, as long as there’s food. If there isn’t food, they will move again.” Typically, they will feed once a week, or every two or three weeks. “If there’s not any food, not any mice or anything like that, they will move. They can travel quite a long distance, there’s no limit.” A python or boa constrictor could survive outside at this time of year, but will die during the first frost. “Some of the north American snakes can survive our winters,” says Newman. “It’s not uncommon for a corn snake to escape in the autumn and be found in the spring.”Last year, sewage treatment workers in Llanllyfni, Gwynedd, found a corn snake that had escaped – down the toilet – from a house four months previously and reunited it with the owners. In Glasgow, another corn snake was discovered living in the body work of a Transit van its owner had hired to move house five months earlier – it had wriggled free from its bag and box while being transported. The snake was discovered slithering between the seats by someone else who hired the van.In July, Jake, a 1-metre kingsnake, escaped from his vivarium, probably after breaking out through a small vent. His owner, George Mole, had gone away for a few days, leaving his pet snake – one of three – digesting a frozen chick at home in Nailsworth, Gloucestershire. Jake was found a month later, about half a mile from home, after Mole put a post on a local group on Facebook. “It was a bit of a miracle. I think overjoyed is an understatement,” he says, about being reunited. Though he adds that the 14-year-old whose birthday party Jake crashed didn’t feel quite the same. The party, says Mole, “ended up in lots of screaming”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f9877bb0b8fdfc19f0f00aa77c9999ba8a68fba/0_2_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62371065025a2fa5dfb37cafca67a183","title":"grace jones ghetts glitter the best of bestival 2018","story":"Take a look at the punters and performers who descended on Dorset’s Lulworth Estate for Bestival, including Idles, Songhoy Blues and Chaka Khan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d04041a95d65f1f9bd56f08a49f9f2a5079d9d16/0_160_5360_3216/master/5360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2887aa18ddb0b75d98a65ab98491e24","title":"le mow the 12 hour lawnmower race in pictures","story":"Teams compete all night in an endurance race in West Sussex in the cheapest form of motorsport"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d594f232b3ec1dcc9299e67c6a685011cf6d74f/0_321_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23ea929a108a0ccea1f943918308d1d8","title":"user not found review traverse jeelie piece cafe edinburgh","story":"Traverse at Jeelie Piece Cafe, EdinburghGrappling with both the comfort and toxicity of social media, Chris Goode’s show for Dante or Die is a tender, intimate story of love and letting goTucked in a cafe off the edge of the Meadows in Edinburgh, a roomful of strangers stare down at their phones.

Their creative ales, with distinctive graphic labels designed by local artist Krump, are already taking Brussels bars by storm.

Their beer adventure began cooking up a brew in a bathtub, before opening a microbrewery, where curious beer-lovers would come and watch them working, measuring malted barley and hops like a magic potion. The duo’s signature ale, a delicious malty Tripel brew called Curieuse Neus (the Nosy Kid), became a cult hit, followed by seasonal and experimental ales such as the porter-style Smokey McSmoke and the amber, hoppy Tram Jaune. At the end of 2017 they opened an artisan brewery, near the city’s convention centre, too.• 37 rue Dieudonne Lefevre, enstoemelings.beIn the fashionable Sainte-Catherine area, a frame-maker’s atelier has been transformed into a state-of-the-art brewery, dominated by vast Braukon vats and a modern taproom with 15 draft beers. This is a place for beer enthusiasts to savour weird and wonderful ales in specially-designed tasting glasses, to discuss beer and food pairing, even music and beer pairing. One of the founders, Sébastien Morvan, explains that “while many Belgian brewers are so proud to have made the same beer for 250 years, we create 3-4 beers a month as the process to come out with a recipe is only five weeks.” Popular brews include Babylone, an intriguing “bread bitter” that uses bread during fermentation.• 188 Rue Antoine Dansaert, brusselsbeerproject.beChef Alain Fayt may not brew his own beer – yet – but his enthusiasm for ale led him to create a brilliant restaurant where every dish uses a recipe featuring craft or Trapppist beers, like rabbit braised with prunes and Gueuze (three-course menu €22). Just up the road from the Jeu de Balle flea market, the maze of dining rooms showcase his incredible collections of beer memorabilia. Desserts are memorable, too, from waffles smothered with a cherry Kriek coulis or Hercules stout chocolate mousse.• 9 Rue des Renards, + 32 25115583, restobieres.euJust outside the city centre, the Molenbeek neighbourhood has been in the news for the wrong reasons over the last few years but Bruxellois also know it as the venue of a beer revolution hatched at the city’s dominant craft brewery, La Brasserie de la Senne. One of the founders, Yvan de Baets, explains: “We like to think we are a little different from other artisanal breweries around the world as we have not jumped on what I would call the IPA bandwagon. We are inspired by traditional Belgian beers but add a modern touch.” You will find its brews in every bar in town, with stand outs such as the light-blonde Taras Boulba, powerful, malty Brusseleir, or Stouterik, a light Belgo-Irish stout. The brewery has its own taproom (Mon-Fri, 9am-3pm) where a draft costs from €2.50.• 565 Chaussee de Gand, brasseriedelasenne.beThe sprawling Jeu de Balle flea market is a Brussels must-see and the ancient cobbled square is surrounded by many bars packed out with street traders and bargain hunters. Most are drinking Jupiler, the quaffable local pils, or classic Trappist ales such as Orval and Chimay, served in their own distinctive glass. But La Brocante stands out for its remarkable craft-beer selection. The bar rocks at the weekend, with lunchtime jazz and blues concerts, generous platefuls of traditional Brussels grub: don’t miss the “stoemp”, a Belgian take on sausages and mash.

He was a justice of the peace in Yazoo City, the gateway to the fertile, brutal lands of the Delta.“Effie, it’s just been a bad day,” the lawman said to his sister, as the six-year-old listened. “I just had to go cut a black boy down off that hanging tree and take him to his mama.”The infamous tree, used for lynching, was bending over a bridge on Highway 433 toward Lexington.“What did he do?” Effie Luby asked.“He raped and killed a white woman.”Lindy, now 66, has shifted her stance on the death penalty. After she sat on a jury that condemned a man to death, she now campaigns for alternatives to execution and stars in a new documentary about her experience.The first cut of the film also showed Lindy and husband, Ira Isonhood, flying the Confederate battle flag on a 20ft pole in the backyard of one of their homes.To many white people in the south and beyond, the Confederate flag is a sign of historic pride and defiance to whatever is currently called “liberalism” to most black Americans, the flag stands for white supremacy and racial violence. Today, the symbol often appears at “pro-white” rallies and is a lightning rod in America’s calcifying racial ides.The flag’s history is fraught and complicated, as was the bloody civil war that erupted in 1861 between the US south – where America’s slave trade had relocated and expanded by the mid-1800s – and the north. After the north won, it imposed a harsh Reconstruction on the south that still fuels white resentment today.The post-war white south embraced the Confederate battle flag, making it their sentimental symbol of the “lost cause” of the war. By the time Mississippi embedded it into its new state flag in 1894, the flag was used to both honor the Confederate dead as well as a romanticized version of the war’s purpose.By the mid-20th century, the flag symbolized white resistance to ending segregation laws. The Ku Klux Klan flew it at lynching parties and angry mobs waved it outside public schools as black children enrolled in front of white “segregation academies” and next to leering dogs unleashed on black protesters wanting the right to vote. (Today, its supporters say the KKK co-opted it.) In April 2001, Mississippians voted along race lines to keep the flag as it was. The debate reignited in 2015 after Dylann Roof killed nine black people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. A photo soon emerged of him holding a Confederate flag. The matter is especially raw in Mississippi, a state that suffered tremendous Confederate casualties and went from being the richest state from slavery before the civil war to one of the poorest.The Isonhoods were the first stop of my May 2018 listening tour of Mississippi with photographer Kate Medley to ask flag supporters in our home state why they still support a symbol that represents so much pain, ision and difficult history – even as they urge black Americans to get over their resistance to it.Ira Isonhood, 71, remembers his father inviting black people to sit in his yard to watch a basketball game through the window when he got the area’s first television – a progressive move in the mid-20th century south. But he was still a product of his time.One day, a black boy came to his dad’s store with a shopping list his mother had signed with “Mrs”. His father sent a note back with no groceries. When her husband came later, the storekeeper admonished him in front of young Ira. “Don’t ever allow your wife to sign ‘Mrs’ again!” he warned.Still, Ira flies the flag, which his own high school and college used as an emblem.“The Confederate flag played a big, big part in our history,” Ira says. “… Why are these minorities pushing to do away with this flag? Look at what’s happening to our statues!” he says.Neither Ira nor Lindy has asked black acquaintances why the flag is offensive, or asked why many believe it belongs in museums, but not part of a state emblem. “I don’t think the black people around here care,” Lindy says.She wonders why the flag is once again becoming a big deal. “Is it their feelings? … Mississippi has bent over backwards to say I’m sorry. How much more do we need to do?”I later relay Lindy’s questions to Genesis Be, a 31-year-old hip-hop artist, public speaker and anti-Confederate flag activist from Biloxi. I met Be after reporting that her grandfather, Pastor Clyde Briggs, was a target of the Klan in the 1960s for trying to organize and arm black people against white supremacy. I have stuck my finger into a bullet hole in her family home where the Klan fired into the wall above where her aunt, then a child, slept.“What has Mississippi done to say that it is sorry for the rape, torturing and killings of scores of its black citizens in order to create a white majority?” Be says. “Open a museum?”“I’ve never heard of an apology from the Klan in Franklin County for harassing and assaulting my family while flying that flag. All I’ve heard is a downplaying and whitewashing of history in an attempt to gaslight its population.”Ongoing inequities, Be reminds, are bolstered by a kinder, gentler version of Confederate history rewritten after the south lost the civil war and its rights to maintain and extend slavery.After driving north along the lonely stretch of Highway 49 through Delta plantation lands, we end up in Larry McCluney Jr’s attic in Greenwood.The room is a shrine to the Confederacy with a rebel-flag-themed cushion, curtains and even a mousepad. There’s also a civil war chess set. The closet is packed with battle re-enactment costumes and weapon replicas.McCluney, 53, is a national officer in the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which accepts male descendants of southern soldiers. SCV was created in 1896 for the “vindication of the cause for which we fought” and to ensure “that a true history of the 1861-1865 period is preserved.” SCV members worked with the United Confederate Veterans and other groups in the early 20th century to demand school textbooks supporting the revisionist view that the south fought for a just “lost cause” that was decidedly not slavery. McCluney has taught history and government for 25 years to mostly black Delta students.“People like me … it’s in our blood. We know about our family, their sacrifices,” he says of his 20 ancestors who fought for the Confederacy.“Slavery was an issue, but not the cause,” the teacher tells me. He repeats SCV’s selective semantics with precision: the south seceded over “states’ rights” to financial independence the north and Abraham Lincoln weren’t against slavery at the outset northern tariffs were killing the south few southerners and soldiers owned humans slavery was fading anyway and it wasn’t about white supremacy.The facts are more complicated. Despite decades of efforts to renovate history, Mississippi’s Declaration of Secession still begins by clarifying that the state left the union in 1861 for a cause “thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery,” adding for posterity that “none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun” that enables cotton to flourish.By 1861, the south was demanding slavery expansion into western territories, which Lincoln’s “Black Republicans” adamantly opposed. The SCV is correct, though, that Lincoln did not initially call for emancipation. In fact, Frederick Douglass called Lincoln “preeminently the white man’s president, entirely devoted to the welfare of white men.”In his attic, McCluney downplays slavery ownership – saying “elite” planters, not soldiers, owned most slaves. “Most (southerners) did not have a dog in the hunt,” he says. But slavery was waning, McCluney insists, and the north should have let it fade naturally. After I mention that Mississippi outlawed freeing slaves in 1857, he said that the south wouldn’t have seceded if the federal government had allowed (white, male) voters to decide slavery per state or territory.McCluney teaches his black students his Confederate history. “I try to be sensitive. I’m a pointblank person. Don’t ask if you don’t want to know.” But, he adds, “they know me as a teacher who cares about them”.The educator points to Roof’s “horrible, horrible” 2015 massacre of black worshippers – and his viral photo holding the Confederate flag – as inciting a war on the emblem. “Politically correct groups seized that opportunity to make it seem like that flag came down that pole, walked down into that church and killed those people,” he says. “… That was horrific to my organization (SCV) when that took place.”I later share those words with Derrick Johnson, the national president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), who previously led the Mississippi chapter.“Wow,” he says, then pauses.Then Johnson turns to Roof: “All of the views and racial hatred symbols that informed his opinion walked into that church with him. He’s more than enough reason that the symbols of the Confederacy should be removed from the public square.”Thomasa Massey, 49, jumps out of her car at Pearl Park in a majority-white Jackson suburb wearing a T-shirt with Confederate butterflies she designed with “Pride, Not Prejudice” underneath.When I had interviewed her about being in a white gang, I saw her defending the flag on Facebook. Her friend Evangela Hentz, who is black, opens the passenger door, and we all run through the rain to a pavilion. The two single mothers finish each other’s sentences, laughing about that time Hentz went into labor where they worked and Massey put her in an office chair to wheel her downstairs to go to the hospital. “I have struggled. She’s helped me. She’s struggled. I’ve been there for her,” Massey, the child’s godmother, says.“We just didn’t believe in racism. Nobody, my whole town,” she says.The Confederate flag represents pride in the face of poverty to Massey, who came to Mississippi in 2001, the same year voters decided against changing the state flag. She supports Mississippians’ right to keep it as is. “It was there when our grandfathers, great-grandfathers, were struggling to feed their six, eight, 10 kids. It flew for all colors, black, white, whatever,” she says.Hentz, 41, is from Missouri, once a violent slave state, but calls the flag just an “inanimate object,” adding: “Stop letting it control you.”“If you don’t breathe life into something, it will die,” Massey adds.The friends reject being offended over what Hentz calls “just a piece of cloth”.Be, who discusses the flag respectfully with friends who like it, challenges Massey, Hentz and others to probe deeper.“It was poor white southerners who fought in these battles, being strung along by rich, property-owning whites who banked on the ignorance and arrogance of the poor whites to fight and die in the war,” Be says.“They gave their life, but for what?”Gentlemanly Kevin Davis is surprised when we show up at his large white antebellum-style house in Simpson County. We are stopping by homes with flags, but owners keep pointing us on down the road to him.Davis – no relation to Jeff – has taught history in public and private schools, and also turned out to be an SCV member. Thirteen of his ancestors fought for the south, but most didn’t own slaves. Three died in battle, and one in a makeshift hospital in the Lyceum at Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi – one of numerous buildings built by slaves.“To me, the flag is not a racist thing. It’s a piece of our heritage that should be left there to honor sacrifices,” Davis says in a cozy parlor, adding that most soldiers were “dirt-poor farmers” with no slaves. Davis, 47, also believes the institution might have died out due to “modernization … if they were able to compromise another 20 years. That’s what state’s rights were about: protecting slavery,” he says. “… There would not have been a war over tariffs.”Most Confederacy fans may cherry-pick their side’s history, but many are more precise about the chinks in the Yankees’ armor – including that not everyone up north was hip to slavery ending, either.And, as McCluney points out, New York-financed slave ships kept sailing to West Africa for people to be sold in the Caribbean and South America.Davis is circumspect on the complicated history: “I can say it was wrong, and I hope I wouldn’t have participated in (slavery), but how can we know for sure?”Still, Davis balks at the need to exorcise the emblem from the state flag today out of respect to Mississippians who descended from slaves. His own ancestors’ sacrifice is paramount. “It’s so we don’t forget,” he says.The history teacher could handle it if the state flag changed, though. “I would be sad about it, not violently upset. I would not be up around the last flag making a chain gang to keep somebody from taking it down,” Davis says.We’re on Highway 49 south when it pops up: Flag Heads, which sells “adult novelties” and Confederate tchotchkes.“You won’t find it at Wal*Mart,” a large sign proclaims, reminding shoppers that the retailer dropped Confederate merchandise within a week of Roof’s massacre.If you can put a rebel flag on it, they do: beach towels, BBQ aprons, windshield dice, coasters, flip-flops, polar fleeces, bikinis, umbrellas and more. Pipes fill a glass case, and we avoid the curtained adult room.Petite Roslyn Stuart is behind the counter with a swagger like she has seen it all more than once. She immediately brings up Roof.“Until that kid went in that church in Charleston, people never thought anything about the Confederate or Mississippi flag,” she says. “… The flag not gon’ change the hate.”Stuart blames detractors. “It’s not us that’s racial it’s them that’s racial. Most of ’em don’t know what it means,” she says. “It’s a symbol of our state it’s who we are.”She continues: “Northern people were down here trying to burn all our stuff” – true the Yankees torched Jackson three times – “and we were trying to stop them … They didn’t think it was right we had slaves. It turned into one big heckuva mess. It’s lingering still out there.”She worries that young people now think the flag stands for the KKK. “Eventually, they will take the state flag they will change it. What’s next? The Christian flag?” she asks.A black FedEx man wouldn’t come through the front door, she says, instead leaving heavy packages on the porch because “he thinks we’re racial”. So she asked for a new driver and got one.“Come on over!” Joe Barnes booms, describing his nearby Seminary home as the one with the US, Confederate and Mississippi flags out front, after I tell him Roslyn sent us.Barnes, 66, beams as he hands us his SCV card with Nathan Bedford Forrest, the wealthy Memphis slave trader and first KKK grand wizard, pictured on the front.Retired military, Barnes used to attend all the Ole Miss college football games, but he now watches on TV. He wrote the chancellor that he would never buy another ticket after the game ban of the rebel flag.“Our ancestors fought under that flag,” Barnes says. “It’s not about hatred.” He adds that blacks fought for the south, too. (True, but usually for their masters. Many defected to segregated union camps.)“Schools are not teaching history the right way,” he says. “… It’s not whites that are the racists it’s mostly the blacks … What it boils down to is black people are just trying to overrule us.”“If we can’t get white people to stand together, it’s going to be another civil war,” he adds.Barnes has black friends, he says, and points out that African Americans use the N-word. “White folks can be that, too. There are trashy white people and trashy black people.”SCV is not racist or violent, he says. “The Klan is different from us. The SCV might fly the flag, but we don’t associate with them. We’re not a violent organization. We try to help people.”Johnson, CEO of the NAACP, says he wishes poor whites would recognize how powerful politicians have long played racial politics with Confederate emblems – a deliberate strategy to ide them from people with shared economic interests.“The very same people that exploit the working class for cheap labor and create systems to undermine their development through poor education systems use issues of racial ision to maintain economic control,” the NAACP president says.The flag could easily be honored or studied in museums, he adds.“The NAACP respects the constitutional, first amendment right for private citizens to maintain symbols and monuments on private property,” he says. “Enjoy.”“Can you tell me why?”On the last day, I again sit with Lindy Isonhood, this time at Deer Hollow, their other home farther south where Ira’s Confederate man cave, as Kate is calling the rooms we’ve seen, is packed with deer antlers, a boar’s head trophy, and little rebel flags. Ira is in the backyard posing for pictures in front of his Confederate flag.Lindy has thought about our first conversation overnight and wants to understand why I do not support the flag.“The war really was about slavery, and they didn’t hide it then,” I say as she listens intently. “But I don’t believe everyone who likes the flag is racist. Many people were taught certain things.”I add that the ision most hurts poor whites and people of color.Lindy nods, describing her childhood of poverty when the family’s land was all they had left. Her sister would exchange clothes with a black friend, she says. “My family, we were poor. When I graduated from high school, we didn’t have an indoor toilet.”“I am going to start researching this,” she adds about the history as Kate calls for her. Knowing that Lindy now talks to other Mississippians after rethinking the death penalty, I feel a twinge of hope as I watch Ira’s rebel flag flying outside the window of Deer Hollow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37eb14c2584b465cc650de3b4f273d1118e66603/0_697_1606_963/master/1606.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=138577a2cd72a32215c5a56cee475754","title":"italy tanker truck explodes on motorway near bologna airport","story":"At least two killed and dozens injured in Italy after blast spreads fire and debrisAt least two people have been killed and more than 60 others injured after two trucks collided on a motorway near Bologna airport in northern Italy.A lorry carrying cars collided on a bridge with a tanker lorry containing flammable materials, local reports said.The blast, which engulfed the area with flames and black smoke and caused a bridge to partially collapse, occurred near Borgo Panigale to the west of the city, the Italian fire service tweeted.Italian media reported that many of the injured were hit by debris and glass after the explosion.Firefighters have since extinguished the blaze, a spokesman said, adding that efforts were under way to ascertain the cause of the explosion and the number of victims.A video published on Twitter by the fire service showed a huge column of black smoke billowing from the wreckage of the truck on the city’s ring road.Images released earlier by the fire service showed burning cars in an adjacent car park."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48353bf51ea1da42870d6a4e5357ba6c545cf7d0/0_67_2800_1679/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71e910f19984b8890dd48e3a959ce76b","title":"north korea frustrates us maximum pressure eases sanctions","story":"Pyongyang appears to be evading curbs with help of lax approach by China and RussiaWithout the spectre of imminent nuclear war, there is not much appetite for strict enforcement of international sanctions aimed at forcing North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and missile programmes.There is a mounting body of evidence that Pyongyang is evading the restrictions with a combination of subterfuge and lax enforcement by China and Russia, its closest allies, rendering the US plan of “maximum pressure” increasingly ineffective.In two high-profile and historic meetings this year, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, agreed to “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, but has done little to curb weapons development. The US has demanded Kim give up his nukes before any sanctions are lifted.North Korea has used a variety of means to sidestep the restrictions. Ship-to-ship transfers of oil and coal in the dead of night have been repeatedly documented, North Korean labourers work openly in China and Russia, and Pyongyang continues to work with Syria’s military.“Kim Jong-un is playing a very logical game. He’s getting weaker sanctions enforcement from China and Russia while engaging the United States on his terms,” said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who worked on North Korea policy.“If it’s possible to weaken the resolve of China and other members of the international community to impose and enforce sanctions, that’s certainly in North Korea’s interest. But North Korea isn’t so committed to that goal that it would give up its nuclear programme.”More than 10,000 North Korean workers have registered to work in Russia since September, with at least 700 obtaining work permits this year, in potential violation of UN sanctions, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. US officials estimate North Koreans working in Russia send as much as $300m (£230m) a year to Pyongyang, a critical source of foreign currency.In a sign of growing frustration, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, publicly warned Russia and China last week against weakening sanctions enforcement during a trip to Singapore.His plea came as a panel of UN experts tasked with monitoring sanctions implementations said Pyongyang had continued its nuclear and missiles programmes, and documented a host of violations including attempts to sell weapons to armed groups in Yemen and exporting more than $100m in textiles over a six-month period.North Korea “has not stopped its nuclear and missile programmes and continued to defy security council resolutions through a massive increase in illicit ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products, as well as through transfers of coal at sea during 2018”, the report said, according to a Reuters report.North Korean coal has even turned up at South Korean ports, which has long had a ban on products from the North.Amid the growing list of apparent sanctions violations, North Korea’s state-controlled media has begun calling for the US to drop the restrictions, saying its moratorium on missile and nuclear tests, the dismantling of its only known nuclear test site and the return of Korean war dead was enough.“There have been outrageous arguments coming out of the US state department that it won’t ease sanctions until a denuclearisation is completed, and reinforcing sanctions is a way to raise its negotiating power,” the Rodong Sinmun newspaper, a ruling Workers’ party mouthpiece, said in a front-page editorial. “How could the sanctions, which were a stick the US administration had brandished as part of its hostile policy against us, promote the two countries’ amity?”Several other North Korean outlets also criticised the pressure campaign as “anachronistic” and an obstacle to better relations. The complaints may be a sign sanctions are still a significant hurdle to trade or could merely be a negotiating tactic.“Maximum pressure has lost all steam,” added Jackson, now a senior lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington. “One of the perverse consequences of the nuclear crisis last year was that nobody wanted a return to that precarious situation, and virtually everyone was willing to accept any outcome that assured we didn’t return to the brink of a nuclear war.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da1f53e838cc8b9f41014cf7f2196637293efcf7/0_314_5551_3331/master/5551.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c24516b6c7cbabce175190ec8f63b71","title":"the gru the russian intelligence agency behind the headlines","story":"Accusations mount against the Russian army’s main intelligence directorateIn Russia’s shadow war with the west, one intelligence agency keeps making headlines.The GRU, or main intelligence directorate, of the Russian army, has been accused of spearheading several of Russia’s most notorious operations in recent years. They include the 2014 seizure of Crimea using undercover soldiers called “little green men”, the hacking theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton, and even the planning of a failed coup in Montenegro. A British security source told the  on Monday that the nerve agent attack on the former double agent Sergei Skripal was also ordered by the intelligence agency. The British government is poised to submit an extradition request to Moscow for two Russians suspected of carrying out the Salisbury attack that left one person dead and three injured, including Skripal and his daughter.One of the three main Russian intelligence agencies, less has been written about the GRU (now officially called the GU, or Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces) than its sister agencies, particularly the Soviet-era KGB or its modern successor the FSB, the spy agency once headed by Vladimir Putin.Known for operating under a wartime mentality and a willingness to take risks, experts say the culture of the GRU has been influenced by its inclusion of Spetsnaz special forces and experience in war zones, including Syria and Ukraine.“The GRU regards itself as a war-fighting instrument. Yes, it gathers conventional intelligence … but its culture is much more military,” said Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian security issues and the country’s intelligence agencies. “Although only a minority of GRU officers are Spetsnaz, it has an impact when part of your service are commandos.”Besides special forces, the spy agency manages more traditional intelligence-gathering operations around the world, as well as signals intelligence. Vladimir Rezun, a GRU officer who defected to the UK in the 1970s, wrote in his history of the agency (written under the pen name Viktor Suvorov) that it was largely tasked with preventing the collapse of the Soviet Union from without, as opposed to the KGB, which had a prominent role in thwarting internal threats.While the KGB became notorious, the GRU largely operated in obscurity. “In the people’s consciousness, everything that is dark, underground and secret is connected with the KGB but not at all with the GRU,” he wrote.Traditionally, Galeotti noted, the GRU answered for “uncontrolled spaces”. While in the past that has meant areas like civil wars, it may also apply to zones like cyberspace now. Several Russian intelligence agencies were involved in hacking operations before the 2016 US presidential elections, but only the GRU was identified in an 11-count indictment released last month by the United States special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The hack was perpetrated by staff employees of several Moscow-based units traditionally tied to signal intelligence. The interests of Russia’s intelligence agencies regularly overlap, as have their methods. As Christopher Andrew wrote in The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West, his study of notes on KGB files smuggled out of Russia, the agency “offered its allies lethal nerve toxins and poisons which were fatal on contact with the skin for use during ‘special actions’”.While the GRU has largely been shrouded in secrecy, there have been occasional contacts with the west. Peter Zwack, a retired US army brigadier general, wrote about a series of meetings before the Sochi Olympics with the head of the GRU, Igor Sergun, who died unexpectedly of a heart attack in January 2016. “I found him soft-spoken, unassuming, complex, erudite and nuanced,” he said of their meetings, which largely focused on counter-terrorism efforts. “I learned that even as Sergun relentlessly directed global intelligence operations against our interests, he — paradoxically — also viewed constant confrontation with the US and west as not in Russia’s best long-term interest,” Zwack wrote.Those meetings ended after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Iranians have been anxiously bracing for a new round of hardship over the return of sanctions, which will compound the country’s economic woes. Its currency has been sent into a tailspin in recent months, fuelling street protests over economic grievances, a lack of social and political freedoms and growing environmental challenges. Some analysts fear the country is on an economic and political precipice.“There’s a sense of anguish in Iranian society – everyone is worried and waiting,” said Sadegh Zibakalam, a professor of politics at Tehran University.“There is no hope that the situation will get better. People think that in the best-case scenario, it won’t get worse. Among the youth you see a huge tendency to leave the country,” he said.The EU is attempting to protect European businesses from the sanctions, vowing to safeguard firms doing “legitimate business”. Companies have been instructed that they should not comply with demands from the White House for them to drop all business with Iran. Those who decide to pull out because of US sanctions will need to be granted authorisation from the European commission, without which they face the risk of being sued by EU member states.The Trump administration said on Monday it was not particularly concerned by the EU decision and that the US strategy was designed to apply maximum pressure on Tehran. Ultimately, the US administration wants a new deal that it says will address “the totality of the Iranian threat”.They are going to be such a wealthy, such a powerful nation, they\u0027re going to have nuclear weapons, the Republican presidential frontrunner says. They are going to take over parts of the world that you wouldn\u0027t believe and I think it\u0027s going to lead to nuclear holocaust.\u0026nbspTrump says his number one priority is to dismantle the nuclear agreement. This deal is catastrophic for Israel, for America, for the whole of the Middle East, he says.The White House signals a tougher stance towards Iran, condemning a recent missile test and declaring America is putting the Islamic republic on notice following its malign actions. Trump tweets: Iran is playing with fire – they don\u0027t appreciate how \u0027kind\u0027 President Obama was to them. Not me!Trump calls on all countries to isolate Iran, in a speech in Riyadh. From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms and trains terrorists, militias and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region, he declares.Trump says the nuclear accord is an embarrassment to the United States. He tells the UN general assembly that Iran\u0027s government turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state.Trump says it is time for change in Iran, after days of deadly protests against the government in Tehran. A day later he denounces the brutal and corrupt regime.Trump pulls the US out of the nuclear pact. Describing the deal as defective at its core, he says: Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie. Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States.Iran\u0027s president, Hassan Rouhani, tells the US it should not play with the lion\u0027s tail and warns that any conflict with Iran would be the mother of all wars. Trump responds with an all-caps Twitter tirade: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.Trump says he is open to a new Iran deal, while confirming a return to sanctions. I remain open to reaching a more comprehensive deal that addresses the full range of the regime\u0027s malign activities, including its ballistic missile program and its support for terrorism, he says in a statement.On Monday night, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, dismissed the new round of sanctions as “psychological warfare” designed to help Trump’s allies in the upcoming mid-term elections.He reassured Iranians that his government was able to stave off pressure from the US, but said it was only possible if different factions within the country showed unity. “Our system is stable, we’re all standing together,” he said. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said on Monday that enemies were pulling out all the stops to target “Iran’s existence”, pledging that his country “will overcome this period of hardship”. Rouhani’s administration is scrambling to mitigate the impact of sanctions and their effect on the plummeting value of the national currency by easing foreign exchange rules. Homeira, a 31-year-old graduate of management living in Chalus, in northern Iran, said: “You can’t describe the scale of the crisis the country is facing.“Life goes on, but how it goes on is the issue. Inflation and currency depreciation has made life so costly – it’s as if you have to pay even for the oxygen you’re breathing. But worse than all of this is you don’t have a right to say anything in protest. A lot of people think there should be another revolution, but I believe another revolution will make things worse. We need to fix the current situation.” Ehsan, who sells vehicle parts in Karaj, a city west of Tehran that has been the focal point of recent protests, said: “The situation is dreadful. In a country that is sitting on oil, copper, gold, gas, people are left without electricity and water for four hours per day.”At least one person is reported to have been killed during clashes between protesters and security guards in Karaj in the past week. Mohammad Eslami, 34, the international director of Shenasa Venture Capital, said fluctuations in the exchange rate had made it “really hard to have an investment plan” in the country. Eslami said ordinary people’s purchasing power was likely to decrease still further under sanctions. “It will make life harder,” he predicted. The US sanctions will pose a challenge for Rouhani and other moderate politicians, Eslami said.“If the Rouhani administration shows a real will to defeat corruption, increase transparency, and restructuring the economy, they will turn the threat into an opportunity.”Internally, many prominent Iranians believe the pressure from the US is mainly intended to provoke regime change. The reformist ex-president Mohammad Khatami, one of the most popular politicians inside Iran but who is currently sidelined, was quoted by local media as saying that efforts to engineer regime change would prove futile so long as people believed in reform. Khatami has set out 15 suggestions to Iranian leaders to bring the country out of the political deadlock. His suggestions include the release of all political prisoners, and establishment of a free atmosphere for political activities. Some names have been changed to protect identities.

There, it speeds up the loss of ice from the Antarctic. As the heat rises, more rain falls in forested regions and the wettened soil is less able to trap planet-warming methane. Ocean floors give up even more methane, heating the planet further still.We will pause there to explain this is not a sequel to The Day After Tomorrow but an illustration of what leading climate scientists fear could happen if “positive feedback loops” are allowed to take hold – by which warming temperatures release new sources of greenhouse gases or destroy the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon and reflect heat, causing a spiral into a “hothouse” world. They ask whether the planet’s temperature can stabilise at 2C above pre-industrial levels, or whether it will tip towards being 4C warmer and far less supportive of human life.“I do hope we are wrong, but as scientists we have a responsibility to explore whether this is real,” said Johan Rockström, one of the authors of a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “We could end up delivering the Paris agreement and keep to 2C of warming, but then face an ugly surprise if the system starts to slip away.” Dr Phil Williamson, a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia, said: “In the context of the summer of 2018, this is definitely not a case of crying wolf, raising a false alarm: the wolves are now in sight.”Labour backs off in Hodge row – Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who called Jeremy Corbyn “an antisemite and a racist” in the House of Commons, has denied party claims that she expressed “regret” for doing so. Disciplinary action against her has been dropped but “just to be clear: there have been no apologies – on either side,” said Hodge, who accosted Corbyn over his handling of Labour’s dispute with Jewish community leaders.Italy explosion – At least two people area dead and more than 60 others injured after a lorry hauling a tanker of flammable materials exploded in a collision near Bologna airport.The blast sent up a fireball and partly collapsed a bridge on a motorway at Borgo Panigale in northern Italy. Authorities said many of the injured had been hit by debris and flying glass.Symbolic novichok arrest bid – Britain will make an almost certainly futile attempt to have the suspects in the Salisbury novichok poisonings extradited from Russia. Authorities are blaming two Russians for the exposure of Sergei Skripal, Yulia Skripal and Charlie Rowley, and the death of Dawn Sturgess. Police and intelligence agencies have pieced together the movements of the two Russians, from their entry into the UK through to their departure. Vladimir Putin rejected a similar extradition request in 2007 for two Russians suspected of being behind the 2006 assassination with polonium of the former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London. Here is why the chance of Putin acceding in this instance is basically zero.Manafort on trial – Onetime Trump apparatchiks Rick Gates and Paul Manafort were partners in crime who colluded to hide Manafort’s millions of dollars in shady foreign income from tax authorities, a court has heard. Gates testified that Manafort directed him to report overseas income as loans in order to lower his taxable income. Manafort is on trial for bank fraud and tax evasion. Prosecutors allege he failed to report a “significant percentage” of the more than $60m they say he received from Ukrainian oligarchs. Gates is Manafort’s former deputy and is testifying against him under a plea bargain.Xi not a Pooh fan – Chinese censors have reportedly blocked the release of Christopher Robin, a new film adaptation about Winnie the Pooh – the portly cartoon bear who is used to mock President Xi Jinping.The similarity was first noted when Xi visited the US in 2013 and was photographed walking alongside the lanky President Obama, and things have gone on from there. Xi is very sensitive about the comparison: the TV station HBO had its website blocked in China after comedian John Oliver mentioned it.But in 2013 regulators stepped in and forced payday lenders to clean up their act. Wonga had to cancel debts of borrowers who should never have been given loans. And claims management firms targeting payday lenders on behalf of customers have set off a renewed torrent of complaints. Company losses were £80m in 2015 and £66m in 2016. “When Wonga was in the market they were making money,” says James Daley, from campaign group Fairer Finance. “Now they are handing it all back again.”UK Sport’s policy of “no compromise” – which rewards successful sports and rips funding from those that fail – has finally come up for debate with Ed Warner’s call for change in the “bloated” and “flawed” Olympic sport funding system putting the focus on medals in the spotlight.David Richardson, chief executive of the ICC, has complained about the amount of cheating and sledging in international cricket and said that players and coaches have to do more to improve behaviour. Chris Ashton has revealed he is set to play at full-back for Sale following his move back to the Premiership, less than a week after Eddie Jones handed him an England recall and claimed that being on the wing was his best position. Thibaut Courtois has made clear his desire to leave Chelsea before the closure of the transfer window this month by failing to report back for pre‑season training. And Serena Williams has said concerns over motherhood have affected her recent form after she lost 6-1, 6-0 in just 52 minutes to Britain’s Johanna Konta last week.US sanctions against Iran came into force at midnight. But the EU is telling European companies to ignore Washington’s demand that they drop all business with Tehran.

The entrance was “ framed by 1960s traffic engineering, is low key, nondescript and unfriendly to pedestrians and cyclists”.The overall design will involve the development of seven new quadrangles of open green space, a new pedestrian spine, parallel to the campus’ original walkway, lined with weather canopies that double as solar connectors, to form the infrastructure of an energy network. Cafes and social spaces will be located along paths with landscaped areas surrounding water-retention ponds, along with rain- and wind-protected seating areas and preserved specimen trees.The main design centre building, set by a plaza and a reflecting pool, will feature two vertical structures angled at 23 degrees, “mirroring the Earth’s tilt”. Its auditorium has been designed to echo the shape of UCD’s dodecahedral 1972 water tower the “centre’s towers respond to the water tower’s pentagonal pillar”, according to the designers.University president Andrew Deeks described the building as “ intriguing and striking”. “The centre for creative design promises to be an exhilarating presence, announcing UCD from afar, creating a new Dublin landmark, and giving visitors, students and faculty a definite sense of arrival.”A spokeswoman for the project said details on the height of the building were not yet available as it was a “concept” design only.“The design will now be developed in consultation with UCD, stakeholders and planners and will take many, many months of detailed design work before the final planning applications are made.”The university hopes the work will be completed by 2021, she said.The creation of a new entrance and landmark building at the dual carriageway side of the Belfield campus was central to a previous campus development plan in 2004, but was shelved after the financial crash in 2008.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneTHE IRISH TIMESIf only Sunday’s World Cup final had been a singing competition and not a hockey match, the medals brought home by the Irish team would have been gold and not silver.The Irish women danced the conga and began singing as they boarded the plane for home following Sunday’s final defeat to the Netherlands which they lost 6-0.They didn’t stop when they reached Dublin Airport, nor on the bus into the city centre. By the time the public homecoming moved to Dame Street, there were a few voices frayed at the edges, but they carried on regardless.This was a joyous and at times, emotional, homecoming. At Dublin Airport many members of the squad cried when the Minister for Sport Shane Ross announced there would be a further €1.5 million funding for Irish teams preparing for the 2020 Toyko Olympics, a substantial portion of which will go to Irish hockey.Perhaps, the realisation that public thanks went beyond mere platitudes provoked the tears.They will hold Mr Ross to that promise, though Ireland’s star performer at the championship, goalkeeper Ayeisha McFerran (22), opined that it was the least they deserved.“We have been asking him for a while for far more funding so that we can get on to that platform that we know we can achieve,” she said.A crowd estimated at 5,000 turned out to greet the squad in Dame Street. It consisted mostly of young girls and judging by the numbers who cheered when they were asked if they were members of a club, this was predominantly a gathering of the hockey clans.Proud father and former Ireland rugby international Phillip Matthews, whose daughter Hannah was one of the stalwart Irish performers, enumerated all the ways in which the team surpassed their expectations. “It’s much easier playing that watching it as a spectator let me tell you,” he said. “I’m so proud of all of them.”Host Des Cahill confessed, that like most of the rest of us, he knew little about hockey before the World Cup tournament in London started, but he did understand one incontrovertible fact: “Irish people love medals. The country fell in love with you.”Each of the 18 squad members were introduced to the crowd. All had a story to tell. Substitute goalkeeper Grace O’Flanagan is a qualified doctor who often turned up for training in her scrubs after a 24 hour shift.Midfielder Lizzie Colvin is getting married in October and invited all 17 squad members as bridesmaids. “It’s too late to take it back now,” she joked.Emily Beatty had glitter in her handbag and was getting ready to cheer on her teammates when she got the call on Sunday morning, five hours before the game, to play in the World Cup final, as you do.“I got a taxi and said, ‘it’s an emergency, I’m playing in the World Cup final’,” she said.She replaced Megan Frazer who who had her own tale of woe relating to a series of injuries s to make the tournament.The homecoming in Dublin ended with a few showstoppers. The squad’s piece is All I Want for Christmas Is You. A Christmas song in the middle of summer, you might ask? Then again a team which reached the World Cup final despite being the second lowest ranked team is capable of anything.Captain Katie Mullen rated their rendition of the Mariah Carey standard on the morning of the World Cup final as the stand-out moment of their week.“It has been a bit of a tradition that the night before a game was like Christmas Eve and then the game itself was like Christmas morning,” she explained.It may explain why the Irish team played with such joy and without fear throughout the tournament.They squad’s unofficial anthem is the Lighthouse Family’s High which closed the homecoming. Arm in arm and hand in hand they swayed to the music and the crowd swayed along with them.What highs can surpass this? “We’ll get to the Olympics,” said coach Graham Shaw.To that end, the extra money will come in handy. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport stressed\u0026nbspthe €1.5 million was not drawn from pre-existing commitments but instead was part of a larger “windfall” of money given to the department that will be allocated to other areas under Mr Ross’s remit.\u0026nbspA spokesman said the €1.5 million would go towards high performance sports in preparation for the 2020 Olympics, but the exact proportion that will be given to women’s hockey has yet to be decided.However, as Shaw pointed out, the disparity of resources remains massive. He revealed that one of the other teams in the World Cup had a budget of €17 million. That’s what this Irish team continues to be up against."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3588189.1533621411!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cookie %C3%A1r l%C3%A1 gerry adams to publish book of recipes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerry Adams: “The British never fed us . . . But as intrepid republicans and being blessed by one or two great cooks these are the recipes that sustained the Irish negotiating team.” Photograph: Alan BetsonSinn Féin’s Gerry Adams says he is planning to publish a cookery book, with ingredients including “some of the best-kept secrets of the Irish peace process”.The former Sinn Féin president said he intended to reveal the recipes which sustained republicans through nights and years of talks.Speaking at a Féile an Phobail event in west Belfast on Monday night, the Louth TD disclosed the tome, to be printed by Sinn Féin before Christmas, is to be called The Negotiators’ Cook Book.“The British never fed us. They never had any food. But as intrepid republicans and being blessed by one or two great cooks these are the recipes that sustained the Irish negotiating team.“It contains some of the best-kept secrets of the Irish peace process.”The author of some 15 books, including memoirs and political and historical works, will also unveil a new book of short stories next year – which has been five years in the making, he said.In his first solo appearance in the festival, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary, Mr Adams said he preferred writing fiction to non-fiction.It was an almost entirely non-controversial evening – Mr Adams describing the encounter as “the nicest interview I’ve ever had” – but he did urge people against identifying as “Northern Irish” in the next census.He recalled being puzzled as a teenager when an official form asked him to state whether he was British or Irish.“I was surprised that a form would ask such a question. There’s a census coming up and please don’t let anyone put ‘Northern Irish’. Some people are on a little journey and we should assist them in that journey at this time.”Mr Adams told the audience that as a boy he devoured the works of Enid Blyton, Biggles, Roy of the Rovers, the Just William series – all staples of British literary history – and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.Quizzed by Irish News columnist Jude Collins, Mr Adams said for many years republicans had not kept proper records of their negotiations with the British.“There would be meetings and no record of the meetings,” he said.A regular tweeter and blogger – whose current book Never Give Up collects Andersonstown News columns – he also described going into the National Library in Dublin for research. He added: “If you do want to write fiction, you need time for day-dreaming”.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin said on Monday evening that its Northern Ireland leader, Michelle O’Neill, had broken her leg. The former Stormont minister for health “underwent a procedure and is recovering well”, the party said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3587837.1533567888!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern ireland on verge of new world record for no government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tArlene Foster: The DUP leader has said Northern Ireland can’t continue in a “decision-making limbo” but there seems to be no  immediate prospect of a political breakthrough, Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire“It can’t go on like this,” a Stormont civil servant moaned to The . The public just don’t seem to have got the fact that Northern Ireland is close to governmental paralysis, he lamented.Very soon Northern Ireland should achieve a new world record. Since the Assembly election of March 2nd last year there have been no ministers running departments at Stormont – and even then their powers were limited due to the political crash of January 2017.That’s well over 500 days and about 30 days shy of the 541 days Belgium was without an elected government from 2010 – an accomplishment (if that’s the word?) that got it into the Guinness World Records book.Beating Belgium’s record would offer no consolation given the current economic and political inertia, the civil servant was sure, but it might help to make a point to a fairly apathetic Northern public.The lack of a Northern Executive wasn’t just some minor lacuna in democratic politics, he added, it was affecting every area of society and holding up many hundreds of millions of pounds in investment and the creation of thousands of jobs.He bemoaned the fact that economic growth had virtually flat-lined at around one per cent in Northern Ireland, which had “probably the lowest growth of all UK regions”, while growth south of the Border was expected to be about 4.5 per cent.And all because the DUP and Sinn Féin can’t work out a deal on the Irish language. There are other matters too but that is the main one.The civil servant pouring out his heart was reflecting comments that the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, David Sterling, already has stated: “I don’t think this situation would have been tolerated anywhere else in these islands.”To escape from that forbidding place would require British government direct-rule ministers running Northern Ireland in the continuing absence of an executive.But that is anathema to nationalists. Moreover, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and, perhaps less enthusiastically, the British government believe there is still some chance that come the late autumn that the DUP and Sinn Féin might be able to get politics moving again.It must be said that judging by the DUP and Sinn Féin lukewarm reaction to Varadkar’s hope of October talks that there is little expectation that such negotiations would lead to a speedy return of Stormont – particularly with a Southern presidential election, Brexit, the Renewable Heat Incentive inquiry and a possible North Antrim by-election getting in the way.The gloomy civil servant obviously is correct: key executive decisions are not being made and without ministers in place and without a return to direct rule then the stasis must continue. Matters were made worse last week when it was confirmed that the Northern Ireland Civil Service does not plan to appeal to the Court of Appeal ruling banning the creation of a £240 million incinerator at Mallusk in Co Antrim.The key part of the judgment stated: “Any decision which as a matter of convention or otherwise would normally go before the minister for approval lies beyond the competence of a senior civil servant in the absence of a minister.”As far as civil servants were concerned this was a stark and unequivocal decree that meant any officials thinking and acting for themselves on a huge range of departmental issues could end up facing legal challenges if they acted in an executive capacity.Outlining all of the stalled works would take thousands of words but it’s useful to outline some major areas where government is gridlocked in Northern Ireland.The most emotionally charged issue is how the survivors of historical institutional abuse haven’t received a penny in compensation. The survivors must have thought some sort of dark ironical force was at work when in January last year the Historical Institutional Abuse inquiry led by retired High Court judge Sir Anthony Hart reported found evidence of sexual, physical and emotional abuse, neglect and unacceptable practices across the 22 Catholic, Protestant and state-run homes and institutions that it investigated.He called for an apology, a memorial, support services, and a redress system where an estimated 500 victims and survivors would receive compensation payments ranging from a minimum of £7,500 up to a maximum of £100,000 depending on the level of abuse. Unfortunately, that report coincided with the late Martin McGuinness walking himself and Sinn Féin out of the Executive and effectively collapsing Stormont.Judge Hart has pleaded for action to be taken to assist the survivors while Margaret McGuckin and her colleagues in Savia – Survivors and Victims of Institutional Abuse – have fought and lobbied in vain to that end. Without ministers there has been no movement.McGuckin says that at least 12 of the victims died since January last year.“Our people are in a raw and emotional state,” she said. “They have lost their trust. All they get are words but no action.”There also are cross-Border implications over the deadlock. In January the North’s Department of Infrastructure granted full planning permission for the £200 million 138 kilometre North-South electricity interconnector running from Meath to Tyrone.But again, with some landowners objecting to the connector, official sources in Northern Ireland were clear that no Northern Ireland civil servant could push forward significantly with the project.Other major infrastructural works also are on hold. They include the £77.5 million refurbishment of Casement Park GAA ground in west Belfast. In the absence of any development it’s a site that looks very sad and neglected at the moment.Another project offering hundreds of jobs and major investment is the planned new office block, cruiser terminal and small power station at Belfast Harbour. That was estimated to involve about £500,000 worth of investment but is tied up because the harbour commissioners can’t get planning permission.The also are proposals for a £160 million transport hub in the Glengall Street area of central Belfast but again the want of ministers is preventing progress on the project.The Institute of Directors in the North has estimated that more than £1 billion of infrastructural projects are threatened due to the political impasse.On a recent visit to the North the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond sensed a frustration that if the logjam were not broken that it “would exact a toll on inward investment and confidence by foreign firms who are investing here”.It was recently announced that Westminster was ending the 1 per cent pay rise limit for public servants in Britain with increases on offer of up to 3 per cent. No Northern Executive again means that senior civil servants hardly will be in a position to offer such rises to nurses, teachers and police officers in Northern Ireland which apart from the inequity of the position is sure to anger public sector unions and their members.Civil servants also are unlikely to tackle big health and education issues that have been pending on the missing ministers’ desks. For instance there are long-standing proposals to rationalise the schools systems through closures and mergers. But again what civil servant would move on such volatile plans?There also were plans to reshape stroke services in Northern Ireland, to “reconfigure” hospital emergency departments and to reform adult social care policy. But, said one official source, “these are highly emotive and politically charged and civil servants can’t make those decisions”.The sclerotic nature of government crosses all departments. In agriculture for instance there has been a public consultation on eradicating bovine TB but there is no minister to sign off on a new strategy.There are scores of public appointments to numerous boards to be made, but again with no ministers there can be no appointments. The North’s Policing Board which holds the PSNI to account has no legal authority because there is no minister of justice.This has practical implications because, for instance, it is the job of the board to replace former deputy PSNI chief constable Drew Harris who is taking over as Garda Commissioner.The Northern Secretary Karen Bradley has instructed her officials to prepare legislation that would allow Westminster direct rule ministers reconstitute the Policing Board and permit “crucial appointments” to leading public bodies such as the Northern Ireland Judicial Appointments Commission and the Probation Board for Northern Ireland.But she is highly reluctant to go beyond such measures in terms of direct rule, still hoping that somehow – and despite all the negative indicators – that the DUP and Sinn Féin will strike a deal to restore the Northern Executive and bring back real government to Northern Ireland.If however the paralysis runs into next year – and there is no real sense of political energy or public outcry against the stalemate – then it may be very difficult for Bradley and the British government to avoid some form of return to British ministers taking decisions that should be taken by Northern Ireland ministers.Certainly that seemed to be the view of the doleful civil servant mentioned earlier. He concluded:, “We are incredibly frustrated as a civil service because we care about this place, we are part of it, our families are here and it is very frustrating for all of us. We can see decay and stagnation in many of our public services. It can’t go on like this.”Full results and coverage of the fallout of the Stormont Assembly election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3588187.1533589984!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"senior officials to be summoned to northern ireland forum","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tParliament Buildings at Stormont. MLAs have agreed to form the Regional-Local Government Forum along with representatives from all councils in the province. Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGetty ImagesThe growing power vacuum in Northern Ireland is to be addressed by a new body set up despite the ongoing devolution deadlock at Stormont.Senior civil servants including permanent secretaries are to be summoned to the Regional-Local Government Forum which is to hold its first formal meeting later this month.MLAs have agreed to form the organisation along with representatives from all councils in the province, although it has no powers.It was an initiative by the councils’ umbrella body, the Northern Ireland Local Government Association (NILGA) and replaces the so-called Political Panel which brought Ministers regularly into contact with councillors but which folded when the Assembly and Executive collapsed more than 18 months ago.Decision-making in the absence of Ministers has been thrown into disarray following a High Court ruling that the permanent secretary of the Department of Infrastructure, Peter May, did not have the authority to give the green light to a controversial waste incinerator plant in Co Antrim.Since the verdict in May, senior civil servants have tended to err on the side of caution, with former first minister Arlene Foster, whose DUP party is propping up the Conservative government in London, calling on Secretary of State Karen Bradley to push ahead with the introduction of direct rule.The forum will provide an opportunity for MLAs including former ministers to quiz senior civil servants on the paralysis, which is affecting funding in key areas including education and health.Former NILGA president Arnold Hatch said: “We will be trying to find out exactly what the position is in relation to civil servants taking decisions across the board.“It seems they can do even less than they previously thought they could do. Yet the Government is doing nothing about it.“Now that there are no local Ministers NILGA insisted that the forum should be able to call permanent secretaries and other senior civil servants who would normally be accountable to Assembly committees.“It doesn’t have any powers but the forum should be able to make it clear to the Secretary of State that this is an issue which cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.”The forum is also likely to add to pressure on the UK Government to consider deferring increased powers to the province’s 11 councils in the continuing gap left by the limbo around the Assembly.The forum has the backing of both the DUP and Sinn Féin, as well as the other three main parties – the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance. The Green Party, which has two MLAs, has already backed an enhanced role for the councils, which amalgamated from the previous 26 local authorities five years ago.Three months ago an independent report commissioned by NILGA concluded councils could have direct responsibility for services and undertake scrutiny of matters that are at present supposed to be the direct responsibility of the Executive.Full results and coverage of the fallout of the Stormont Assembly election"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.German couple convicted over rape after selling young son for sex on dark web\u0026#39Risk taking\u0026#39 men are ten times more likely to die while swimming in the sea, RNLI warnsMargaret Hodge accuses Labour of \u0026#39cynical attempt to save face\u0026#39 in anti-Semitism rowSearch for survivors on Indonesian island of Lombok as earthquake death toll expected to riseBeyonce\u0026#39s \u0026#39gift of twins righted wrong of ancestors\u0026#39 - a slave owner who married a slaveCalifornia wildfires now largest in state historyIran\u0026#39s Hassan Rouhani hits out at US sanctions as \u0026#39psychological warfare\u0026#39Replacing blackboards with interactive whiteboards was a waste of money, Education Secretary saysLeonard Bernstein\u0026#39s daughter questions \u0026#39political correctness\u0026#39 of West Side Story castingWomen more likely to survive heart attack if treated by female doctors Universities’ main purpose is no longer learning, minister says as he calls for mental health focusDeath of the phrase book and rise of smartphone translation apps leads to holiday faux pas, British Council sayThink tank says it\u0026#39s \u0026#39hard to believe\u0026#39 ministers are talking about a no-deal BrexitRick Gates testifies he committed crimes with Trump\u0026#39s former campaign manager Paul ManafortCar thief killed retired nurse in 147mph hit-and-run when he crashed stolen Mercedes on 60mph roadBBC Panorama accidentally revealed young boy\u0026#39s name during investigation into abuse in jailsBarry Chuckle was fighting secret bone cancer battle when he died, brother revealsEleven children in US rescued from \u0026#39extremists\u0026#39 at \u0026#39filthy\u0026#39 hideoutWarmer than average autumn expected after UK summer heatwave Comment: Building on the green belt won\u0026#39t solve the affordable housing crisis – let\u0026#39s abolish stamp duty insteadWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Their choice has to be somewhere that has the people they need, and can be counted on to attract themClick to followThe Independent OnlineBrexit means London\u0027s financial star is falling. Which of its rivals is best placed to rise?“I mean Dusseldorf? Why on earth would I want to move to Dusseldorf?”This was the appalled reaction of a banker friend of mine in reaction to the prospect of being relocated to the German city as a result of the Conservative Party’s lunatic hard Brexit.In case you hadn’t noticed, the latter is delivering a gut punch to a part of the British economy that exported a world-leading £77bn of services, and contributed £72.1bn in tax to the UK exchequer in 2017.In the absence of a miracle, London’s world-leading financial centre is set to emerge much diminished from what has been going on, with banks and other financial institutions actively setting up subsidiaries in EU countries so they can continue to do business in the event of the UK tipping over a cliff. They will be ready even if the country is not.But which of the rivals vying for London’s business will emerge as the winner?And how will its workers feel about relocation there? That’s something banks have to take into account, dealing as they are with highly qualified, and mobile, personnel.My banker friend’s dismay at the prospect of his particular business unit relocating to Dusseldorf wasn’t entirely fair.Mercer, a consultant, regularly looks at the quality of life offered by the world’s cities. It rated the capital of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as one of the 10 best places to live in the world, and the fourth best in Europe. Dusseldorf has held that exalted status for more than a decade, too.It’s clean, civilised, has a fine academy of arts, and is the birthplace of the mighty Kraftwerk, the pioneering electronic music band.While it doesn’t merit a place in ZYen’s global financial centre index, there is a respectable enough financial services industry there, the employees of which have much to be thankful for.But, of course, it isn’t London.The capital of Britain limps in at a dismal 41st when it comes to the annual quality of life rankings compiled by Mercer, a consultancy firm. However, it is one of only a handful of cosmopolitan, truly global cities. It might have its warts, it occasionally drives those of us that live here up the wall, but many of its residents would be loath\u0026nbspto live anywhere else. After all, as the saying goes, “If you’re tired of London, you’re tired of life.”Is that something that you could say about Frankfurt, or Hamburg, or Luxembourg? Or even Dusseldorf?Nonetheless, a number of those working in financial services are having to resign themselves to the prospect of relocating to one or other of them.The exodus the Leave campaign said wouldn’t happen is under way. The numbers have been relatively small to date. But they are expected to rise rapidly over the coming months, especially if the UK crashes out without a deal, as seems increasingly likely.The trouble is, all of London’s rivals come with significant drawbacks.The ZYen index has only one other EU financial centre in its top 20. That would be Frankfurt, which still fell nine places in the latest report. Although its overall points rating ticked up a bit, others overtook it.However, it looks as if Frankfurt and its rivals are set to climb over the coming years, if only because of the one big advantage they all have over London: their host countries are governed by more or less sensible people.The German city has long fancied itself as London’s chief European rival.However, it should be noted that, according to the TheCityUK, Britain’s capital employs nearly 800,000 people in its financial centre, more than actually live within Frankfurt’s administrative boundaries, and about a third of the population of the urban area as a whole.Nonetheless, Frankfurt has been on a charge. Its most recent victory came courtesy of Deutsche Bank, which shifted a large part of its euro clearing activity to the city. The gesture was a largely symbolic one (it was done with the flip of a switch), but it was nonetheless seen as a victory for a campaign by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Borse to grab a larger slice of what is a lucrative market.One of the biggest knocks on Frankfurt is that it has something of a reputational issue.When City types declare that they’re going to visit the home of both the European Central Bank and Germany’s Bundesbank, it’s not uncommon for them to get an “oh dear, poor you” in response.\u0026nbsp“I know,” goes the typical reply, “but I’ll be back before the weekend.”The city is aware of the issue.“Frankfurt is an amazing city to live in (and visit), especially for young, successful professionals,” gushed an email from Frankfurt Main Finance, which serves as the voice of its financial centre in a similar way\u0026nbspto the TheCityUK for London.It continued: “However, the city is often overlooked by journalists and has a reputation for being provincial. This is something we would like to change.”On offer was an opportunity to sample the World Club Dome weekend, billed as “the world’s biggest club event with an international DJ line-up” and boasting 700,000 square metres of dance floors. Yah boo sucks to anyone who calls us provincial!There’s also a museum devoted to electronic music (something Germany does extremely well – it’s not just Kraftwerk) and more besides.Still, a recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers into the UK’s financial and professional services industries looked at London’s main rivals couldn’t resist noting that while Frankfurt compares favourably to the UK capital in terms of its low crime and enviably high quality of life, it “has less cultural appeal than London or Paris”.The same report went on to note that: “German authorities and regulators are seen as predictable, but not particularly flexible or innovation-friendly. There are restrictive labour laws and high taxes.”One problem that Frankfurt doesn’t have: English is the language of international finance and Germany’s great financial institutions have no problem with using it (if you’re English and feeling embarrassed about that now you wouldn’t be alone).Just a tick below Frankfurt, and scoring a top 20 rating in the Mercer quality of life index (18th position globally), is Luxembourg, the tiny, landlocked Grand Duchy, sandwiched between Belgium, Germany and Austria. What we’re actually talking about here, however, is the capital, which also goes by the name of Luxembourg.The place has long enjoyed a reputation for low taxes, to the extent that that European Commission has been investigating some of the deals struck with internet companies such as Amazon in recent years.When it comes to financial services, it has established a reputation as a leading centre for asset management, hosting the second largest investment fund market globally, together with one of Europe’s largest private banking markets.The place has also benefited from longstanding social and political stability, which has supported its development as an international financial hub.PwC praises “its modern and continuously updated legal and regulatory framework”. They have “supported the development of specific sectors”, for example, alternative investment funds, venture capital funds and international pension funds.It also hails the “regular and close collaboration between the government, regulators and private sector, which has contributed to its success”.The tax and regulatory systems are also seen as ultra stable. On the flipside, it might not be seen as the most exciting place to live, and its population is less than that of Ipswich. So it doesn’t have the sort of “cluster effect” that makes it relatively easy for big institutions to get the qualified staff they need in the really large financial centres.Like London, Paris is a world city. You couldn’t imagine anyone saying “oh God, not there” at the prospect of being relocated to the city of lights even if Mercer has it in only 39th position as regards the qualify of life on offer there (two spots above the UK capital).The disadvantage with the place was summed up by one financial services manager of my acquaintance: “It’s the sort of place to take your lover for a romantic weekend, but not the sort of place you’d go to set up a business.”A lot of people in City circles have talked only half-jokingly of worrying whether any work would get done if they relocated there.Just like the perception of Frankfurt being terminally dull, that’s probably an exaggeration and not entirely fair.Paris has an entirely legitimate financial centre that has enjoyed some success.But it has likely factored into bosses’ thinking all the same.According to PwC’s assessment, the place has traditionally been focussed on domestic banking, but “it is also developing a leading position in investment management and corporate bond issuance within Europe”.It notes that France’s regulatory authorities are attempting to become more responsive, “but are not perceived to be as market or innovation-friendly as some other regulators”. Another criticism is the “difficulty of interaction with the tax authorities”, along with “high corporate and personal tax rates, restrictive labour laws and limited use of English”. The latter is not a problem for Dublin or Frankfurt, or even Hamburg.France is trying to work on some of these, up to and including offering conditional tax incentives to draw people in.Not an option that has been much discussed, Hamburg is actually where Germany’s first exchange and its first privately owned financial institution (Berenberg Bank) were founded. Today it boasts a stock exchange, a banking sector that employs 25,000 people, Germany’s third largest insurance centre and a sizeable fintech hub. As far as pros and cons go, they’re similar to Frankfurt’s, although as the main centre the latter would be the first choice of many.As a place to live it ranks 19th in Mercer’s rankings, in which German cities do very well as a rule. It’s also the home of FC St Pauli, the cult football club famed for the left-leaning character of its supporters. A trip there is probably not the sort of ersion that would find favour with bankers on the lookout for something to do of a weekend.Dublin has a lot going for it, both as a place to live and to do business. It boasts the sort of low tax regime judged to be “business friendly”,\u0026nbsp for which read “low” (and how), not to mention its favourable rates of personal taxation for higher earners.It’s a lot smaller than London, or Paris, but the City has plenty of attractions all the same. You aren’t likely to hear many complaints from people asked to spend a few days away there.In terms of “quality of life”, it’s in the same ball park as London and Paris, at number 34.The traffic, in particular, can be murder and is forecast to rise quite rapidly over the coming years. Meanwhile, the  recently complained that the City’s once legendary nightlife is “disintegrating”.PwC’s report praises its strong reputation in back office fund management operations, and insurance, but criticises its less developed capital markets (stock exchanges and the like). The local financial sector is large relative to the economy but PwC says that the financial centre has “less breadth” than its rivals. “This is reflected in the current focus and capabilities of the regulator.”There may also be a perception that it is some way away from the centre of the European action due to its geographic position.Its strong technology sector is seen as a big advantage, and the government there has cannily sought to make the nation “Brexit-ready”. There is also a tax relief programme to support foreign companies in relocating staff.The investment fund set up by arch Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg and his old Etonian chums can certainly testify to the attractions of the place, having set up an\u0026nbspoffice there and started launching product out of it. Go Dublin!\u0026nbspBut who’s going to be the biggest winner out of this lot?Drum roll please: It is of course, New York.Business news: in picturesIconic British car maker Jaguar Land Rover warned on July 5, 2018 that a bad Brexit deal could jeopardise planned investment of more than $100 billion, upping corporate pressure as the government heads into crucial talks.Spotify traded publically for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

Or is he Ed Sheeran? Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

LondonIn the UK, hosepipe bans have been announced, hedgehogs and frogs have been left dying of hunger and thirst, and grass has been scorched yellow during what may yet still be the hottest summer ever.Already July’s average maximum temperature, at 22.5C, was hotter than the same month in the scorching summer of 1976, which recorded an average of 21.6C.And amid news that there are at least two more days of the soaring heat, Public Health England maintained its advice to stay hydrated, keep out the sun where possible between 11am and 2pm, and cover up when outside.But from Wednesday evening onwards Ms Diamond said Britons could expect climes in the UK to cool.“There will be a cool front coming eastwards across the country which will bring cooler and fresher temperatures,” she revealed. “The south and east will still be warmer than average for this time of year but even they will be cooling off. We can expect the odd rumble of thunder.”The north and west especially could expect some showers, she added – but with temperatures then potentially climbing for the weekend across the whole country once more.“A low level pressure system will bring spells of rain before things become brighter and warmer again by Saturday afternoon,” she said.Historic sites across UK exposed by heatwaveCrop marks show of the old garden at Gawthorpe Hall, LancashireGarden at Gawthorpe Hall, Lancashire which was taken out in the 1940\u0027s but can now be seen again through the parched grassRemnants of WWII Air raid shelters on Jesus Green in Cambridge show up in the parched grassOld crop marks in Norfolk show upInfo showing how crop marks are madeOld parts of RAF Lasham\u0027s airfield show up in the parched grass in HampshireCrop marks show in Tregaron, WalesRemnants of Caistor Roman town in NorfolkPenllwyn Roman fort in Ceregigion, WalesCrop marks show in Tregaron, WalesOld parts of RAF Lasham\u0027s airfield Old crop marks in Norfolk Cross Oak hill fort in Talybont, Wales Crop marks show of the old garden at Gawthorpe Hall, LancashireGarden at Gawthorpe Hall, Lancashire which was taken out in the 1940\u0027s but can now be seen again through the parched grassRemnants of WWII Air raid shelters on Jesus Green in Cambridge show up in the parched grassOld crop marks in Norfolk show upInfo showing how crop marks are madeOld parts of RAF Lasham\u0027s airfield show up in the parched grass in HampshireCrop marks show in Tregaron, WalesRemnants of Caistor Roman town in NorfolkPenllwyn Roman fort in Ceregigion, WalesCrop marks show in Tregaron, WalesOld parts of RAF Lasham\u0027s airfield Old crop marks in Norfolk Cross Oak hill fort in Talybont, Wales And there is more good news for sun lovers too: we could be in for an Indian summer, it seems.The long range forecast suggests there will be more hot spells until the end of August, with above average temperatures lasting all the way into the middle of autumn.“The three-month outlook says there is a probability of warmer and drier than average conditions as we move into September and October,” said Ms Diamond.Nonetheless, temperatures will need to climb significantly if they are to come close to England’s current record of 38.5C, which was reached in Faversham, Kent, in August 2003.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/22/19/dollareuropound.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/22/19/dollareuropound.jpg","title":"eu no deal brexit uk european commission theresa may macron france","story":"Created with Sketch.Brussels hits back at allegations of ‘intransigence’\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspas No 10 declines to say if any progress was made in Theresa May’s talks with Emmanuel MacronClick to followIndy PoliticsEU won\u0027t be to blame if UK crashes out with a no-deal Brexit, says European CommissionBrussels has hit back at Theresa May’s government, insisting it will not be to blame if the UK crashes out of the EU without an agreement.Negotiators are working “day and night, 247, for a deal”, the European Commission said – rejecting Liam Fox’s allegation that its “intransigence” was making a no-deal Brexit odds-on.The comment came as No 10 declined to say whether any progress had been made in the prime minister’s Friday night talks with the French president, beyond describing it as “a good meeting”.Ms May’s spokesperson\u0026nbsplisted several key EU figures he claimed had given a “positive response” to aspects of her Brexit plan\u0026nbsp– but,\u0026nbspstrikingly,\u0026nbspdid not mention Emmanuel Macron.At the weekend, Dr Fox, the trade secretary, put the odds of the talks failing at “60-40”, saying: “I think the intransigence of the commission is pushing us towards no deal.”And David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, also ramped up the pressure, warning the EU will be making a “massive miscalculation” if it believed the UK was bluffing about walking away.But a commission spokesperson\u0026nbspdefended its approach, saying: “We are working constructively, day and night, to reach a deal with the United Kingdom and I think this is also reflected in the fact that the next negotiation round is scheduled for 16 and 17 August.People\u0027s Vote march -

Some have already agreed to do so.Each CLP is allowed to propose one motion for discussion at conference, with those receiving the most support from delegates at the gathering likely to be put to a vote. The window for submitting motions opened today.The motion could become party policy if passed, but the Labour leadership is\u0026nbsplikely to strongly resist attempts to force it to change tack.Last year, grassroots attempts to have Brexit debated by delegates at\u0026nbspparty conference\u0026nbspwere seen off by Mr Corbyn’s team and trade union Unite, who\u0026nbspfeared they could force a change in party policy.The latest campaign was endorsed by a number of prominent Labour figures.Manuel\u0026nbspCortes,\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of the\u0026nbspTSSA\u0026nbsptrade union, said:\u0026nbsp“Brexit is a Tory con trick for the benefit of the richest one per cent.

I voted ‘out’ in 1975 and I have fought the advance of neo-liberal orthodoxy for decades. But Brexit\u0026nbspisn’t just about Britain’s membership of the EU. Its right wing proponents are the British franchise of a global movement, stretching from Trump in America to\u0026nbspOrban\u0026nbspin Hungary,\u0026nbspSalvini\u0026nbspin Italy and Marine Le Pen in France. \u0026nbsp“Its effects will be to bolster these far-right and neo-fascist movements internationally, and domestically to further deregulate the economy and attack working class people. That’s why I’ll be backing a People’s Vote at this year’s Labour conference.”The move to have the issue\u0026nbspdebated at Labour conference is likely to raise pressure on Mr Corbyn to soften his Brexit stance. A number of senior Labour figures, including shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, have suggested the party could join calls for a\u0026nbspPeople’s Vote. But the Labour leader has insisted: “It’s not our policy to have a second referendum, it’s out policy to respect the result of the referendum.”It\u0026nbspcomes amid\u0026nbspsigns of growing support for a fresh referendum\u0026nbspamong left-wing supporters of Mr Corbyn. The influential Momentum campaign group\u0026nbspis set to vote on a motion calling for a People’s Vote after a\u0026nbsppetition started by a member in the London borough of Tower Hamlets received\u0026nbspthe 4,000 signatures needed to trigger a ballot of all\u0026nbspMomentum members.\u0026nbspIf passed, it\u0026nbspwould put Momentum\u0026nbspat odds with Mr Corbyn, who the organisation\u0026nbspwas founded to support.\u0026nbspRees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011The Labour for a People’s Vote motion says the Brexit strategy\u0026nbspbeing pursued by Theresa May “is a threat to jobs, freedom of movement, peace in Northern Ireland, and the future of the NHS and public services”.It continues: “Tory Brexit will wreck the British economy, will commit us to a series of long-term trade deals which will enforce American-style deregulation, and will undermine the rights, freedoms and protections currently enshrined in EU law. All of this will bind the hands of a future Labour government, and will make it far harder for us to deliver on our promises.”It says Labour must “oppose any Brexit deal that does not satisfy Labour’s six\u0026nbsptests” and instead “call for an immediate general election, and make a manifesto commitment to call a public vote on the Brexit deal with an option to remain in the EU if the public rejects it”.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteMore than 500,000 back The Independent’s Final Say on Brexit campaignAs a Momentum member, this is why I back a Final SayNational Union of Students backs The Independent’s Final Say campaign If the party “cannot get a general election”, the motion says it should “campaign for a public vote on the deal with an option to remain in the EU and following a defeat for the government,\u0026nbspcall for an immediate general election”.\u0026nbspThe launch of the campaign\u0026nbspcoincides with\u0026nbspa nationwide “Left Against Brexit” tour to encourage left-wing activists to speak out against Brexit. Organised by the cross-party Another Europe is Possible group, events have been held in a number of major cities and many more are planned for the coming weeks.\u0026nbspMarina\u0026nbspPrentoulis, a spokesperson for Another Europe is Possible, said: “Time is up on the Brexit process, and the only version of Brexit we are going to get is a Tory one. If Labour comes to power before exit day, we will be faced with a choice between no deal and an off-the-shelf Norway-style deal – a choice between economic catastrophe and a becoming a rule taker with no say in the making of EU rules. No one voted for this, and implementing it\u0026nbspisn’t the democratic option.“Democracy means giving the people the right to determine their own future, with a referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal with an option to stay in the EU if it is rejected.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereLabour for a People\u0027s VoteEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/12/09/palinthumbs.jpg  width= 816  height= 556  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/12/09/palinthumbs.jpg","title":"who is america sarah palin guests interviews politicians showtime","story":"Created with Sketch.She may have fessed up for to an interview that didn\u0027t even make the cutClick to followThe Independent CultureSarah Palin may not appear on Who is America?: \u0027Several people have thrown themselves in front of buses that may not be heading their way\u0027A Showtime boss has suggested that several politicians and people of note\u0027s attempts to get out in front of their hoax interviews with Sacha Baron Cohen\u0027s Who is America? characters may have been for nothing as they didn\u0027t all make the cut.Four episodes have aired at the time of time writing and three remain, with no sign of Sarah Palin yet, who previously admitted she had been fooled by Baron Cohen.“All I can say about that is that there are several people who have thrown themselves in front of buses that may not be heading their way,”\u0026nbsp Showtime president of programming Gary Levine told reporters about the status of the Palin interview at a Television Critics\u0027 Association panel (via Deadline).He added that Baron Cohen is always refining the show and has a very high bar.

This decision was made by the committee, who were fully alive to the local opposition.There would seem to be no merit in seeking to revoke the permission granted by the committee in such circumstances in the absence of any new material considerations having come to light.

Negotiators from both sides will resume talks after a brief summer sabbatical on August 16.It remains \u0026ldquohighly unlikely that the agreement will be completed in the next round of negotiations, according to an EU official. So, Mrs May now has a number of strategies she can rely on in order to avoid the no deal scenario.Brexit news: Theresa May can adopt a number of tactics to ensure a deal is reached (Image: )Article 50 extensionThe most undesirable method, on either side of the Channel, for avoiding a no deal but one that remains on the table after Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz hinted that an extension could be used to avoid a hard Brexit.At a Vienna press conference the young leader was questioned about the final stages of the negotiations. He told reporters in Vienna he \u0026ldquowould be in favour of pursing negotiations rather than a hard Brexit if no agreement is found in time to avoid a hard border in Ireland.He added: \u0026ldquoOur goal is we reach an agreement with the UK but if that\u0026rsquos not possible we have to avoid a hard Brexit.\u0026ldquoOur goal is clear. If not, it\u0026rsquos good to enough negotiations. We will see.As the current holder of the EU\u0026rsquos rotating presidency, it is down to Austria to recommend to member states the possible course of action. All 28 member states would also have to back the extension.However, Brussels insiders believe the move could create a wave of populist revolt across the Continent.Anti-EU candidates at the next European parliamentary elections in May 2019 would have the ability to campaign on a ticket claiming Britain had voted to leave but wasn\u0026rsquot allowed, according to one senior official.\u0026ldquoDoes Brussels really want a parliament full of Nigel Farages? they asked.

If only we had a leader, not an appeaser.If I have learned one thing from nearly 20 years in Brussels, it is that the bully boys of the EU Commission only respect one thing - brute force.The truth of it is, the protectionist EU has now been forced by Trump into taking an approach that is more towards free trade and fair trade.Theresa May laughed with Angela Merkel after meeting the German chancellor only hours after Brexit chaos resignations                    REUTERS1 of 15Theresa May has met Angela Merkel only hours after the Cabinet\u0027s Brexit turmoilWalk awayBritain would be able to secure a \u0026ldquo\u0026pound80bn Brexit victory if it was to walk away without a deal and trade with the EU on WTO terms instead, according to evidence from leading economists which shows that the best deal for the UK could be a World Trade Deal with no trade deal with the EU.The UK gets to keep its \u0026pound39 billion orce bill and deregulation and controlling immigration could boost Treasury coffers by \u0026pound80 billion a year, according to Economists for Free Trade led by Professor Patrick Minford.The organisation also revealed how countries on WTO terms do three times better in trade that member states of the EU locked in Brussels red tape.Another paper by Professor Minford, an advisor to Margaret Thatcher, and economist Yongdeng Xu shows that \u0026ldquoa breakdown of talks would be positive for the UK to the tune of a one-off gain of \u0026pound38 billion on the EU budget, plus \u0026pound180 billion from bringing forward the non-budgetary Brexit gains, plus \u0026pound433 billion from EU tariff revenue, some \u0026pound651 billion in all.They also note: \u0026ldquoFor the EU it would mean a one-off loss of \u0026pound38 billion in financial settlement, plus another one-off loss of \u0026pound36 billion in terms of trade gain, plus the \u0026pound433 billion from paying the UK its tariff revenue.Wait it outThe threat of no deal has become one of the strongest weapons in both the EU and UK\u0026rsquos Brexit negotiation arsenal.According to predictions from either side, failing to conclude a withdrawal deal could be catastrophic.New Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt pointed out the potential damage to the Continent when on a diplomatic mission to as part of Mrs May\u0026rsquos bid to win a number of concessions from European heads of state.Mr Hunt said: \u0026ldquoThe probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European commission, who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink.\u0026ldquoFrance and Germany have to send a strong signal to the commission that we need to negotiate a pragmatic and sensible outcome that protects jobs on both sides of the Channel, because for every job lost in the UK, there will be jobs lost in Europe as well if Brexit goes wrong.And, after meeting German counterpart Heiko Maas, Mr Hunt said: Without a real change in approach from the EU negotiators we do now face a real risk of a no deal by accident, and that would be incredibly challenging economically.Britain would find that challenging, but in the end we would find a way not just to survive but to thrive economically. But my real concern is that it would change British public attitudes to Europe for a generation.While one of the riskier tactics, a game of chicken could ultimately decide whether one side profits or not.EU countries\u0027 leaders meet on 28 and 29 June for a summit to discuss migration in general, the installation of asylum-seeker processing centres in northern Africa, and other security- and economy-related topics including Brexit.

Hector is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, though Hector is expected to remain a major hurricane.The centre of the storm will pass about 150 miles south of Hawaii (Image: AccuWeather)Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km).Swells generated by Hector are expected to reach southeast and east facing shores of the Big Island and eastern Maui during the next day, likely becoming large by late Tuesday and Wednesday.Tropical storm force winds are possible across Hawaii County late Tuesday night or Wednesday.Hector is in an area with low vertical wind shear, which has allowed it to intensify into a powerful hurricane.The storm is currently about 890 miles east-southeast of Honolulu (Image: NHC)Most of the forecast guidance is now unanimous, saying the tropical storm will remain south of the rest of the Hawaiian Islands through Thursday.Still, people of Hawaii have been urged to act now to complete preparations before the wind becomes hazardous.The potential impacts include localised rainfall flooding and fierce winds could prompt a few evacuations in Big Island.Porches, awnings, carports, sheds and unanchored mobile homes might be affected by wind damage.People are being warned swimming and boating will be dangerous towards the end of the week as rough seas and strong rip currents will affect eastern and southern-facing coasts.Every year, there are approximately five tropical systems that pass over over the central Pacific basin.

Available only to the elite few who could afford them at first, they were designed purely to enable people to take a call while away from home.Fast forward a couple of decades and we are all glued to our devices, a nation of addicts.We are now so wedded to our smartphones that we check them every 12 minutes.The average Brit spends more than a day a week online, twice as long as ten years ago.This surge in time online is largely down to the rise of smartphones, which are now used by 78 per cent of the population compared with just 17 per cent in 2008.My personal bugbear is people who walk along the street in a slow zig-zag because they are glued to their phone.And there’s nothing worse than someone who interrupts a conversation to take a call or read a text.It surely can’t be a coincidence that, in the same week as this report was released, we hear about five-year-olds starting school unable to speak in sentences — partly, no doubt, down to parents plugging them into a screen rather than talking or reading to them.I’ve got a Blackberry, mainly because I like the keyboard. But I am probably as hooked on it as the next person.It’s an invaluable tool for anyone wanting to work flexibly. But I also do a fair amount of pointless surfing on it.I’m not into all forms of social media, but I am a bit of a news junkie and I’ll confess I also watch the odd funny YouTube film with my kids.Unfortunately, progress in technology has brought the idea that we “should” all be available 24/7.In fact, people are quite indignant if you don’t reply to an email within the hour — even if it’s sent at 4am.Being a conscientious type, the result for me if I’m not careful, is that if I wake up in the night I’ll check my emails and maybe even reply to a few before going back to sleep. Now that can’t be good for the old circadian rhythms.The other problem with everyone being always available and always “on” is that our FOMO — fear of missing out — has increased exponentially.We’re all terrified that if we’re offline for too long we won’t get to . . . what exactly? See photos of someone’s hashtag perfect holibobs with the famalam — and then feel like our life is rubbish by comparison?I use Twitter a bit but I avoid Facebook and Instagram, partly because I don’t want the possibility that the opinions and “likes” of people I don’t know may influence me more than my own values and views.And another problem with the prevalence of tech is that we don’t have any down time.All those previously blank moments — on the bus, waiting for our microwave meal to cook, lying in bed at night — have all become an opportunity to surf, tweet, and message. We are going to burn out if we aren’t careful.I always know when I’m really relaxed because I accidentally go out without my phone.Granted, it generally only happens when I’m on holiday.But now I know how close we are to becoming actual addicts, I feel like we should all build in some time away from our devices.After all, the more time we spend looking at a screen, the less time we spend looking at the world and engaging with other people.So maybe we should all take a moment to leave our phone at home, go for a walk, and switch from “on” to “off”.Isn’t that a liberating thought?I’M sure a fair few people felt a bit guilty reading about the Vogue interview with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie this week.The sisters talk about how hard it is living in the public eye but also the criticism and mockery they face, often attacked for taking too many holidays.Who knows, perhaps some of that criticism is justified.But a lot of the comments they get are about their appearance and clothes – and that is where it crosses a line.No-one chooses the family into which they are born, and they are trying to make the best of the hand they’ve been given.They are trying to build careers and have a personal life while being in the public eye and that can’t be easy.I hope people realise that and give them a break.HAVING spent the past couple of decades getting annoyed at anyone who utters the words “Poor Jennifer Aniston”, this week, for the first time ever, I said them myself.You know why?Because the 49-year-old has been forced to publicly address, again, the tedious topic of why she hasn’t had a baby.She also alluded to something no woman should have to share with anyone they don’t want to, let alone the world – the fact she might be medically unable to procreate.Poor Jen. She can’t just get on with her very successful – and no doubt happy – life without being plagued by speculation.In the same interview she took the chance to spell it out: Just because she split from Justin Theroux doesn’t mean her life is over.She might even be happy to have finally got shot of him.“The misconceptions are ‘Jen can’t keep a man’,” she said. “And ‘Jen refuses to have a baby because she’s selfish and committed to her career.’ Or that I’m sad and heartbroken . . . first, with all due respect, I’m not heartbroken. And second, those are reckless assumptions.“No one knows what’s going on behind closed doors. No one considers how sensitive that might be for my partner and me. They don’t know what I’ve been through medically or emotionally.“There is a pressure on women to be mothers, and if they are not, then they’re deemed damaged goods. Maybe my purpose on this planet isn’t to procreate. Maybe I have other things I’m supposed to do.”So yes. Poor, poor Jen being under the world’s watchful and pitying eye all the time.Just to remind people. Jennifer Aniston is one of the world’s most successful stars.She has a big group of friends and a beautiful home, which she bought herself. She has dogs she adores, she’s funny, busy, and fulfilled.But all of that is worth nothing, of course. She doesn’t have kids.To anyone reading this who thinks women must have children to be fulfilled, please take note: Plenty of women don’t want to get married or have kids.Many other women want kids but can’t have them.And guess what? It’s none of our business.Here’s another way of looking at Jennifer’s life. She is lucky.She gets to please herself and hasn’t had to make any of the sacrifices that many of us make to become mothers.Also, George Clooney didn’t meet Amal until he was 51. Hugh Grant got married this year at 57 (after many failed relationships). Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, and Jude Law, 45, are still single and dating. Has anyone ever said: “Poor George/Hugh/Leonardo/Jude”?Of course they haven’t. So let’s stop saying it about Jennifer, too.I SO related to Carol Vorderman’s delight at being asked for proof of age when she bought some wine at M\u0026ampS recently.When you’re young, being asked to prove your age, as the presenter, above, was is very annoying. But as time goes by it’s one of life’s little victories.Having said that, this hasn’t happened to me in Aldi. Maybe I ought to go to M\u0026ampS!I’M truly appalled by the news that the Home Office “turns a blind eye” to the plight of British teenagers who are being forced to marry abroad, then raped and impregnated – after which the ministerial department actually hands a visa to their husbands.These young British women in question are forced abroad, or told they are going on holiday, but in reality are forced into a marriage and to get pregnant so that they can apply for a UK visa for their “husband”.Officials received dozens of reports last year that women wanted to block visas for men they had been made to marry in countries including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emirates.But in almost half of their cases the visas were approved nonetheless! And experts believe that there are thousands more victims who are too afraid to come forward.The women forced into this situation must be absolutely terrified, not least because their own family is complicit in this abuse.The authorities when granting the visa do not actually speak to the “wife”. There is no whistle-blowing process or opportunity for the women to make a confidential statement. Any statement made is public.Authorities fear that if they block the visa they will be called racists, but this is a safeguarding issue and that fear of causing offence really has to stop.We need to get on top of the problem by working with schools to raise awareness, so girls know how to report it.And we need to work with social workers so they can recognise the family members are the perpetrators of this crime.GOSH, how shocking is the video footage of a woman called Arabella Juniper Torres calling the police to report a woman, who happened to be black, for sheltering in her doorway in Brooklyn, New York, while waiting for her Uber?We are living in the age of the death of the Good Samaritan.I helped someone carry a pushchair downstairs at the Tube last week – as all the burly men walked past, I might add.She was so grateful it made me realise small acts of kindness have all but disappeared. How about this for an idea: let’s all try to be kind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And how did they get so sick that they believe their behaviour is socially acceptable?These women-hating bullies — Liam Holmes, 20, who battered a woman to the ground outside Faces nightclub, and the five smirking thugs who tormented a vulnerable woman but can’t be named because they are under 18 — are not the products of brutal, inner-city gangland.These blights on the face of British manhood are the product of ordinary homes, God help us.They are what our young men look like now.They are not feral kids who never had a chance.They are not the products of deprived lives.The leering bullies posing proudly around their terrified victim in that sun-drenched park are growing up in Bury St Edmunds, a peaceful Suffolk market town with pretty cottages and a lovely cathedral, while Liam Holmes attacked his victim outside a club that was once a fashionable oasis for footballers and pop stars, the Essex answer to New York’s Studio 54.These thugs all have dear old mums who love them to bits.Indeed, the mother of one of the park scum sacks — a woman who must have an IQ lower than her dress size — complained that her son was the one suffering now because the backlash has ruined his 16th birthday.The poor little lamb! What’s the world coming to if you and your mates can’t torture a vulnerable middle-aged woman in the park any more?Personally, I hope the backlash ruins his life.And while we ponder these pitiful excuses for young men, let us spare a thought for their female victims.The 18-year-old woman who was punched to the ground by Liam Holmes has been predictably abused in the sewer of social media, informed “she deserved it” for daring to speak back to a man, and gloatingly told that, “she had a lesson in true equality.Meanwhile the vulnerable 49-year-old woman who was brutalised in the park has spoken with incredible restraint about her experience, which must have been as humiliating as it was frightening.“Considering the respective ages of all parties and that it was five or six young men versus me alone, I remain surprised that they behaved in such a way towards me,” she said.“I would like to hear their reasons, if possible.”Which is so mild-mannered that I find it breaks my bloody heart.It is tempting to blame the surge in violence against women on social media, and brainless morons like the little d**ks in that park taking pictures to show off to their mates. But it can’t all be blamed on social media.I bet Liam Holmes wishes there were no cameras around when he was smashing a woman in the jaw.“He wouldn’t do that for no reason,” protests his mother Cathy, 53. “There was a lot that went on before that people don’t know about.”Sorry, there can never be an excuse, reason or justification for a man or boy to abuse a woman or girl. Not ever.The old taboo about men being violent towards women should still stand.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they say something cutting to you at chucking out time.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they have the insolent cheek to sit on the park bench where you like to hang out with your bad-ass homies in the Bury St Edmunds massive.How hard is it to understand?Men should not be violent towards women.My father, the hardest man I ever met, taught me a real man does not raise his voice to a woman, let alone his hand.But that generation of tough, gentle men has gone and in their place we have pitiful excuses for the male of the species who feel empowered by belittling, beating and abusing women.And what sickens the stomach about the boys in the park is that they all look so very pleased with themselves, as if tormenting a vulnerable woman who, in the words of her stepmother “wouldn’t say boo to a goose” is the high point of their miserable lives.It is a good job their mothers all love them because I can’t imagine any other self-respecting woman ever will.“He’s never had a girlfriend,” someone remarked of woman-bashing lout, Liam Holmes.Yes, it shows. The big close-up Nicole posted on Instagram is absolutely terrifying. What a scary face! The spider, I mean. Not Nicole.HOW sweet life was for Jeremy Corbyn when he was a loopy left-wing backbencher, free to flutter his eyelashes at the IRA, to stand on platforms that compared Israel to Nazi Germany and to bowl up on Iranian TV praising the release of Hamas terrorists who had murdered Jewish children.But now fate has Corbyn as a possible Prime Minister his support of extremism is not such a good look.And no matter how pathetic this Tory Government becomes, no matter how timid, weak and gutless Theresa May looks in the face of Brussels’ bullying, the British people will never choose for Prime Minister a man who considers the child killers in Hamas to be his “brothers”.“In the past, in the pursuit of peace and justice for the Palestinian people, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject,” apologises panicky Corbyn, a man who can feel the keys to 10 Downing Street slipping through his fingers.The past is coming back to haunt Jeremy Corbyn.And it will destroy him.It might also have something to do with the celeb fear of looking like a sweaty idiot with two left feet, while wearing nipple-crushing Lycra on prime-time television.Luckily, Nadiya Bychkova, above, will be there for her second series, the only pro dancer who looks more like a celebrity than any of the celebrities.THOSE who want the UK to remain in the European Union have never made any attempt to persuade the 17.4million who voted to leave to change our minds.They just insult us.Peter Mandelson says Brexiteers “hate other countries and hate foreigners” while Stewart Lee, a pot-bellied Bernard Manning for snowflakes, says: “It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe – c**** did as well. Stupid f****** c****.”Just insults.Which is why Remain lost the referendum. And why they would lose 100 referendums.BAKE Off winner Nadiya Hussain tells Loose Women: “I work in an industry that is heavily dominated by male, middle-class, middle-aged men and there’s no space for a 5ft brown girl, who wears a headscarf.”But you became a national treasure, Nadiya.So self-pity is misplaced.MADONNA turns 60 years old on August 16 and has marked the birthday by laying provocatively on the ground sporting suspenders, lacy bra and a been-to-bed expression in her half-closed eyes.The Material Girl still looks great, of course.Mind you, she does look as though she might need a hand getting back on her feet. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fine. But this leopard is not about to change his spots.Throughout his life he has shown terrible judgment. It is extraordinary how often he picks the wrong side.He is not just a threat to British Jews if he gets into power.He’s a threat to Britain, full stop.BRUSSELS bureaucrats always put their precious project ahead of common sense.It explains their approach to Brexit negotiations.Yet our analysis of what a ‘no deal’ Brexit would mean for French pharmaceutical companies, German car manufacturers and everything in between should focus minds.You can’t just find £500 billion down the back of the sofa, Jean-Claude.The Brexit Department has its own detailed study too, but are keeping it private. That should change.Let’s see if unleashing ‘Project Fear’ on the Continent helps our negotiating hand.THE death of Elsie Scully-Hicks is a heart-breaking tragedy.But our revelation today of a potential conflict of interest at the heart of the Vale of Glamorgan Council shows there are still serious questions to answer.There should be no stone unturned.We must ensure that nothing like this can ever happen again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And they provide unconditional love for millions.Now, leading dog charities have warned that the consumption of dog meat here is on the rise.This sick trend cannot continue.Campaigners are calling on the Government to outlaw it.But it is horrifying that this is not already the case.America will enact legislation next month to make it illegal there.Our Government must do the same.THE Thomas Markle debacle cannot continue.How can Kensington Palace’s PR team think that forever snubbing him will help?It is about time something gave to stop this sad situation worsening.Prince Harry should step in to help orchestrate a positive resolution.The stress on Meghan, who is trying to adjust to life in Britain, is very unfair.IT is almost 40 years since Linda Lusardi first modelled for The Sun — becoming our most popular Page Three girl ever.Now, as she prepares to mark her 60th birthday, she has returned to her roots with a stunning new photo shoot.Like Madonna, who is about to reach the same milestone, she is proving age is nothing but a number.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only whites qualify.For decades, the likes of Harriet Harman have led the crusade for equality, attacking men as oppressors and demanding — rightly — that women must be protected from abuse.Harman famously refuses even to endorse marriage as the best foundation for raising a family, let alone as a good thing in itself, a public commitment.Yet she and the overwhelming majority of virtue- signalling Labour MPs are silent, for instance, on the treatment of some Muslim women by some Muslim men.I can’t recall a Labour street protest against forced ­marriage or honour killings even though they are commonplace here and reprehensible in any society. Even the Home Office feels cowed when dealing with victims.Indeed, Labour turned on its own brave MP Sarah Champion for daring to raise the issue of rampant sex-trafficking by “mainly Pakistani men”.On the Left, racism trumps rape. Now, like the “F-word”, it has become the reach-for term of abuse applied to any debate — including the issue of Britain leaving the European Union.Opposition to the EU’s ­corrupt and undemocratic “Grand Projet” long precedes the uncontrolled mass immigration unleashed by Labour.Illegal immigration is simply another symptom of EU “we know best” arrogance — personified by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Yet preposterous Tory MP Anna “Suck-It-Up” Soubry routinely slurs 17.4million referendum voters as “racist”.It is the mantra of all those who see Brexit voters — more than half the country — as thick and nasty.Odious Peter Mandelson joined in last week, avoiding the “R-word” but ludicrously accusing anyone who wants to leave the EU of “hating foreigners”, which is the same thing.“Nationalism is a hatred of foreigners,” says the slippery Euro peer. “They should not be confused with patriots.”“I voted Remain in the referendum though I entirely respect the contrary view of many others.”Mandy’s relationship with the truth has always been flaky, but this is pure cant.Even those who once worked alongside Lord Mandelson when Labour still stood for something are appalled.Ex-Home Secretary and fellow Remainer David Blunkett snapped yesterday: “The allegation that some of those voting for Leave were ‘racist’ is not a new one.“It has been bandied about and seems to me not only an insult to the many people that I used to represent who voted Leave, but also to utterly miss the point of why the majority of British people voted the way they did.“If we fail to understand, then we do ourselves, but crucially also our democracy, a great disservice.”Lord Blunkett also slammed Mandy’s call for a second referendum.He is right. It is now clear the mood has hardened against bullying Brussels.The EU’s own snide insinuations that voters here are racist “Little Englanders” has not helped.Bank of England boss Mark Carney, architect of Project Fear, sank the Pound last week by claiming chances of a clean-break Brexit were “uncomfortably high”.Trade Secretary Liam Fox warns the odds are now 60-40 against a deal.Remainers should understand that every gratuitous insult to the intelligence of decent British voters is another nail in Theresa May’s chances of a friendly ­negotiated settlement.McDonnell, cleverer than Corbyn, wants to stop Labour being dragged into what deputy leader Tom Watson calls a “vortex of eternal shame”. But McDonnell, too, is stained by anti-Jewish sentiment.In any case, Britain needs Jeremy Corbyn – to remain in place as the sullen figurehead of a blinkered Marxist rabble and remind voters what they are risking at the next election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As they handle their serrated blades the gang members – girls among them - boast that fast money is the goal, and that you live, and die, by the streets.They are mantras Joel recognises only too well. Raised in London - he doesnt want to say which part - alongside two older siblings by his single parent mum, he grew up in an environment saturated with gang culture.Family members I looked up to were deeply involved in gang culture, he tells Sun Online. I’d see them coming back with money and jewellery and I wanted some of that.By 13 he was fully involved. It’s just a natural transition. When you’re a kid you’re not saying ‘what am I in?’ - it just happens.You don’t see it as a gang – it’s family so whatever you need to do to help the family you do it, you clean the pot.The gang gave him a sense of belonging that was absent elsewhere. There’s a lot of love around you. I didn’t have a lot of male figureheads in my family so these men were my role models, showing me how to survive.But this education went hand-in-hand with casual violence in which carrying a knife was routine.From an early age I saw people getting stabbed, shooting, robbing, slapped, he says.Growing up in this lifestyle I knew I was going to die if I don’t carry one. It was a badge of honour. People asked what kind of knife you had – it was all mine is this number of inches long.His mum and older brother were unaware of his affiliations, although his sister knew.She knew I wasn’t an idiot and she always had my back. But in some ways it was a double life.Yet even as a young teen, Joel had his misgivings.There had been a few moments where I thought I’m getting in too deep. There was this gradual realisation that this life was going nowhere good, he says.A realisation cemented when, aged 15, he saw a friend shot dead in front of him at a party.Joel was talking to another friend when he heard the boom of the gunshot.I saw the guy he was shooting at, his head just went straight back and he flew back and he was not moving on the floor.He didn’t make it. And I just thought: you know what there must be more to this - it’s a cycle that’s never going to end.Breaking free was easier said than done though.It helped that my school shut down and I changed schools to an academy filled with the best basketball players with the country. I’d played a bit at my old school but when I saw the basketball scene in my new school I caught the bug.Gradually training started to replace the time he had spent with his gang, although he still saw them from time to time. There was a lot of pressure, he recalls.I’d go to a birthday party and you could feel the shift in the energy. It was all I don’t see you round here any more. The ties were loosening all the time but I knew how easily I could get pulled back in.At 16 he was chosen to play in a tournament in Virginia in the US - another turning point.Going there - you realise there’s this big world out there and I was just wow – I wanted more of it, he recalls.His coach was a big support. He sat me down and asked me what I wanted to do and where I wanted to be in five years, Joel recalls. I had never been asked that before. I had never looked ahead before, seen a future.It was the spur he needed. From then on basketball became my sole focus. I sweated blood and tears.Rain or shine I was practising. It was hard but rewarding too. Playing basketball you get a different kind of love – there’s this positive energy.Community college followed before, aged 22, Joel got an agent and started playing professional basketball, first in London and then for the Surrey Scorchers.Such was his talent that today Joel makes his living through dunk contests, putting on shows throughout the globe, from Romania to Russia, The Caribbean to the USA displaying his unique talents on the court.He knows is a world away from the streets where he used to live and to which he sometimes returns. There’s still a lot of love there for my fam. We’ve all grown up together and they respect that I’m chasing my dreams.It doesn’t stop him worrying about the next generation. I’ve got little nephews and nieces and I worry about how they are going to get on in this scary time we’re living in, he says.A time where the stakes seem ever higher.Fuelled by drill music - a form of rap which glorifies gang life, with videos displaying weapons, describing recent stabbings and issuing threats to rivals – the death toll among young teens continues to steadily rise.Meanwhile, one surgeon interviewed in Lawless Britain reveals that in the last decade attacks have become more calculated and brutal.The types of blades that are being used are more severe, there are serrated blades and the individuals seem to know here to attack people anatomically, how to attack to inflict life-changing injuries, he says.It comes as little surprise to Joel. It’s scary to hear that people want to act this way although I don’t think it’s anything new - I just think it’s more in your face, he says.Gang life is a lot more commercialised now – social media has given people easier bragging rights. Kids are trying to do it for sport, to make a name for themselves.Is there any way the tide of senseless violence can be stopped?A lot of kids are bored and lost - they haven’t got a passion, they don’t know what to do with themselves. Instead of putting more laws in place we need to give them opportunities.That’s the single biggest thing we could do. Because without hope they don’t have a chance of getting out.Joel of course knows this first hand. I’ve gained the world. And I want to say to other gangs: there’s a whole world out there they have to see - and it’s beautiful.Lawless Britain: Gangs, Knives, Killers - tonight at 10pm Channel 5Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From a distance, the animal could look like a squid.She added: The body was very soft because it was so rotten and there were long, orange stripes along the body which are the pleats of the expandable throat of the humpback whale.Perhaps these looked like tentacles from afar.Fisherman first described the 30ft globster as having eyes the size of dinner plates.The eyes, however, were actually the rotting socket joint of the whales pectoral fin.Globsters have such a peculiar appearance because of how they deteriorate.The blubber gets real soft and gooey when it rots, said Vollenweider.The animal was also probably mutilated by hungry animals.The scientists suspect that the whale might have washed up on a beach and been eaten by eagles and brown bears.It is believed that the animal was killed by a ship strike - the evidence points towards blunt force trauma to the body.In May 2018, a 20ft globster washed up in The Philippines and many locals saw it to be an omen for impending doom."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425091211-e1533570268176.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"surrey mansion for sale playhouse zip wire trampoline","story":"The jaw-dropping Pinewood House in Oxshott, Surrey, also features a 50ft ballroom, two swimming pools, cinema, bar, gym, sauna and a steam room.For gearheads it also offers an underground garage that has parking for 20 cars.And Londoners who dont want to move too far from the capital need not worry as you can see as far as Canary Wharf that is 20 miles away thanks to its observatory tower.During the First World War the Grade II listed property was owned by shipping magnate Arnold Trinder, whose fleet of ships was instrumental in breaking the German U-boat blockade.The house still has some maritime features paying tribute to Trinders time at the property.However by the 1950s it had been subdivided into three properties and was in a poor state of repair.Polish builder Andrew Holeshowski bought one of the three for less than £500,000 in 1993 and by 2007 he had bought up his neighbours properties too.Mr Holeshowski embarked on a three-year £10m renovation project to turn Pinewood back into a single home and restore its grandeur.Period features, including a fresco depicting scenes of Miltons Paradise Lost in the drawing room, have been restored.The dramatic double height Great Hall has intricately carved wooden pillars and an impressive carved stone fireplace while the ballroom has gold leaf hand-painted ceiling plasterwork and the walls of the bathroom attached are also covered in the same 24K gold leaf.The impressive home is also fitted with air conditioning, underfloor heating and dozens of hidden speakers providing music throughout the house.In total the house has 28,501 sq ft of accommodation over four floors with a grand galleried reception hall, drawing room, sitting room, ballroom, library, formal kitchen, commercial kitchen with cool room and pantry.It also has a lounge bar, wine cellar, spa room, indoor swimming pool, steam room, sauna, gym, a choice of two master bedroom suites with a dressing room and en suite bathroom, seven further bedrooms and bathrooms, an Art Deco style cinema room with triple screen and a bar area.There is also staff accommodation within the house and a separate four-bedroom cottage that could be used for guests or staff.Its hilltop position gives the house views over Crown Estate land - woodland, green fields and as far as London landmark buildings on the horizon.And the unique home is just as impressive outside in the three acres of grounds. The manicured gardens are heart-shaped, it has extensive split level terracing and its own adventure playground for the children.As well as the almost 6,000 sq ft underground car park, the house has outdoor parking for a further 15 cars by the terrace at the front of the house and there is additional staff parking for another 12 cars.Liz Berman, from Strutt and Parker, said: Pinewood House is an amazing property. Its a very grand house that sits on top of the hill, encompassed by its own gardens and not overlooked at all.Its got everything you could want and everything is immaculate. The lawns are perfectly manicured.Its definitely a London retreat, Oxshott is about 25 minutes into Waterloo station. Its very popular as that first step when people are looking to move out of London but dont want to be fully in the countryside.If you still want that civilised suburban feel this is perfect, but you are within minutes of open countryside.The house speaks for itself really, youll either love it or hate it. Its one of those houses that is very special and well known in Oxshott because it is quite grand.Even if you dont sell it to the parents, youll definitely convince the children with the incredible playhouse. The owners spent a fortune building that and its just an amazing thing.You cant keep the kids off it - its on an elevated level and has got a safety surface, its like a professional assault course.For the adults there is a beautiful indoor pool, which you can open up to the terrace, and for anyone who has a big car collection this would be perfect. It has an incredible underground parking with spaces for 20 cars."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000320747096.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"nearly one in 12 rank and file cops have to take second job to make ends meet survey finds","story":"The poll of more than 27,000 personnel by the Police Federation of England and Wales put the figure at 7.8 per cent, up 1.5 per cent on last year.Police are allowed second jobs outside working hours with approval from their force.The Federation, which represents officers from constable up to chief inspector, blamed the rise on low pay. Its survey found that 44.8 per cent worry about the state of their personal finances almost every day, 11.8 per cent hardly ever had enough money to cover all essentials and 3.8 per cent took out a payday loan last year.Federation boss John Apter said: “Our members are clearly suffering from even worse financial pressures than last year, with some appearing to be in dire straits.“Our members are under immense pressure to deliver, with dwindling resources and rising crime, leading to a demand for our services that has never been higher. All they want is to be adequately paid for the job that they do.”Last month, the Government announced a two per cent pay rise for officers, but the Federation branded that “derisory”.But the news that one in 12 have second jobs suggests that not all of the wailing about long hours and working conditions are entirely legitimate.The next time a victim is told there’s nobody available to investigate, they might wonder what their local bobbies are up to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Rosemary is a shining example of that extraordinary commitment.Over the decades Rosemary has helped to change the lives of thousands of Armed Forces personnel, veterans, and their families, and that is a legacy to be truly proud of.Rosemary is most deserving of this honour, and everyone at the Legion wishes her a very happy retirement."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425117944.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the queen held her nose when a shetland","story":"Her Majesty, 92, pinched one of her nostrils in a bid to avoid the almighty pong near the gates of Balmoral Castle in Scotland.A three-year-old steed had shunned royal protocol by defecating and leaving a pile of manure within breathing distance of the monarch.The beast, who serves as the regimental mascot of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, has crossed paths with the her before.Last year the Queen told him to “go away” when he tried to nibble her bunch of flowers during a visit to Stirling Castle in Scotland.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those being treated for an attempted overdose rose more than ten-fold — from 249 in 1997 to 2,736.As far as I am concerned, social media is almost entirely responsible.In a world where everyone relies on their phones for everything, there has never been a more worrying time for mental health.To be a teenage girl in this day and age is to be never alone — and always lonely.They are spending day after day wading through airbrushed photos of images society has deemed perfect.Whether it is a member of the Kardashian family posing with a diet pill, a boob job advert in the middle of Love Island or a photo of a friend with whitened teeth and smooth skin, our screens are filled with how we can be better — with how we SHOULD be better.Jon Goldin is vice chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists.He  said recently: “There are a range of factors putting pressure on young children — academic pressure, exam pressure, social media . . . with fear of missing out and comparing yourself unfavourably to images you see online.“If you look at social media, my hunch is that girls are probably more sensitive to some of those factors than boys.”Although suicide is still the biggest killer of men under 45, awareness of this is at an all-time high. Hospital admissions for self-harm in boys, while still too high (2,236 last year), are stable.There was a campaign (which I took part in) two weeks ago that went viral on Instagram as people were asked to signal that they were OK as a means of opening a conversation on mental health.It is a conversation that desperately needs to be had.Despite massive steps to raise awareness, not least the Royal Family getting behind the Heads Together campaign for last year’s London Marathon, the internet — and young girls’ place in it — still needs a lot of talking about.I was lucky. Instagram was only invented when I was 16 and it did not matter a jot that I did not start using it until I was 18. Although we had social media, it was in its infancy, and I am incredibly grateful for that. My phone played a very small part in my life as a teenager.24% of girls are depressed by age 1480,000 UK kids suffer from severe depression90% of teen girls unhappy with their bodies70% of young people have been cyber-bulliedAs I went through the trials of being a young, insecure girl at school, negative thoughts were not able to follow me home. I would say goodbye to the bitching at 3.30pm and eat bangers and mash with my siblings without a thought for the girls in my class — no pinging from my phone to create waves of anxiety.These days that is simply not an option.Every issue that every teenager has ever faced is magnified to an extraordinary level with the advancement of technology.But removing phones from our daughters is simply not an option. Telling a teenager they can not have the internet is to tell them they can not have friends.Ten years ago a teenage friendship could withstand a summer holiday of no contact, but now a weekend with no signal, a Tuesday night with no Instagram story, makes kids hyperventilate.To be offline is to be forgotten. It is not showing up to the only party. The party that is going on all day and, more worryingly, all night too.Self-harm is, more often than not, a cry for help.As the internet forces its way into every corner of our lives, I cannot help but feel that it is a cry for human attention for affectionate, real-life attention.Warning signs  include if a child starts talking about themself in terms of failure or if there is a  change in their eating or sleeping patterns.Try asking  open-ended questions and do not give up if they are reluctant to  respond.Do not ban social media but set a good example and do activities away from it together.If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritans (free) on 116 123.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A disgrace. Its been a waste of time. You try and do the right thing, you put your faith in the police and the CPS and they let you down.Kevin McCarthy, 60, whose son-in-laws car was also targeted, confronted the officers in the case, PCs Steve Smallman and Gemma Jackson.He said: Its been a balls up from you guys from the start to the finish. We had to push and push and push to get it this far.Hes got off because you guys and them in the court (prosecutors) havent done your jobs properly.My grandchildren were in the car after it had been attacked. Their lives were at risk because of what happened.Electrician Chris Moores, 33, who installed the cameras outside his home in Carlton Miniott, North Yorks, said: Ive no faith whatsoever in the police.How can anyone have any faith in seeing justice done when things like this happen?I know people whose cars got damaged and mine got done twice. The police didnt seem like they were getting any closer to catching who was doing it.So I installed a camera and we got him.The next day he walked past again in the same coat, same dog, everything the same.We handed it over to the police, they had nothing to do but get him charged and put before a court. They couldnt even do that properly.The CCTV footage, obtained by The Sun, shows the suspect strolling along the pavement with his frail wife and pet dog on February 25.He spots a car parked up on the kerb, looks both ways and then discreetly bends down before jabbing at the tyre and walking on.A day later the residents obtained more CCTV footage of the attacker walking his dog in broad daylight and positively identified it as Richards.Victim Jonathan Sharpehouse told the court: I looked at the footage and knew it was Bryn.He walks passed my house every day and Ive known him for 20-25 years. He was with his wife and his dog.Prosecutor Gareth Henderson-Moore told JPs: It was crucial evidence without which the crown could not proceed with the case.”But Mrs Simon - addressing the late disclosure of the CCTV - said: Courts are getting concerned that the CPS are failing to comply with directions.This is becoming very regular. I am not happy and Im quite sure my colleagues are not happy that the CPS are not complying with directions.We have to decide if Mr Richards is going to get a fair trial. This is a question the CPS should be asking itself long before a trial comes to court.You should be trial ready when you come to court.Richards, from Sandhutton, North Yorks, denied criminal damage at Harrogate Magistrates Court and insisted it was a case of mistaken identity.A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: Were sorry we let the villagers down in this case.“We acknowledge the magistrates comments, and we recognise that we should have done better.“We will review the quality of the investigation to establish what happened and ensure lessons are learned.Richards was originally charged with eight separate slashing attacks but the CPS dropped seven charges at the start of his farcical trial.A CPS spokesperson said: We note the comments of the magistrate and will review our handling of the case.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I thought the tyres had blown. Then the taxi driver put his hands over his face and started crying and praying. Suddenly everything was shaking.“Trees were coming down around us and there were huge rocks and bits of rubble falling everywhere.“Once the earthquake finished the driver took us to a Sheraton hotel, but it had been virtually destroyed.“Hotel staff said we needed to get somewhere high because of the risk of a tsunami. So we abandoned our luggage and climbed up the side of a wooded mountain.There were hundreds of people, locals and tourists, all helping one other.“After two hours we went back down and the hotel staff provided makeshift beds in the car park.”Around 13,000 buildings are believed to have been destroyed, just a week after a 6.4-magnitude earthquake killed 14 people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The rest of our stuff is still in storage but we’ve only got that until August 8.After that, we’ve got no money to put our stuff anywhere so it’s most likely going to be destroyed. We are absolutely stuck.”The mum is now expected to meet with Target Housing, a charity that helps find temporary housing for people at risk of homelessness.Ms Tomassi had lived in her home for three years but was aware that neighbours often complained about her son’s behaviour and angry outbursts.The mum also suffered a health emergency two years ago after suffering a heart attack and being subsequently diagnosed with fibromuscular dysplasia – a condition which causes the arteries to narrow.Shortly after, she developed anxiety and depression, and claims her benefits were stopped during the same period.Following the eviction order, Tomassi was allegedly offered emergency housing, but she declined and chose to move in with a friend nearby.She then rented two garages for £18 a week to store her possessions and furniture.However, she has now fallen on hard times and claims she can no longer afford the fees for the storage space which she is due to empty on August 8.The mum previously opened up to Hull Daily Mail, saying she had never been in in this kind of situation before.She said: On Tuesday night we all went to sit in the garage at 10.30pm and my little one started crying.“He said ‘I’m not staying here anymore’ and he was crying his heart out.“He ran back to the flat and wouldn’t stop crying. It was heartbreaking.“It’s awful to see my children like that and it’s stressing me out because I can’t do anything.“We are all crammed into a living room with two on a double mattress, one on the settee and one on the chair with a pouffe.”Tomassi has appealed her eviction, adding: “I just feel like the council haven’t given us a chance. I’ve tried to get the benefits back and I am doing my best but I’m not a miracle worker.“My Jobseeker’s Allowance stopped because I had no address and I need to reapply. Meals are hard to come by and the money I am on isn’t enough.While Hull City Council claims to be working with the family to resolve the issue, the authority said appropriate action must be taken when substantial amounts of rent are owed.A spokeswoman told Hull Daily Mail: “If a tenant is having difficulties complying with their tenancy agreement we always try to work with tenants to solve any problems, with eviction being the last resort.“In Ms Tomassi’s case, we were left with no option but eviction due to escalating rent arrears and the detrimental effect of her behaviour in the neighbourhood.“She and her children were offered emergency accommodation, which she refused. We are continuing to work with partners with regard to Ms Tomassi and her family’s circumstances.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425132515.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"12 labour mps in secret plot to oust jeremy corbyn hold secret summit at farmhouse and plot how to take back control","story":"Sources told the  that a gang of around 12 MPs have been holding secret away days to discuss how to take back control of the party.A group of them are reported to have caught the same 7.18 train from Waterloo East on a Thursday night to Stonegate, before getting a taxi to the luxury estate Fair Oak Farm in Sussex.The fightback has been taking place at the £144-a-night grade II listed farmhouse, built in the 1600s.The paper claims the attendees includes a string of moderate MPs which include former leadership candidate Liz Kendall, and former shadow cabinet members Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie. Meetings are said to have taken place in other locations too - and a potential rebel list of more than 20.The reports come as Jeremy Corbyn is still desperately fighting to get a grip on the anti-Semitism crisis engulfing his own party.A source at the meetings told the : “We are getting together regularly to discuss how to take back control of the party.“At some point the Corbyn leadership is going to fail and collapse, we only need to see what is happening with the anti-Semitism problem, and we need to be ready to step in, win the leadership rebuild the party as a credible force and repair the damage that has been done.”Another attendee at the away days told the Express: “As things stand Labour could win the next election simply because the Tories have made such a mess over Brexit and look so incompetent.“If that happens we will break away and either form a separate Labour Party within parliament or a new party.“There are [Remainer] Conservative and Lib Dem MPs who are interested in joining us if we do form a new party because of Brexit.”The MP added: “The issue would be then whether we would have time to create a proper identity before an election or if there would need to be an election soon after. In that sense it is complicated.”But Corbyn-critic Stephen Kinnock, who was also said to have attended the away day, said he could not recall the meeting.He said: “Hand on heart I have no clue about that.

Yes it is its largest military player. Yes we are a cultural powerhouse. Yes we are their biggest individual market. Britain is powerful - but the EU is more powerful than we are.On paper - this should not be surprising, yet no politician, of any stripe, would ever dare say it.But the facts speak for themselves: We are 65 million of a bloc of 450 million. Ours is a $2.9trn (\u0026#1632.2trn) economy, they are $19trn (\u0026#16314.6trn) They represent 44% of our exports. We, just 9% of theirs. They are 27 - we are one.The impact of a no deal (as all the studies show) would be considerable but they have a crucial advantage: they are able to spread the risk and burden. For that reason, the same studies show, it would hurt us far more. We have nowhere else to turn.This should not be surprising. Imagine another country taking Britain\u0027s place - that we had \u0027Frexit\u0027 or \u0027Nexit\u0027 or \u0027Spexit\u0027 or even \u0027Deutschexit\u0027, ask yourself where the power would lie. It would be with the remaining states of the union.That we struggle to come to terms with that is, I think, deeply revealing of the British psyche.This imbalance was obscured through years of membership - we had no need to confront our own relative weakness as a member of the club - but now we are outside, that asymmetry of power is exposed for all to see.That is why we have accepted concession after concession, not because of Theresa May\u0027s pusillanimity but because of the hard truths of realpolitik.That is why Mrs May and her ministers have been conducting a grand tour of Europe. Not because they want yet more sea bass and asparagus in yet another state dinner, but because they recognise how powerful they are as a bloc and how isolated we are in their face.They want to tear them asunder, to divide and conquer - this is what David Davis said would happen during the referendum. Yet, they have remained, in 18 months a united set of two, while our own house, our own government, has been fatally divided.Time and again throughout our history, Britain has acted to prevent the emergence of a hegemonic power which controlled all of Europe, aware that Britain, even with an empire, could not resist a united continent\u0027s gravitational pull. Today\u0027s crop of politicians, seem to have forgotten that lesson. Looked at through the psychology of the British public\u0027s collective psyche, we can see Mrs May as the Wizard of Oz - less powerful than her people think, or than our population would like others to believe.That is what is invidious about Brexit for British politicians - for the British public to accept Chequers, or something like it, would essentially be to ask the British people to accept a downgrade of their own view of British power, a downgrade of the sort of country we think we should be and that we think we are.We are not an especially jingoistic nation, but that is much to stomach. It is a view which, however unfair, would be repeated and churned by the exact Brexiteers who, from Mrs May\u0027s point of view, forced us to accept the downgrade in the first place."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-brexit-fox_4381580.jpg?20180805182151 ","title":"liam fox faces ridicule over u turn on brexit no deal","story":"So what has changed? A lot, actually. The Chequers deal has bombed with Tory MPs and activists, including members of the PM\u0027s own association in Maidenhead.Two senior cabinet ministers, David Davis and Boris Johnson, have resigned, with Mr Davis\u0027s former lieutenants Steve Baker and Stewart Jackson now acting as pro-Brexit attack dogs.Mr Johnson, meanwhile, is now firmly re-installed as the darling of the Tory grassroots and the hot favourite with the activists to replace Mrs May as party leader and prime minister.Then there has been the reaction to the Chequers deal from Michel Barnier, accused by Dr Fox in his Sunday Times interview of \"intransigence\" and of making no deal more likely. In his lofty, patrician manner and with customary \"hauteur\", Mr Barnier picked the Chequers plan apart clause by clause, to the extent that even its biggest fans fear it is now mort dans l\u0027eau.And that\u0027s one reason why Theresa May was probably wasting her time when she went to the French president\u0027s Riviera retreat and told him Brussels faces a choice between the Chequers deal and no deal.When I went to Strasbourg for Emmanuel Macron\u0027s address to the European Parliament in April, I was told by senior MEPs that the president and Mr Barnier are extremely close politically.As a result, President Macron - probably the EU\u0027s chief powerbroker now that Angela Merkel\u0027s authority is waning - will ensure that his \"uncle\" succeeds Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission next year.No wonder President Macron told Mrs May at Napoleon\u0027s stronghold of Fort Bregancon that he was not willing to break the Brexit deadlock by breaking ranks with the EU\u0027s negotiators.\"There is absolutely no intention to speak in place of Monsieur Barnier,\" a French diplomat was reported to have said, confirming the president\u0027s close alignment with Mr Barnier.And so in spite of Mrs May\u0027s Riviera charm offensive, there has at the same time been a significant change in tone in the government\u0027s Brexit language in recent weeks, as the Chequers plan has faced derision and rejection. First there has been what Brexiteers claim has been a return of \"project fear\" scare stories, about stockpiling of food and medicines, lorry gridlock at Dover, long queues at border control and customs and fees for travel visas.But the biggest change in tone has come in the Foreign Office, where Boris Johnson\u0027s clown-like bluster and looseness with facts and detail have been replaced by the more thoughtful approach of Jeremy Hunt.Instead of Mr Johnson\u0027s gung-ho and cavalier approach to Brexit, former Remainer Mr Hunt has been deadly serious in his warnings of the risk of \"no deal by accident\" increasing by the day.Then last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney - denounced as \"the high priest of Project Fear\" by Jacob Rees-Mogg - said the risk of no deal was \"uncomfortably high and highly undesirable\".Are all these dire warnings aimed at putting pressure on Brussels to sign up to a deal? Almost certainly. Will they work? Probably not. But then some hardline Brexiteers on the Tory backbenches have always favoured no deal.The danger for the prime minister, however, is that the more no deal looks likely the louder the calls from pro-Remain MPs and campaigners for a second referendum - a so-called \"people\u0027s vote\" - will become."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-uk-weather-river-stour_4382175.jpg?20180806154214 ","title":"make the most of it before heatwave cools off","story":"It follows a sweltering weekend across the UK where the hottest temperature of 30.2C (86.36F) was recorded in Northolt, Greater London, on Sunday.The mercury is set to rise past 30C (85F) in parts of the UK on Monday, with 33C (91F) possible in London and to the east of the capital, the Met Office said.A level three heat health warning for the South East was issued as a result, with a 90% chance of heatwave conditions for the region between Monday and Wednesday.

The 27-year-old all-rounder is accused of punching Ryan Hale, 27, to the ground and then allegedly knocking out Ryan Ali, 28, a short time later during a fracas in the early hours of September 25 last year. A jury at Bristol Crown Court heard that Stokes mocked a gay couple and verbally abused a bouncer before knocking out the two men. Stokes, 27, “lost control” after a boozy night out in a club, it was alleged. He appeared in court yesterday with Ali, 28, and Hale, 27, who were both punched by the sportsman. The first day of their affray trial heard that “aggressive” Stokes knocked out Army veteran Hale then put fireman Ali in hospital with a fractured eye socket. But England all-rounder Stokes insisted his use of force was “reasonable and justified”, and claimed the brawl was sparked by “nasty homophobic language” by the two men he floored. All three co-defendants deny affray. Prosecutor Nicholas Corsellis told the jury Stokes’ violence was “not a trivial moment of unpleasantness” and that the star “lost his control” and attacked out of “revenge or retaliation”. The violence erupted in Bristol city centre last September. Stokes and England teammate Alex Hales, 29, were out drinking in the hours after the team’s victory over the West Indies, while Ali and Hale were \u0026shycelebrating a work promotion.  All four were in the Mbargo club in the city but did not bump into each other until the early hours when trouble began on a nearby street, the jury heard. Mr Corsellis said the cricketers returned to the nightclub after closing time at 2am and tried to get back in after they had left an hour earlier. The court was told doorman Andrew Cunningham refused them entry – despite the pair offering \u0026pound60. Mr Corsellis said Stokes verbally abused the bouncer, telling him his gold teeth “make you look like a c***” and that his tattoos were “sh**”. CCTV footage played to the court showed Stokes outside the club with Mr Hales. Stokes allegedly began to mimic two gay men – Kai Barry and William O’Connor – who had just left the venue. Mr Corsellis said video showed Stokes throwing a cigarette butt at the Mr O’Connor’s head. The court was told the bouncer told Stokes: “If you are going to start on anyone, start on me.” Mr Corsellis said footage showed Stokes and Mr Hales “sharing a moment of hilarity” at the expense of Mr O’Connor, before Stokes tried to shake hands with the bouncer. When Mr Cunningham refused, Stokes was caught on camera gesticulating wildly. Mr Corsellis said: “It seemed to enrage him, the hand gestures, the head \u0026shymovement back. It all needs to be viewed in the context of the doorman, the mimicking of an openly gay man, that sets out his state of mind… “Mr Stokes’ behaviour outside the club set a clear tone for what happened that night… He took to acting in a provocative and offensive way.”  Bristol crown court heard that Ali told police he and Hale met the gay couple in the club earlier in the evening and “had their bottoms felt” by one of them but that it was light-hearted. However, the jury was told CCTV showed Mr Barry touch Ali “inappropriately” in the groin area, prompting him to push Mr Barry away. The court heard that shortly afterwards Stokes became involved in the apparent altercation with Ali and Hale, later saying he was coming to the defence of Mr Barry and Mr O’Connor. Student Max Wilson recorded the brawl on his phone. He said the group acted “like football hooligans”. Mr Corsellis said: “He did not believe the initial shove came from either Mr Stokes or Mr Hales, but later in the incident he described how Mr Stokes continued to behave in an aggressive manner, ignoring Mr Hales’ attempts to calm him down.” In Mr Wilson’s footage a man’s voice is heard shouting “enough, enough”. The court was told Ali was seen holding a bottle, raising it and motioning as if to hit Mr Hales, but then striking out at Mr Barry. Hale and Ali seemingly tried to retreat but Stokes began throwing punches while Mr Hales told him “that’s enough”, the court was told. Mr Corsellis added: “There’s a big difference between using violence to defend someone and… violence to retaliate or to punish the person who has had the temerity to attack you. “This is what you see from Mr Stokes… everyone except him wanted to stop. Mr Ali moved away, Mr Hales was saying ‘Stokes, Stokes, that’s enough’, and tried to get hold of him on two occasions to stop the violence. “This is retaliation, retribution, not self-defence.” The court heard that Hale said to Stokes “f***you”. Stokes then knocked him out and CCTV shows Hale on his back.  Mr Corsellis said: “[Stokes] then turned to Mr Ali who had no weapon on him, on to the second assault on the second man.” The court heard that Hale staggered to his feet, ran around the corner and levered a metal bar from a road sign, before racing back to the brawl, although it appears he never used it. Ali and Hale, both from Bristol, were treated in hospital. Hale had a 1.5-inch cut on his forehead. Stokes, from Castle Eden, Co Durham, had no obvious injuries except for a swollen hand. Following his arrest at the scene, Stokes said he acted in the way he did “because he was abusing my two friends for being gay”.

Matthew Scully-Hicks, 32, began adoption proceedings of daughter Elsie several years ago, along with his husband, Craig. A stay-at-home father, he went on to portray himself as the perfect parent, telling family and friends how in love he was with little Elsie. Pictures showed him playing the doting dad, cuddling, playing and waving with the youngster, with a huge smile on his face. Neighbours, friends and colleagues spoke warmly of Matthew, who appeared to be part of the very model of a modern, happy family. While Craig would go to work, he looked after their princess at their four-bedroom home in an upmarket area in Wales. But looks can be deceiving, Wales Online reports.  Just weeks after the formal adoption of Elsie went through, the baby was dead, murdered by father Matthew at just 18 months old. The part-time fitness instructor had completed the rigorous adoption process without a hitch, and without any concerns being raised. It looked like he, with Craig, could give Elsie the new start she needed. When the little girl was taken to hospital over the months before her death with injuries, medical staff accepted the explanations offered. However, there was something sinister and sad going on. Unable to cope with the demands of parenthood, 32-year-old Matthew was physically abusing his little daughter under the noses of professionals, family, friends, and even his husband. This was not a case where a family went under the radar of those in authority - they received regular visits from staff during the adoption process, health visitors would later call as they do with any new family, and medical staff would see Elsie at hospital.  But Matthew\u0027s subsequent trial, and a review by social services, would lay bare the terrible details of his daughter\u0027s short life. The painful reality is that the abuse of Elsie was hidden in plain sight. The lives of Elsie and Matthew began in very different places. She was taken into care shortly after birth because of concerns about her mother\u0027s drug use, while he was born into and grew up in a loving family. Without adoption, their lives would never have crossed. Elsie was placed with the couple in September 2015, and six months later the newly-formed family moved to a home in the upmarket Cardiff suburb of Llandaff. Matthew\u0027s husband, Craig, described how he had hoped to adopt a “Daddy’s little princess” and said Elsie was “great” apart from sleeping and at meal times. Elsie was physically tiny and delicate but had a “brash and bouncy” personality, he would later tell Cardiff Crown Court. A health visitor described her as “a very happy, smiley child” and said she was loving life, she was lovely - smiles all round.  Vivian Cownie, a former colleague of Matthew, would later describe him as a very proud father, a caring and loving father who would do anything for his child. On November 5 that year, Elsie suffered a leg injury, the first in a series of injuries she was to sustain. The infant was X-rayed on November 12 at the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board Trauma and Orthopaedics Clinic and found to have broken her right tibia above her ankle. In fact, she had also suffered a second fracture of the leg - above her right knee - but that was not picked up until after her death. Matthew claimed he had been looking after her alone when he saw her fall while standing at an activity table in the kitchen. He claimed at various times that she may have fallen from standing or while pushing a walker, twisting her leg in the process. During his trial he would say that perhaps his daughter had been suffering from Vitamin D deficiency, or rickets, which could have made her more likely to suffer fractures.  A medical expert would tell the jury that he had never seen fractures of both bones like the ones suffered by Elsie in a child of her age, adding: “I have seen them in adults in more major traumas such as car accidents or falls from height.” Just a month after the leg fractures, Elsie suffered a horrific bruise to her face - a health visitor advised Matthew to seek medial treatment for the injury but he did not. Matthew claimed Elsie was pulling herself up on a toy kitchen, holding on to the doors when they opened and “she literally went face first down towards the edge” of the unit. The injury happened at the same time as an adoption review and Elsie was seen by her social worker, an adoption social worker and an independent reviewing officer - but the presence of the bruise was not recorded. Five days later, a health professional also saw the bruise but did pass on the information. By January 18, little Elsie had another bruise on her face, which again went unchecked by medics. But on March 10, 2016, Matthew did call for help - he rang 999 and said daughter had fallen down the stairs at their Wellwright Road home.  He told the call-handler she had vomited a number of times, and was now unresponsive. Elsie was rushed to hospital where her injuries were noted as being consistent with such a fall, and she was allowed home after four hours’ observation. Only one person knows precisely how the toddler came by those injuries over the months in her new home. To the outside world, Matthew presented as a loving and proud stay-at-home dad, and it seems no alarm bells were heard by those in a position to intervene. But in text messages to his husband, who was spending much of his time working away from home, he described Elsie as Satan dressed up in a Baby grow, a psycho and the exorcist. On May 12, 2016, Elsie was legally adopted by Craig and Matthew Scully-Hicks. The family was now formally complete. On May 25, Matthew took Elsie shopping for clothes to wear at a party to celebrate her adoption - he sent pictures of outfits at Marks \u0026amp Spencer to his husband, and bought one for her to wear.  But at 6.18pm that same day, he made a 999 call saying his daughter had collapsed. He told the operator: I was just changing my daughter for bed and she went all floppy and limp. When police and paramedics arrived at their home at 6.26pm, the 18-month-old was not breathing and was in cardiac arrest. Matthew claimed he had changed Elsie’s nappy on the rug in the living room, and had then taken her clothes and dirty nappy away - when he returned two or three minutes later, she was on the floor but was not breathing or moving. Elsie died in the University Hospital of Wales four days later. Tests revealed she had suffered three separate areas of bleeding on her brain, retinal bleeding, a skull fracture, and three broken ribs. South Wales Police launched an investigation. The truth of what happened to Elsie emerged during the subsequent four-week murder trial at Cardiff Crown Court. Matthew had murdered her, had assaulted and abused his daughter for seven months before violently shaking her and causing her catastrophic injury.  The jurors heard contrasting evidence of the fitness instructor’s warm, loving nature but also of the frustrated, angry tone of his text messages to his husband, and how he would scream at Elsie. They were also presented with a wealth of medical evidence. During the trial, they heard from consultant paediatrician Stephen Rose, who said it was likely that Elsie Scully-Hicks had been shaken violently and that her head had been rocked backwards and forwards so that her head was flexed down on to her chest and flexed backwards. He told the jury: This mechanism would then cause the subdural bleeding, or the bleeds around the brain, and the retinal haemorrhages and also it would cause her to stop breathing. Referring to the toddler\u0027s skull fracture, he said: There must have been a cause of the fracture skull fractures don’t occur spontaneously and so the only mechanism for a skull fracture is if there was a blow to the head, either during the shaking injury which culminated in Elsie being thrown against a hard floor, or possibly her head being knocked against a wall.  After four days of deliberations, the jury returned its verdict - Matthew was guilty of murdering his daughter. The defendant - who was dubbed a \u0027Jekyll and Hyde\u0027 character by a family court judge - was subsequently sentenced to life in prison. He must serve a minimum term of 18 years behind bars. Sentencing Matthew, Mrs Justice Davies described Elsie as a young, vulnerable and defenceless child whom the defendant had previously injured. She said: In deliberately inflicting serious injuries upon your 18-month-old adoptive daughter you abused the trust which had been placed in you as Elsie’s adoptive father. It was a gross abuse of that trust. It was an abuse of the responsibility which had been placed upon you as her adoptive father to protect and care for this young, vulnerable and defenceless child. Your actions in killing Elsie have devastated three families – the birth family of Elsie, the family you had sought to build with Craig Scully-Hicks and your own birth family. You were living in comfortable social circumstances with the close support of professional agencies, your husband and wider family.  To those who saw you regularly, be it healthcare professionals, social workers or friends and family you were a loving and caring father. She added: To no one, not even your husband, did you have the courage to speak of your difficulties. You put your own self-interest before that of the young child you had been entrusted to protect. In separate family court proceedings conducted before the trial but only reveled afterwards, it emerged that a judge had completely exonerated Matthew\u0027s husband Craig of any failure to protect Elsie. Speaking after the trial, Elsie’s birth grandmother, Sian O’Brien, revealed the anguish of the family. She accepted that at the time of giving birth, her daughter was living a chaotic lifestyle and was not in a position to care for her baby. But she said the family continued to have contact with the child - originally named Shayla O\u0027Brien - while she was in the care of the foster family. And she said that in January 2015 she had started proceedings in the family court to become her legal . The grandmother said: We all continue to fight on even though every day we are numb with pain and hurt deep in the knowledge that Shayla was loved unconditionally by us all as a family and knowing that had she not been taken away from us, she would still be alive today.  Despite this decision and Shayla being in foster care, we as a family were still able to have weekly contact with her and we saw her without fail at every opportunity. In August 2015, out of nowhere, we were told by social services that we had to go and see Shayla as soon as possible and say goodbye for the final time as a suitable adoptive family had been found for her. This was completely devastating for us all. She added: A person who had been deemed by the authorities to be a fit and proper person to bring up my granddaughter was responsible for her death, and they took her from me telling me I would be unable to cope. Following the death of Elsie, a child practice review undertaken by Cardiff and Vale Regional Child Safeguarding Board found professionals saw the youngster\u0027s injuries in isolation, lacked professional curiosity and accepted the explanations given by Matthew. The report said that Matthew and his partner presented as a well-educated and articulate couple and very positive parents for this child. As a result, there was a lack of professional curiosity regarding the child’s experiences and injuries. The report said the professionals involved in the case viewed the adoptive placement as being very successful, and it criticised the recording of incidents and communication between agencies claiming no one agency held all the relevant information on this child.

Today our first motorway is better known for its jams, long delays and stressful journeys as 300,000 cars squeeze on to its 193 miles every day. But the M1, which links London with Leeds, is about to turn 60. So a TV documentary has lifted the lid on this iconic north-south route. Here we journey through its history, picking up fascinating facts along the way...   PLANS  A nationwide motorway network was discussed as early as 1923 but the Second World War and cash shortages meant it only got the go-ahead in the 1950s. The first motorway section was the eight mile Preston bypass (now part of the M6), opened in 1958. But three years earlier, Sir Owen Williams, who designed the old Wembley, was asked to deliver the first part of the ambitious M1, a 54-mile stretch linking Watford (Junction 5) with Crick/Rugby (J18).   CONSTRUCTION  Digging started in 1957 but Williams changed the design from two lanes to three. There were 132 futuristic bridges but no crash barriers, central reservation or lighting. It was one of the biggest projects the country had seen yet Sir Owen brought it in on time, 19 months later, and on its budget of \u0026pound16m. Architectural critic Jonathan Glancey said: “They were building a national road for the first time since the Romans – with incredible speed. “It was a mile every eight days and a bridge every three days.” (When 14 miles was made four lanes in 2009 it took three years.) Some 5,000 workers shifted 20 million tonnes of earth and rock.  OPENING  Transport Secretary Ernest Marples opened the M1 on November 2, 1959, but seemed horrified by the speed of the traffic, muttering: “My God, what have I started?” His speech warned that “the speed is so great the senses may be numbed and judgment warped”. That was because the M1 had no speed limit. Ex- traffic cop Les Barker, who patrolled from day one, said: “It was designated a ‘special road’ and free of speed restrictions. So all hell let loose.”   MOTORWAY MADNESS  Cars were hurtling along at more than 100mph yet families would stop on the hard shoulder to picnic, stroll or snooze. The unofficial M1 speed record was set in April 1964 on a stretch near Northampton. The AC Cobra was due to race in the Le Mans 24 hour and the weekend before, in the early hours of the morning, its drivers opened up the throttle near Watford Gap services. They hit 185mph, sparking a police probe and a front page Daily Mirror story. In 1965 the 70mph limit was trialled and went nationwide in 1967. Congestion means the average M1 speed today is just 47.5mph.  BREAKDOWNS  While drivers got the speed bug their cars weren’t used to doing over 50mph and many overheated. On day one, out of 13,000 vehicles, 100 broke down in the first 10 miles. The first AA trucks had rubber bumpers to push vehicles to safety and mechanics had unusual ways to alert cars to hazards. One AA man said: “I’d tip petrol on rags, set fire to it and throw it into the road. When the rags had been used up I used to throw the rest of the petrol across the motorway and set fire to it. “But it didn’t stop all of them – they’d go through the flames into the cars in the accident.”  TRADE  The M1 proved a huge boost to firms and the majority of freight moved off the railways on to motorways. Today, almost everything we buy travels by motorway. On an average Wednesday truckers will drive one million miles in 24 hours on the M1.   SERVICE STATIONS  There are 14 service stations and in the 1960s they were considered the height of sophistication. People would travel to them especially for a meal out and some even had silver service restaurants. Watford Gap’s Blue Boar services became a hotspot for the music stars of the Swinging 60s, with bands on tour stopping to meet up. The Beatles, The Hollies and The Rolling Stones were all regulars and pop mags told fans it was “the place where you can meet the stars for the price of a cup of tea”. When Jimi Hendrix first came to London he thought the Blue Boar was a nightclub where he should play.  SIGNS  In 1958 graphic designers Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert revamped road signs in readiness for the motorway era. Old signs varied widely and were in capital letters – hard to read on the move. Kinneir and Calvert rigorously tested type sizes and styles, colours and backgrounds. Their designs were three times bigger than old ones. Those signs are still used today and are considered design classics.  ACCIDENTS \u0026amp CLOSURES  In 1958 there were 4.5 million cars compared to 28 million today but there were twice as many fatalities on early motorways as there are today. In March 1972 nine people died when 200 vehicles crashed in thick fog on the M1 near Luton. The M1 has also been shut due to bomb scares, movie filming, fires and extreme weather.

It was hilarious. “It had millions of views on their social media platforms. It was so surreal. “I thought that would be it and it would be a one off but then that summer she was asked to do another one.” The mum of three, who also has sons Harrison Evered, 10, and Nathan Evered, seven, with her finance consultant husband Andrew Evered, 40, said ‘diva’ Scarlett loves the attention. Victoria said: “There was an open day at my son’s school and his teacher came up and said ‘do you know who she’s the exact double of?’ “People comment on it all the time. You’ll be in the supermarket and people come up and say she looks just like her.  “Quite often I’ll see people smiling at me and I know what they’re going to say. I’ve not had anyone think I’ve actually stolen the princess though – thank God. “It happens especially if her hair is down because the parting falls in a similar way to Princess Charlotte’s. “Scarlett’s taken to saying ‘I’m not Princess Charlotte, I’m Scarlett’. And as she gets older she’s becoming much more aware of it. “When we’re out and about and people say it she laughs and smiles. She does love the attention.” Scarlett, who is now signed with three agencies - Scarlett Entertainment, Susan Scott and Lookalikes - did three viral videos for Asda in 2016. The toddler also appeared in a video for Pizza Express to mark Prince George’s third birthday. Stay-at-home mum Victoria also entered her into a Netvouchercodes competition to find the best lookalike which she won in April 2017. Scarlett was then asked to open up a Christmas fairground at a Dreamland event in Margate, Kent, last year with Prince William lookalike Simon Watkinson and Duchess of Cambridge lookalike Heidi Agan.  Victoria said: “It was lovely for her. She got to walk around the park and meet Father Christmas and got to go ice skating before everybody else arrived. “They took pictures of her with the other lookalikes on the ice rink then people were coming over to speak to her. “She loved it. She’s a very sociable, friendly, outgoing little girl and it comes very naturally to her. “This year to mark the birth of the royal baby she did a campaign for My 1st Years’ Royal Collection. That was her first modelling campaign and she really took to it.  “They were in their dressing gowns being babysat by a Meghan Markle lookalike which got a lot of coverage in magazines and papers. “It was because Prince George wore one of those dressing gowns when he met President Obama. “She was brilliant. She knows Hayden (Ursell) who plays Prince George really well and the other lookalikes are always really professional. “It doesn’t seem like she’s doing any work. She’s just having fun.” Spending time around so many royal doppelgangers – and being one – does sometimes leave Scarlett confused. The little girl has been known to think she’s watching herself on TV when she’s actually watching the princess.  Victoria said: “I always show her Princess Charlotte on the television and a couple of times she’s thought it’s actually her. “When the royal baby was born she thought she was watching Simon who is the Prince William lookalike. “Scarlett has got lighter hair and a different eye colour. She’s not exactly the same but they definitely have some sort of resemblance. “Scarlett does like Princess Charlotte. She always looks at her dresses and what she’s wearing. I think she’d be happy to copy her clothes. “I’ll be over the moon if she can continue to do it. We have a lovely memory book of all her press cuttings so that she can see it when she’s older.

Its three-month outlook does not suggest the hot weather will last that long but it may be warmer than average, according to Bonnie Diamond, of the Met Office. The outlook - used by planners, businesses and government to start plotting weather-related decisions - shows an increased chance of high-pressure systems close to the UK, meaning settled conditions are more likely than unsettled weather from our typical Atlantic weather systems. Ms Diamond said: This means there is an increased likelihood of warmer-than-average temperatures and below-average rainfall. It must be noted, however, that this does not necessarily mean temperatures will be hot or that a \u0027heatwave will continue\u0027, as above-average temperatures can mean one or two degrees above average, for which August, September and October are 19, 16 and 13 Celsius respectively. Further, warmer-than-average temperatures does not necessarily mean sunshine - it can be warm and cloudy too.  Temperatures could potentially peak at 34C (91.4F) in Essex or Norfolk on Tuesday, after a balmy weekend where the hottest temperature on Sunday was 30.2C (86.36F) recorded in Northolt, Greater London, the Met Office said. However, not all of the UK will be gazing into clear blue skies - much of Scotland and Northern Ireland will start the week with some rain. England and Wales are to stay generally dry and warmer, with the exception of possible thunderstorms across the south east on Tuesday. The mercury will need to climb significantly if it is to come close to England\u0027s current August record - 38.5C (101.3F) reached in Faversham, Kent, in 2003.  However, maximum temperatures are likely to dip to around the mid-20Cs mark come Wednesday. Forecaster Dean Hall said there will be quite a marked change to the feel of things from the middle of the week as conditions turn fresher and more changeable. It is likely to stay cooler throughout next weekend, he said, with no real sign of any return of the heat that we have been seeing over the recent days. It comes amid a sweltering European heatwave, with holidaymakers in Portugal and Spain feeling the brunt of the sun. The mercury is being driven higher by a hot air mass moving north from Africa, bringing dust from the Sahara Desert.  British holidaymakers abroad are being warned to avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day and to keep hydrated. Last week, local records were smashed in eight areas of Portugal, while Lisbon broke a 37-year-old record, with the thermometers reaching 44C (111.2F) on Sunday. Red health alerts for extreme heat have been issued for more than half the country, with thermometers passing 46C (114.8F) over the weekend. The hot, dry conditions led to several Portuguese wildfires. In Spain, heat warnings were issued for 41 of the country\u0027s 50 provinces. The stifling conditions played a part in the deaths of two men, one in Barcelona and the other in the southern region of Murcia, according to Spanish authorities.

Kirsten Ashby was left with no finger tips, no ears and layers of her skin on her face melted away. The 27-year-old\u0027s injuries were so severe her face was left unrecognisable from the third degree burns, which she said made her feel like a monster as people stare at her in the street. Kirsten said she nearly died in hospital, until she saw her daughter Madison, nine, in a dream while she was in an induced coma. She came out of the coma after four weeks - but she still wasn\u0027t allowed to see nine-year-old Maddison for a few more weeks - and when she did her little girl was too scared to touch her.  She told TalkRadio: She kept on looking at my hands, my arms and my skin. So I said to her, \u0027Do you want to stroke my arm? It feels like a lizard.\u0027 At first she was, \u0027No, no, no.\u0027 She was afraid of hurting me. It took her a couple of visits. Kirsten had been drinking wine with friend Lauren Russell on November 17 last year when Lauren felt unwell. Kirsten tried to help by calling an ambulance but Lauren\u0027s boyfriend Raymond Bowen reacted by throwing petrol over her.  Kirsten said he stood smoking a cigarette as he lit the flammable liquid with a lighter and looked smug as she was set ablaze. Bowen was jailed for 19 years over the attack in April which was extended to life by the Court of Appeal because the sentence was considered too lenient . Recalling the horror, Kirsten added: I was running my hands through my hair, trying to get the fire out. Then I just remember falling down on my knees. I couldn\u0027t run out of the door to get water because the two kids were standing there. \u0027And I couldn\u0027t run to the other side of the room because he had spilled alcohol over the floor. If I\u0027d have been there the whole flat could have gone up.   The next time she opened her eyes she saw her neighbours and two big yellow blobs - which were actually policemen. She didn\u0027t wake up again until she was in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. She didn\u0027t recognise herself when she eventually looked in the mirror. It was awful but I kind of shut off, she said. I\u0027m quite numb to it. So I\u0027m sure that I\u0027ve still got quite a lot of emotion to go through. After 11 weeks she was able to see her daughter, but it wasn\u0027t until May that she could leave the hospital to live with her parents Lynn and Paul Ashby and Madison at their home in Milton Keynes, in Buckinghamshire  She has had to have several operations to start rebuilding her face and body since the horror attack and has been left feeling itchy and emotionally numb. She said she has suffered burns to her hands, arms, chest, half of her back and her face. She has had to have skin grafts taken from both of her legs to replace the skin, which has left her in a lot of pain and in and out of bandages as her skin keeps breaking down. She says children and adult stare at her now, but she has bravely learnt to live with it. Her parents previously said they were told to expect the worst as she was not expected to survive the horrific ordeal. They described her as a stubborn soul and her recovery, much of which had been in isolation due to the risk of contracting an infection, was a slow and painful process. Mrs Ashby said she was kept in bandages from head to toe as skin had been taken from other areas of her body in a bid to graft onto her face and torso.

At least two people were killed and up to 70 injured - 14 of them seriously - in the horror incident on a bridge near Bologna, Italy .  The powerful blast destroyed part of the bridge and ripped the tanker in two before the burning wreckage crashed onto several cars below. The moment it erupted near Bologna Airport was caught by a driver who had been filming the aftermath of the crash just a few metres away.  Plumes of thick black smoke can be seen coming from the crash site where several vehicles are backed-up nearby. Suddenly the tanker bursts into flames, with the impact shaking the car and leaving the driver clearly scared for their life as they jerk backwards in shock. The tanker erupted moments after crashing into a car transporter in Borgo Panigale at 2pm local time (1pm BST) in the north Italian region.  A massive plume of smoke was visible for miles as emergency services rushed to the scene to treat the injured and extinguish the inferno. After the tanker collapsed off the bridge the blaze spread to several cars that are believed to belong to Peugeot and Citroen. The vehicles then also exploded, smashing out windows and sending debris flying into passersby leaving several people hurt.

Nadia Revanale spent two days trapped under debris after the powerful quake killed at least 98 people, flattened villages and left tens of thousands of people homeless. Neighbours heard the 23-year-old\u0027s cries for help from the mangled concrete and alerted rescuers, who used their hands to clear debris in a desperate bid to reach her. It took four hours to free her from the rubble as the rescue on the island of Lombok provided a rare moment of joy for rescuers who are in a race against time after the second-deadliest quake of 2018.  Ms Revanale was shopping at the minimart in Pemenang when the earthquake hit on Sunday night and send terrified people running into the streets. She was rescued on Tuesday after spending two days trapped in the remains of the destroyed shop. After Ms Revanale was taken to hospital, Marcos Eric, a volunteer rescue worker from a mining company, told Reuters: First we used our hands to clear the debris, then hammers, chisels and machines to slowly remove the pieces.  It took many hours but we\u0027re thankful it worked and this person was found alive. Rescuers have been checking collapsed buildings in Lombok for signs of survivors, and there are fears the death toll will rise as rubble is cleared. Four people were trapped in the remains of a two-storey mosque in Pemenang, where rescuers were hopeful that at least one of them was still alive. A weak voice was heard coming from under a pile of bricks and mangled steel bars in the early hours of Tuesday.  Basarnas official Teddy Aditya said: We are looking for access. We have a machine that can drill or cut through concrete so we may use that. We are waiting for heavier equipment. More than 13,000 homes were flattened or badly damaged, meaning islanders have been forced to sleep outside in tents or under tarpaulins as they await rescue or aid. More than 20,000 people have been displaced and aid has been slow to reach some of them. Oxfam said it was providing clean drinking water and tarpaulin shelters to 5,000 survivors, but the needs were much greater.  It said: Thousands ... are under open skies in need of drinking water, food, medical supplies, and clothes. Clean drinking water is scarce due to the extremely dry weather conditions leading up the disaster. Thousands of tourists, including Brits, have left or are trying to leave Lombok, where the airport and ferry terminals were packed with people looking for a way out. Airlines have put on extra flights, but many holidaymakers remain stranded in places where food and water supplies have run out and electricity is spotty. More than 3,000 locals and tourists were extracted from the three Gili islands, off the north-west coast of Lombok, during a mass evacuation.

So does Matej and it’s been a good relationship.“Along with Neil Alexander, our coach, we have a goalie union and it is a fun working environment.“At the end of the day we all support each other and, whoever plays, that continues.“It’s good competition and it’s good for the team.“We prepare in training and whoever is picked, they will do their best. This is the life of a goalie really.”And he believes whoever is in the team, they will handle the rigours of a Scottish style of play that is, in some ways, a change from what they’ve been used to abroad but in many others just the same.“I haven’t really found the games here that different,” Siegrist added.“The continental game, if you like, is a little bit more passing and moving than here.“They play it long at times here and quicker than you would get overseas.“I will kick it long but also play the ball out from the back.“It is important when you do play it long it is to good areas where the strikers can use it as a weapon and not just kick the ball up to the stands.”For Siegrist, the most important thing going into today is United are now approaching the game with a degree of confidence.His feeling is the new-look line-up is ready for the all-important Championship action and he sees last week’s convincing Betfred Cup win at Elgin City as proof of that.“Obviously, the results were not always there in the cup but I think we have seen a lot of improvement from game one to the last game.“We wanted to win every game, each time you step on the pitch that competitive edge needs to come out, but I think we have seen a lot of improvement despite some of the results.“We understand now how the gaffer wants us to play.“It takes practice in training as well and, at the same time as playing these games, we had to practice for a long season ahead.“There are no excuses but there were some tired legs in the games because we worked hard from Monday to Friday and then we had a game on Saturday.“Everything has to come together and I thought in the last game, especially the second half against Elgin, we put everything together and did a good job.“The physical part was there, we didn’t get tired towards the end.“We had some fresh legs coming on in the second half, we played good football and we scored goals.“It was a good game to get some confidence from.“We are now going in on a high, we have prepared well this week and we will give it our all.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/Petra-Vujik.jpg ","title":"least friendly city for electric cars claim flattened by dundee development convener","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA claim that Dundee is one of the “least-friendly electric car” places in the UK has been rubbished by the council’s city development convener.Research by car price comparison site Motorway labelled Dundee the second worst town or city for viability for electric car ownership. The website looked at more than 100 locations and used the percentage of properties for sale with off-street parking – which provides an opportunity to install home charging points.It said just 50.4% had driveways or garages, just behind London’s 48.6%, while Poole in southern England came top with 91.9%.The Scottish Government has pledged to phase out new petrol and diesel cars and vans across Scotland by 2032, eight years ahead of the UK Government target, in a bid to reduce air pollution.Many drivers are expected to have charging points at home but public chargers will be needed for many motorists who live in flats and for drivers to use mid-journey.The council has made a big shift in recent years towards encouraging use of electric vehicles – particularly in the taxi industry.The new Princes Street charging hub, which opened last month, is used by almost 100 vehicles per day with some in the taxi industry describing it as the best in Scotland. There are more than 20 public charging posts in the city.Councillor Lynne Short, the council’s convener of city development, said the study failed to look at the bigger picture and added the city’s reliance on on-street parking is exactly why the authority is investing in public charging points. She said it was “ridiculous” to suggest the city is not electric car friendly.“They have looked at it in a very strange way.

We manufacture the chassis ourself, and fully design the car from the ground up.“Sometimes we might even use systems that we’ve designed as part of our course.“Things are held over, in terms of expensive components, but the whole design is fresh.”The team overcame a setback on its Aberdeenshire test track to take part in the competition, which took place between July 13 and 15. The day before the competition, during test laps, a wheel assembly collapsed, prompting the skeleton crew to replace it with one used on a previous car.Arran said: “It was a very tense atmosphere, we had a skeleton crew of about five or six there, and it took a really big push to get everything sorted.“It’s fair to say that they all did a great job.”Far from being an engineering-only event, Arran also spoke of how multi-faceted the competition is, with each team having to submit a business case, including costings to judges, as well as securing sponsors to cover the costs of the car.The mechanical engineering student said: “We have business students as part of the team, who are tasked with putting together a business case, as if we were going to mass produce the car.”Arran also mentioned the positive impact the team has on students.He said: “There’s a huge student development side.“Engineering students can apply theoretical knowledge that you learn in class on to the car, and you can learn other skills that you might not, like the manufacturing side.”Professor Igor Guz, head of the university’s school of engineering, said: “I am delighted that TAU Racing has achieved another great result in this year’s Formula Student competition. The result is a testament to the hard work and commitment of the team, and demonstrates the opportunities open to students when they come to study at one of the UK’s top universities for engineering.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/Ewan-Massie.jpg ","title":"delighted massie lifts worlds strongest title","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFraserburgh\u0026#8217s Ewan Massie is celebrating after lifting the world’s strongest man under 90kg crown.Scottish title-holder Massie, 24, travelled to Joensuu, Finland, at the weekend and defeated the international field to better his fourth and third-place finishes in 2017 and 2016.The full-time Edinburgh-based investment worker, who shared his moment of glory with his family and girlfriend, said: “I think it’s still sinking in.“I’m really glad I’ve won it and achieved my goal.“That’s the highest achievement I can get in U90kg strongman.“I don’t want to move up any weight classes and, because I’ve done it, I’m going to retire from international competitions.“I’ll still be involved in the sport, training and will coach my friends in the hope of getting a few more world’s strongest men from Scotland.”Massie’s varied prize for his victory included cash, an iPad, two trophies and a sword, which he said he hoped wouldn’t get stopped at the airport as he travelled back to work in the central belt today.The under 90kg category is strongman’s lightest, with heavier weight classes of under 105kg and the well-known, televised open class.In the early stages on Saturday, 23 competitors battled it out over three events – the frame carry, Viking press and box lifting – to decide the 12 finalists for Sunday’s final, with Massie cruising through in second position.The points from the first day carried into the final, meaning he started in a great position.Massie said: “The first event (of the final) was a Mercedes van deadlift, for maximum repetitions in 60 seconds.“I was in the last pair because it goes in reverse order, and I just went all out because I had in my mind I had to win that event to give me a good chance of winning the competition.“My hands were all torn up, but I just ignored the pain to lift it 17 times and win the event.“That put me in with a good chance.”Further performances holding a 25kg plate in front of him for as long as he could – Massie managed 40 seconds for fourth, as well as eighth place in the 280kg, 50-metre tyre drag – meant it all came down to the last event.In this final section, the sandbag carry, essentially a race to move four sandbags from one end of a track to another, Massie was in the second last pairing.He said: “I thought I’d maybe thrown my chances for the competition and the pressure was on for the final event – I had to win it to win the competition.“I was third overall going in, the same as last year. Last year I was a bit conservative because I didn’t want to make a mistake, so this year I zoned out, focused and lifted all the sandbags in the quickest time and won.“The first and second position pairing, the pressure got to them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"readers think matters us give us piece mind","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMaking assumptions about what our readers want is a risky way to make business decisions.

I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains.

A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine.

Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jenny celebrates 90 years","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 7:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowJenny Speirs of Inveraray recently celebrated her 90th birthday.She celebrated the milestone in style with a lunch party for family, friends and neighbours including cousins from Australia.Jenny thanks everyone for the lovely cards, flowers and gifts given to her during the celebrations.Donations in lieu of presents, at Jenny\u0026#8217s request, raised £300 for Cancer Research.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sheep and showers in high quality blackface show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 04/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA high quality show of sheep was held at Cairndow amid heavy showers interrupted by fiery sunshine.The annual Cowal Blackface Sheep Breeders\u0026#8217 Association show at Clachan \u0026#8211 right beside the Loch Fyne Oysters complex \u0026#8211 drew curious (if slightly bemused) tourists and seasoned hill shepherds in almost equal measure.The sheep show has, in recent years, been supported by a display of vintage tractors and other machinery, and this year Cowal Vintage Transport Club and Bute Vintage Club provided the gleaming hardware for visitors to enjoy.You can find pictures of the vintage machinery show on page 34.In the show ring, the overall champion came from Dyke Farm, Milton of Campsie, with a young ewe by £24,000 Elmscleugh out of a ewe by a son of Travis.The reserve overall was a ewe by Buffalo out of a dam by a £4,000 Midlock from Messrs MacPherson, Balliemeanoch, Loch Awe.In the section confined to the district of Cowal, the champion was from Pole Farm, Lochgoilhead, with a gimmer by Spectre out of a ewe by a £5,200 Allanfauld sire.The confined reserve champion \u0026#8211 and best sheep of the opposite sex to the overall champion \u0026#8211 was from Messrs Campbell, Drimsynie, Lochgoilhead, with a shearling tup by Allanfauld Pogba out of ewe by a 40k Nunnerie sire.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers.

This was a chance for villagers and visitors to get together to share food and drink, with musical entertainment from Paisley singer/songwriter Alan McKim.A wet start to Saturday July 28 failed to deter the enthusiasm of the crowds who converged on Tayvallich Village Hall for fun activities such as children’s sports, a bouncy castle and a pop-up crazy golf course that kept adults and children amused. The marquees provided shelter from the showers and a chance to browse the stalls.As well as classics like the bottle stall and guess the weight of the cake, there were representations from local businesses, voluntary groups and organisations, including the RNLI, Friends of the Sound of Jura, Heart of Argyll Wildlife and the 19th Argyll Scouts.After a break for lunch of paella, barbecue, sandwiches and home baking, the sun came out in time for the fabulous dog show, which featured novelty classes such as best six legs, fancy dress and the dog and handler race.Events moved into the hall on Saturday evening for the family ceilidh, where the fantastic Argyll Ceilidh Trail band kept the dancers on their feet into Sunday morning. The morning after, the focus moved to Tayvallich village pontoon for the world crab fishing championship.There are now 12 months of peace for people, pooches and partan until the next Tayvallich Weekend on July 26-28 next year.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soaked campbeltown cyclist raised charity cash","story":"\t\tMark DaveyUpdated: 06/08/18, 4:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA Campbeltown peddaller joined an Argyll peloton for this years RideLondon 100 event.The eight week London heat wave came to an abrupt end just in time for the  cycling quartet to take to the roads.Campbeltown cyclist Marjorie Leighton had enthused so much after taking part last year, that she encouraged three Mid Argyll friends Morag MacNicol, Catriona Crawford and Iain MacNicol to participate in this year\u0026#8217s challenge.The day before the event, the air temperature had soared to 32°C and the cyclists prepared for the possibilty of heat exhaustion.However on the day, they were shocked to find that they should have perhaps brought cyling capes instead.The persistent rain combined with the wind ensured that they were all soaked to the skin at the finish.The Argyll cyclists beat the target required for their chosen charity, Bloodwise (formerly Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research) which helps to fund research for specific types of cancer.This charity was selected, due to each of the participants having some experience with cancer.The cyclists said:\u0026#8217 We would like to thank all persons who have donated so far for this very worthwhile cause.\u0026#8217They have currently raised approximately £3,000 and will keep the JustGiving page open until the end of August should anyone wish to donate.  https://justgiving/fundraising/morag-macnicolFor more cycling news see pages 20 and 21.Marjorie Leighton, Morag MacNicol, Catriona Crawford and Iain MacNicol in Green Park.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

Yes dear readers, if all of the above was improbable – it might even have been amusing. But the demise and ultimate destruction of South Ayrshire’s busiest transport hub isn’t improbable – it’s inevitable. Last weekend, most of the United Kingdom was looking skywards for a glimpse of a “blood moon”. But on Saturday, I looked skywards as I walked across the Station Bridge . ... and all I saw was a bloody disgrace. Belts and straps have now been attached to Ayr Station Hotel’s chimney stacks in a bid to safely secure them. New areas at the Smith Street end of the station have been declared unsafe. The “no-go area” fencing that once cordoned a section of the front car park has been extended to barricade the entire building. If this was 1945, we could probably keep Rudolph Hess banged up in there! The harsh fact is that Ayr Station and its hotel have moved on from being a giant embarrassment to becoming the biggest threat to public safety, the local economy and the environment in South Ayrshire’s living memory. And what are South Ayrshire’s elected members doing about it? Er .... they’re all on their summer recess! On safety – is the Station Bridge REALLY safe for cars and pedestrians? A single lane was closed for “scaffolding work” – but it’s been scaffold-free for five weeks. If the gable-end chimneys need belts and buckles, is it prudent to allow the public to pass barely fifty yards below them? On the economy – I know my own business has been affected by the railway chaos. Many of my Ayr racecourse regulars by-passed the town centre and headed straight to the track from the station’s east side. And if I’m feeling it – God help the shops, bars, eateries and taxi drivers based around Smith Street and Burns Statue Square. On the environment – has anyone contemplated the dust, fumes and noise pollution that will surely come with demolishing a giant sandstone structure that’s visible from the Kilmarnock by-pass? MP Bill Grant was in my boozer last weekend – but on the first week of his hols, I extended the courtesy of letting him socialise with his friends. But I know he reads this page – and I hope he and MSP John Scott will be in agreement that two things must happen soon: 1) An Ayr Station Emergency Committee be set up involving all stakeholders – including structural and civil engineers, Scot Rail, South Ayrshire Council, road traffic management and local businesses. Its remit would be look at the entire station issue – and how best to fit all future works into the community. And if they can get Ayr Station Hotel’s owner to show up – a bit of public flogging wouldn’t go amiss either. 2) An independent investigation be set up to demand the facts from South Ayrshire Council on what they did – and didn’t do – as they watched an iconic town centre building fall into ruin right in front of them. And it has to be root and branch – every correspondence, every conversation, every e-mail – involving everyone from the Malaysian owners to our own Council executives and elected members. The council tax payers of South Ayrshire deserve the truth. And they certainly deserve better management of local resources than this current shambles .Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentTaxesAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic ban town square cumnock","story":"NewsTraffic ban in Town Square in CumnockFears over congestion in nearby roadsShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning10:05, 5 AUG 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailConcerns have been raised about traffic chaos when cars are banned from the Town Square in Cumnock. But vehicles needing access to Old Cumnock Old Church for weddings or funerals will continue to have access. These vehicles will have to show a permit to access The Square. Any other vehicles will be hit by a fixed-penalty notice if they flout the new traffic regulations. The move is designed to improve safety to pedestrians and cyclists in the Square. One community councillor said it would stop parking outside the hairdressers and takeaways at the Square: “Traffic in the Square will be limited,” he added. “From the beginning of August anyone driving a car would need to have a permit. “It will be limited to funeral cars, wedding cars for church services “The main thing is they are going to block off pedestrian crossing outside the Royal Hotel. “So the cars are going to have to come in and go back out into Lugar Street. “It is going to be mayhem in Lugar Street. “I suggested reversing the one way system at Hamilton Place and make it street pedestrian only.” Another community councillor asked how it would be implemented. He added: “Who is going to patrol it? “Will it be police or traffic wardens. “I haven’t seen police in the square.” Stewart Turner, head of road at Ayrshire Roads Alliance, said: “Access to The Square will be limited to vehicles directly associated with wedding and funeral operations at Old Cumnock Old Church. “These vehicles will be required to display a permit to access The Square. Permits are available free of charge from the Ayrshire Roads Alliance. “We have contacted several wedding and funeral operators in the immediate area and advised of this requirement. “Exemptions to the access restriction include vehicles engaged in building work, road repairs, utility repairs, postal delivery, cash collection, furniture removal operations and the emergency services. “The Square will also have waiting and loading restrictions in force at all times. This will enable a Parking Attendant employed by the Council to issue a Penalty Charge Notice to any vehicle within The Square contravening the restrictions.  “Exemptions to the waiting  and loading restrictions are exactly the same as the access restriction.  “I do not anticipate traffic congestion on Lugar Street as a result of this Order. “The Order was promoted to prevent danger to pedestrians and cyclists in The Square. “The Order was advertised on Wednesday March 28 and received no objections. “The Order is fully supported by Police Scotland and they will be responsible for enforcing the restrictions.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPolice ScotlandCumnockAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"watch-moment-scottish-borders-mum-is-struck-by-lightning-while-filming-in-galashiels","story":"A GALASHIELS mum feared she was going to die after being \u0027stuck by lightning\u0027.\nTracey Kutluol captured the moment on her phone from a\u0026nbspwindow when she was \u0027struck\u0027\u0026nbspat around 10pm on Thursday night.\nIn the video, which has had over 25,000 views since it was posted to Facebook, Tracey opens the window and says: \"I think I\u0027m going to get electrocuted.\"\nDespite pleas from her children not to film with the window open, Tracey reassuring them\u0026nbspsaying \"It\u0027s fine\" before being \u0027struck\u0027 just seconds later.\nThe mum-of-two\u0026nbspcan then be heard saying: \"I\u0027ve just been struck by lightning, I\u0027ve just got struck, my phone blew.\"\nFollowing the video, Tracey took to Facebook, posting:\u0026nbsp\"Learned my lesson...don\u0026rsquot play with nature.\"\nShe added: \"Told them [her children] all to\u0026nbspgo downstairs to my room while I switched everything off...no damage done just really shaken up.\"\nAnd things could have been much worse if it wasn\u0027t for one thing.\n\"We\u0026rsquore all ok thank goodness.

We are very close but it won\u0026rsquot happen at all unless we reach the \u0026pound70,000 target with this final fundraising push.\nThe redevelopment will see all of the seating in the auditorium replaced or repositioned to increase space and improve the sightlines from the balconies, as well as installing new hand grabs on the aisle seats and improving the heating and ventilation systems.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"biking-bonanza-coming-to-traquair","story":"VISITORS to the Beyond Borders International Festival at Traquair House next month will be able to take part in free guided bike rides.\nLocal resident Andrew Marchant will be teaming up with authors and avid cyclists Kate Rawles, Peter Walker and Will Manners to lead a series of rides through the local countryside.\nFestival goers will be welcome to bring their own or simply hop on one of the hire bikes that will be available free of charge.\nAlong the stunning routes in the surrounding area, cyclists will listen and share a wealth of cycling knowledge with Andrew, Kate, Will and Peter.

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work. Miss Jane Fergusson executed some remarkable wood carvings in St Andrew\u0026rsquos church and was instrumental in forming a local branch of the Band of Mercy.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-actor-lands-starring-role-in-theatre-royal-programme","story":"ACTORS from across the UK applied in their hundreds for the highly-regarded Theatre Royal education programme.\nAnd following a demanding audition process, one budding thespian from Melrose landed one of the 18 starring roles.\nAlexander Cowan will now embark on a year-long course of mentoring by top industry professionals, which in the past has included Royal Shakespeare Company voice coach Michael Corbridge and Ros Steen, the former head of vocal training at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.\nSome of the acting world\u0026rsquos most famous names have trodden the boards at Newcastle\u0027s Theatre Royal including Dame Judy Dench and Sirs Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart.\nAlexander is delighted to be joining them.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

This year it was reprinted by Comely Bank Publishing as Russain Doll.In a strange synchronicity, at virtually the same time as last week’s talk, former SNP leader and MP Alex Salmond, who now broadcasts for Russian television, was dumped as a potential chairman by the investor trying to takeover Johnston Press.Drawing on her own seven years BBC radio experience, Ms Lloyd’s heroine, Anna, is a radio producer at the Scottish Broadcasting Corporation as it has been renamed after independence.The book’s blurb states: ‘In an independent Scotland, Russia attempts a soft occupation under the noses of the novice government.‘Against her best intentions, she finds herself falling for a Russian diplomat tasked with delivering Scotland into Moscow’s hands.‘As war looms, will this relationship save, or destroy, Anna?’Ms Lloyd, a scientist, runner and skier says she was on the river or pitch more than in a lab.This description fits Anna who is often described as ‘out for a run’ and Ms Lloyd says is: ‘Feisty, smart, sporty and spouting opinions.’‘When I wrote the book, the Brexit vote had not happened and Donald Trump was a bad television games show host,’ said Ms Lloyd. ‘It was written before the concept of fake news.‘It is more of a love story than a political novel. I remembered looking at photos from when Paris was liberated in 1945 after the German occupation and wondering what happened to the collaborators.‘It is written in a post-independence parallel world, so much has happened since 2014.‘Russia presents an amazing enigma of tremendous wealth but is their relationship with the West more about posturing?’One member of the dozen who attended the talk asked: ‘Do you think Scots would prefer Euros to Roubles?’Ms Lloyd said she glossed over the question of Europe but did imagine that Scotland would have to renegotiate its seat at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.Ms Lloyd is working on a second book and said: ‘I have young children so I can indulge myself.’Russian Doll is available for £9.99 from Amazon and booksellers or direct from the author, who also sells a natty line in sports socks.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter sea photos wanted","story":"Photographers across the UK have just two weeks to enter their best images of the sea in an annual photography competition run by national maritime charity, the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society.The competition, which closes on Monday, August 13, encourages amateur and professional photographers to submit pictures that best encapsulate Britain’s enduring connection with the sea.It celebrates the nation’s proud maritime heritage and our reliance on seafarers.The competition’s prestigious judging panel includes experts from the Sunday Times, the I, and Amateur Photographer Magazine, alongside the charity’s chief executive, Captain Justin Osmond.The overall winner of the competition will be presented with a voucher for photographic equipment.The Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society provides financial assistance to fishermen, mariners and their dependants who are suffering hardship, whether due to accident, ill health, unemployment or in retirement after a life spent working at sea.In the last year the charity received 560 new applications for assistance and distributed £1.4 million in more than 2,000 cases of need.To enter the competition go to: www.shipwreckedmariners.org.uk or  www.facebook/shipwreckedmariners and @ShipwreckedSoc.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lotto draws 4","story":"The draw for Dunaverty\u0026#8217s three number lotto was made on July 19.The winning numbers were five, seven and 17.There were no winners and the next draw for a jackpot of £200 will be held on August 12.Tickets are available from committee members, the club steward, Muneroy tearooms and the Burnside bar.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"caledonia way cycling companion guidebook","story":"A comprehensive pedaling plan to the cycle route from Campbeltown to Inverness was published last week.The 118 page handlebar bag sized spiral bound book, to guide cyclists on National Cycle Route 78, is so far available at Machrihanish Holiday Park, Patersons Bakery Carradale, Skipness Smokehouse and Argyll Backpackers at Inverneil.Independent publishers, The Offcomers \u0026#8211 Janet Moss and Pete Martin, visited Campbeltown last Thursday, from their Cumbria base, to launch the book\u0026#8217s first edition.It was the pair\u0026#8217s second visit since May when they put finishing touches to the production which started about 18 months ago.Mr Martin said: \u0026#8216The Caledonia Way covers some of Scotland\u0026#8217s best scenery with plenty of emptiness.\u0026#8216The guide has full listing sections including complete Ordnance Survey maps of each section, a comprehensive accommodation guide and locations where cycle spares might be found.\u0026#8216We have cycled the route at least once in both directions although much of the research has been during the winter months.\u0026#8216Some of the toughest bits of the route are between Campbeltown and Oban.\u0026#8217The route is split into six sections and includes fully Ordnance Survey maps detailing each day\u0026#8217s ride.Travel to Campbeltown is more complicated than to Inverness, for the bike borne tourist, but the Offcomers suggest the ferry as a good option particularly as the fare is £7.90 and the bike goes free.Apart from some slight niggles, such as the second line, describing Campbeltown as being at the southern end of the Kintyre Peninsular (sic), it is a fine guide to the route.There are ominous omissions in the accommodation listing and places to eat. For instance in Campbeltown Amelias, Food for Thought and Ceann Loch Diner are excluded.Neither of Campbeltown\u0026#8217s fish and chip shops are included, either in the listings or on the map, despite there being a map symbol for those takeaways.Many cyclists are inquisitive and will no doubt discover other options as the guide is just a starting point.The Caledonia Way may also appeal to motorised travellers as well as the self propelled.A separate concertina trip planner leaflet, inserted at the back of the book, shows a height cross section of the full route and is cross referenced to the accommodation providers.On the reverse of this route planner is a diagrammatic map, trip planning tool and mileage chart including a speech bubble stating: \u0026#8216Are there any more hills today.\u0026#8217The Offcomers \u0026#8211 Pete Martin and Janet Moss with their guidebook at the Campbeltown launch. 25_c31caledonia01_PeteMartin_Janet_Moss\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane august 3 2018","story":"In the days before rapid transatlantic flights, The Royal Mail Ship (RMS) Queen Elizabeth operated a weekly luxury liner service between Southampton and New York.A phone call, to the Southampton ferry and tug company Red Funnel, started a huge and challenging recovery exercise to refloat the 83,000 ton liner from the Bramble Bank.Tugs Canute, Clausentum, Neptune and Vulcan and Alexandra Towing Company\u0026#8217s Romey, Hornby and Poulsom were sent but soon it was realised more would be needed.Last week down memory lane featured the Royal Navy tug HMRT Bustler, a model of which is in Campbeltown museum.

More than six in 10 claim to have kept at least one of the postcards they’ve received over the years.’A spokesperson for Lyrical Scotland, which produces Mr McMillan\u0026#8217s best selling card, said: \u0026#8216Similarly to Royal Mail, we have seen a steady increase in our postcard sales to retailers, which we attribute to refreshing and modernizing our designs and images.\u0026#8216We continue to focus on both popular places of interest and the more unusual and interesting views and vistas of Scotland.\u0026#8217Michael McGregor is a photographer and postcard printer, based at Ardnamurchan and said that the days when he used to print a million cards a year are long gone.Mr MacGregor added: \u0026#8216However, many of the big players have left the market leaving us specialists.\u0026#8216If they are unusual of striking images tourists will often buy cards, not to post but to remember their trips.\u0026#8216We have a herd of Highland cattle and they are certainly cash cows for featuring in many postcards.\u0026#8217In 2001, before 9/11, one of Mr MacGregor\u0026#8217s cards was sent to a banker at Morgan Stanley.  It was found among the wreckage of the World Trade Centre\u0026#8217s twin towers and posted back to Ardnamurchan by a New York fireman.Andrew Wallace, 21, is a sales assistant in Cadenhead\u0026#8217s Whiskey Shop, he had an opposing view on postcards.He said: \u0026#8216We do not sell many postcards, I think that this is because people are using social media instead\u0026#8217.He also admitted: \u0026#8216I have never sent a postcard, it\u0026#8217s a thing of the past and we are heading into a paperless world.\u0026#8216I think that this may be a good thing.\u0026#8217When asked about his view on the future demand of postcards, and if he believes that more people should purchase them, Mr McMillan laughed and said: \u0026#8216They certainly should because I\u0026#8217d make more money.\u0026#8217All postcard images are used with permission of the copyright holders.George McMillan\u0026#8217s best selling card.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.

Earlier this month it was claimed on social media that young female players had been subjected to harassment from males as they trained at the park however, no formal complaints about any incident have been made to the council or police.  A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWhile we are aware of vandalism issues, we have not been made aware of allegations of female players being harassed during training. If this is the case it would obviously be of concern so we will look into this as a matter of urgency.  Police Scotland said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been made aware of a number of incidents which have taken place in the Foresters Park area of Tranent recently, including vandalisms to the football pitch and break-ins to a catering facility.  \u0026ldquoThis behaviour is completely unacceptable and local officers are committed to working with East Lothian Council and enjoyleisure to prevent further incidents and deter anti-social behaviour.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company had also contacted Prestonpans Community Council about its plans, with the former Cockenzie Power Station site seen as a possible home for the work.  It has also been suggested that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

It has scorched 283,800 acres (443.4 sq m), fire officials said on Monday.  The fires, north of San Francisco, have burned 75 homes and is only 30% contained.  The size of the fires surpasses a blaze last December in Southern California that burned 281,893 acres (440.5 sq m). It killed two people, including a firefighter, and destroyed more than 1,000 buildings before being fully contained on January 12.  Hotter weather attributed to climate change is drying out vegetation, creating more intense fires that spread quickly from rural areas to city subdivisions, climate and fire experts say.  But they also blame cities and towns that are expanding housing into previously undeveloped areas.  More than 14,000 firefighters are battling over a dozen major blazes throughout California, state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean said.  \u0026ldquoI can remember a couple of years ago when we saw 10 to 12,000 firefighters in the states of California, Oregon and Washington and never the 14,000 we see now, he said.  Crews did make progress over the weekend against one of the two blazes in the Mendocino Complex with help from water-dropping aircraft, Cal Fire operations chief Charlie Blankenheim said.  But the other one is growing after spreading into the Mendocino National Forest.  The complex of fire has been less destructive to property than some of the other wildfires in the state because it is mostly raging in remote areas.  But officials say the twin fires threaten 11,300 buildings and some new evacuations were ordered over the weekend as the flames spread.          #WagnerFire [update] at Texas Hill Rd and Bondurant Mine Rd, east of Coulterville (Mariposa County) is now 22 acres and 98% contained. pic.twitter/MPTeG0ex5r          \u0026mdash CAL FIRE (@CAL_FIRE) August 7, 2018  Farther north, crews gained ground against a deadly blaze that has destroyed more than 1,000 homes in and around Redding. It was nearly halfway contained, Cal Fire said.  The wildfire about 225 miles north of San Francisco started more than two weeks ago by sparks from the steel wheel of a towed-trailer\u0026rsquos flat tyre. It killed two firefighters and four residents and displaced more than 38,000 people.  Officials began allowing some residents to return to their neighbourhoods. But tens of thousands of others were still evacuated.  The fires in northern California have created such a haze of smoke in the Central Valley that Sacramento County health officials advised residents to avoid outdoor activities for the entire week.          #CarrFire now covers more than 160,000 acres and is 43 percent contained.

Ofgem also said it was working on a price cap for another 11 million households on \u0026ldquopoor value tariffs, with the measures due to be in place by the end of the year.  Ofgem adjusts the level of the tariff twice a year based on a method set by the Competition and Markets Authority.  The rise comes after a series of price hikes from the energy companies over the summer, affecting millions of households.  E.ON, British Gas, SSE, Npower, EDF, ScottishPower and Bulb have all hiked energy prices, blaming wholesale energy costs for the increases.  Consumer groups have warned energy customers about the rising tariffs, saying they should switch to a better deal.  Consumer watchdog Which? has estimated that customers who do not seek out the best deals could end up overpaying by as much as \u0026pound400 per year.  The Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Bill will put in place a requirement on Ofgem to cap standard variable and default energy tariffs until at least 2020 to tackle the amount consumers have been overpaying the Big Six energy suppliers.  The Bill enables the temporary price cap to remain in place until 2023 if conditions for effective market competition are not met."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8170393.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"sea-life-thriving-at-underwater-mausoleum-off-us-coast","story":"  A year after Will and Daniel Payne lost their mother and nearly two decades since their father\u0026rsquos death, they have helped their dying wishes come true.  Three generations of family members were present as the\u0026nbspbrothers slipped into flippers and de-fog their masks off Miami Beach.  Will Payne, who became a certified scuba diver just days earlier, checked his oxygen tank and jumped into the waters to secure a concrete marker mixed with their ashes at a memorial reef about three miles out to sea.  This unusual resting place is exactly what the Paynes say their parents wanted.  Buel Payne, a former Coast Guard member, and Linda Payne, who grew up on the water and loved boating, will spend their afterlife in a memorial modelled after the lost city of Atlantis.  Their ashes will be among lion statues and ornate gates and pillars that are encrusted with sea life.  It took nearly four years for multiple government agencies to sign off on this underwater mausoleum, which is designed to encourage a healthy ecosystem.  Roughly a decade later, the Neptune Memorial Reef is home to the cremated remains of 1,500 people, and any snorkeller or scuba diver can visit.  The Paynes are the first to be memorialised in the reef\u0026rsquos expansion, which opened this summer and will make room for an additional 4,000 memorials over 16 acres, about 40 feet deep.  Placements start at around 1,500 US dollars and can go up to 8,000 dollars, with the priciest placements for specialised shapes like sea turtles and stingrays or for prominent spots throughout the city like the lions.  With reefs struggling worldwide against coral bleaching and other threats, the memorial\u0026rsquos builders are providing coral a head start.  The concrete structures offer a high pH level, enabling sea creatures to flourish.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore seeing animals here that we haven\u0026rsquot seen before. Ones that have been missing for a long time, says Jim Hutslar, the reef\u0026rsquos operations director and one of the founders.  \u0026ldquoWe actually found a long spine sea urchin that was considered extinct in the Caribbean Sea.  Sara Thanner, an environmental supervisor for the Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources, says an April survey showed the reef supports more than 65 different fish, shrimp and lobster and 75 other species including sponges, soft corals, and hard corals.  For people making end-of-life plans, the reef means being part of something living.  Mr Hutslar is hoping that decades from now, the memorial will have grown into a massive coral reef where individual markers will no longer be distinguishable, and \u0026ldquofamily members will just know their loved ones are part of it.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore creating life after life, he said.  While Mr Hutslar, Will Payne and another diver descended to the ocean floor, Daniel and his wife and three children snorkelled on the surface, gazing down through the strong clear currents.  They spotted a parrot fish, barracuda and a monster snook while abundant schools of small, colourful fish darted in and out of the sculptures.  They had picked out a small bronze headstone reading Together At Last to mark the ashes, adding their thumbprints on a decorative concrete sea shell.  The divers picked a spot amid the underwater city\u0026rsquos striking columns and statues.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos just amazing. It\u0026rsquos so peaceful, Will Payne said.  \u0026ldquoIf there is a heaven, that would be it for them.  Back on the boat, the family ate biscuits and oranges and enjoyed a day at sea, laughing, hugging and crying at times.  The men\u0026rsquos aunt and uncle also brought red roses that each member of the family tossed overboard.  Daniel Payne, 41, said he plans to get scuba-certified so he can see it up close, and return every year.  \u0026ldquoI really didn\u0026rsquot get it when (my mom) was telling me about it and the more and more I think about it, it\u0026rsquos really a nice, peaceful spot for your last resting place, he said.  Mr Hutslar and his partners were solely focused on supporting marine life at first, figuring the cemetery would help pay for the reef.  But he has helped hundreds of families say goodbye to their loved ones over the years, giving him a calling he has come to cherish.  \u0026ldquoThis has actually become my favourite part \u0026mdash being with the families, said Mr Hutslar.  Memorials for children especially stick in his mind.  There is something healing about the ocean.  He says you can see it when families return to the surface.  \u0026ldquoYou can watch something wash away, he said.  It happened again, Mr Hutslar said, as Will Payne paid his final respects.  \u0026ldquoI hope you\u0026rsquore happy where you\u0026rsquore at. I love you, Will Payne whispered through his mouthpiece.  \u0026ldquoKeep an eye on us."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7677862.jpg?htype=108\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glasgow-2018-cycling-event-workers-advised-to-stay-at-home","story":"  Europe\u0026rsquos elite cyclists will take part in the Men\u0026rsquos and Women\u0026rsquos Cycling Time Trial events on Wednesday, August 8.

He said: \u0026ldquoI started my own business at 21 and have now been running Recruitment Scotland for almost two years.  \"Taking the leap has been the best decision I have ever made in my life.\"  DYW Glasgow is asking people to post a photograph of their own path on social media today using the hashtag #NoWrongPath and tagging @DYWglasgow, holding a sign with their name, what they did when they left school and what they are doing now.  The campaign garnered support from many well-known faces last year including musician KT Tunstall, politician Iain Gray and comedian Fred MacAuley, and went on to win a Herald Digital Award.  Some 135,000 Scottish school pupils will receive exam results from SQA on 7 August via email, text and post.

Sporting triumphs included thousands of fans cheering as the women\u0026rsquos road cycling event sped around the city\u0026rsquos streets on Sunday, with the gold going to Italy\u0026rsquos Marta Bastianelli.  Glasgow 2018 Championships director Colin Hartley said: \u0026ldquoThe incredible sporting endeavours combined with the carnival atmosphere has proven to be an overwhelming hit with visitors and residents.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod like to thank all of our visitors \u0026ndash and residents \u0026ndash for helping to make the first weekend of the championships such an outstanding success.  Yesterday, Team Great Britain took home a further five medals despite 200m breaststroke star Ross Murdoch finishing in fourth place.  Swimming stars Adam Peaty, Nick Pyle, Charlotte Atkinson and Freya Anderson received gold for the mixed 4x100m medley relay while James Wilby won silver in men\u0026rsquos 200m breaststroke.  In track cycling, Ethan Hayter and Oliver Wood nabbed bronze in men\u0026rsquos madison.  Alys Thomas and Max Litchfield both also took him third place medals in the women\u0026rsquos 200m butterfly and men\u0026rsquos 200m individual medley respectfully. But the team took a hit yesterday, when it was confirmed athletics captain Dai Greene was ruled out after his injury curse struck again.  The 2011 world champion, who is back in the squad for the first time since 2013, suffered a tight hamstring in the warm-up for the 400 metres hurdles heats on Monday.  He was seen limping away from the Olympic Stadium in Berlin to end his hopes of a remarkable revival in Germany.  A statement from British Athletics read: \u0026ldquoGreat Britain and Northern Ireland team captain Dai Greene has sadly been forced to withdraw from today\u0026rsquos qualifying round of the men\u0026rsquos 400m hurdles after his hamstring tightened during warm up causing him difficulty hurdling.  On the first afternoon of competition \u0026ndash which consisted of qualifiers \u0026ndash Daryll Neita reached the women\u0026rsquos 100m semi-final on Tuesday after running 11.48 seconds in her heat, qualifying as a fastest loser.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos all that matters [reaching the semi-final]. I\u0026rsquove made it hard for myself now but I have got to fix it up, she said.  Commonwealth champion Nick Miller reached the hammer final after a throw of 73.79m but Chris Bennett missed out while Sebastian Roger failed to progress from the 400m hurdles heats.  Dan Bramble qualified in fifth for the long jump final with a leap of 7.89m but Feron Sayers finished 15th with only the top 12 qualifying.  Today, Zharnel Hughes, Reece Prescod and CJ Ujah are aiming for the 100m title while Dina Asher-Smith is hunting the women\u0026rsquos crown.  Great Britain\u0026rsquos Olympic champion Jack Laugher begins his games campaign in the men\u0026rsquos 1m springboard at the Royal Commonwealth Pool this afternoon.  Laugher, who proved his form at the Commonwealth Games earlier this year by winning three gold medals, is the favourite but needs to watch out for \u0026ldquoold hand Patrick Hausding of Germany, who has 14 European titles to his name, world bronze medallist Giovanni Tocci from Italy and and Ukraine\u0026rsquos Oleg Kolodiy.  Meanwhile, the inaugural European Golf Team Championships at Gleneagles sees the return of live UK golf to free-to-air TV.  The Championships, which will comprise men\u0026rsquos and women\u0026rsquos team events as well as a mixed team format, will be screened live across the BBC network in addition to significant radio and online coverage.  Fronted by Eilidh Barbour, the BBC\u0026rsquos golf coverage from Gleneagles will see live action across Friday, Saturday and Sunday with highlights from the first two days of play. Callum Shinkwin and Lee Slattery will make up the first Team GB duo to take on the task, while Georgia Hall and Laura Davies will compete in the women\u0026rsquos competition.  Later in the week, road cycling returns, with time trials on Wednesday and the men\u0026rsquos race on Sunday.  Alongside the sporting achievements, the Festival 2018 cultural programme has captured the imagination, with hundreds of people taking part in a carnival procession on Saturday.  More than 700 marched between George Square and Glasgow Green, where have-a-go sports are on offer.  Other events included a mass ceilidh and concert in George Square.  TODAY\u0027S HIGHLIGHTS  Swimming at Tollcross Swimming Centre \u0026ndash Finals from 4.30pm - 6pm\u0026nbsp  Six gold events will take place at the East End venue today, including the 50m Butterfly men\u0026rsquos final, 100m women\u0026rsquos backstroke and four x 200m women\u0026rsquos freestyle relay. Teenager Jacob Peters is looking to make his mark for Team GB in the butterfly final.

Bus services between Glasgow City Centre and Glasgow Green are expected to be busier today, especially into the evening.  While routes surrounding Tollcross Road and Shettleston Road will also be busier before 9am and after 12pm due to swimming events in the area.  Closures will surround junction 15 westbound of the M8 and drivers have been advised to avoid the area if possible.  However, the entire motorway is expected to be overloaded with traffic during the time trial events which are taking place across the city.  Congestion is expected around key routes in the west of Glasgow, including the Clydeside Expressway, as well as the area surrounding Cathkin Braes Country Park due to a number of parking restrictions.  Both Ardencraig Road and B759 Cathkin Roads are also expected to be busier than normal. The advice from games organisers is to work from home if possible, while those who must venture out into the city have been told to avoid routes which are expected to experience congestion.  Two mountain biking trials, a cycling final, two swimming and a further two synchronised swimming events all taking place at various points across the city are among the reasons for the road disruption.

Hundreds lined streets to cheer on riders for the women\u0027s road race which wound its way through several major residential areas and various Glasgow landmarks like Kelvingrove Museum and George Square.  And residents were warned to expect some disruption this week as the Games take over the city.  Diversions were the order of the day for Sunday\u0027s race, and parts of Glasgow ended up gridlocked for the race.    But the Very Rev Kelvin Holdsworth, a prominent clergyman in the Scottish Episcopal Church, the Church of England\u0026rsquos sister institution was among those who were less than impressed.  The provost who runs St Mary\u0026rsquos Cathedral in Glasgow, said: \"I don\u0027t have any objection to people going cycling.

And a city council spokesman added: \u0026ldquoA major event such as the cycling races during the European Championships will inevitably involve some road closures to both allow the racing to take place and to allow fans of the sport the opportunity to see some of the finest riders on the continent on the city\u0026rsquos streets. \"The road closures were published by the event organisers in advance of the racing to advise road users of changes during the championships.

In the end Italian Marta Bastianelli won a sprint finish with Marianne Vos to strike gold in the road race.

The 64-year-old was a postgraduate student at Glasgow University when his family was torn apart just months after Hussein came to power in 1979.  They were among countless Iraqi citizens deported to Iran, while his older brother Jamal was held hostage with 11 of his cousins and sent to the infamous Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. He was last seen in 1984.  Over the years that followed, Mr Ketuly collected crucial evidence of the atrocities committed by the dictator, adding to the charges which eventually led to Hussein\u0026rsquos execution in 2006.  He also helped journalists \u0026ndash including from The Herald \u0026ndash enter Iraq to report on the violence and upheaval within its borders.  His presidential bid comes amid the continuing fallout from May\u0026rsquos parliamentary elections, which were marred by allegations of widespread fraud.  Mr Ketuly hopes his position as an outside, independent candidate will garner support from Iraq\u0026rsquos divided politicians and parties, as well as demonstrators calling for change.  He said: \u0026ldquoSo far, I am the only registered candidate. If I win the presidency, I want to bring together all of the divergent ethnic and religious groups and political factions to develop Iraq socially, scientifically and economically, in order to see the country flourish.  \u0026ldquoIraq has struggled for too long and the time has come to restore peace, stability and unity for the benefit of the nation\u0026rsquos 37 million citizens.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe want to get the image of Iraq cleaned and let people see the real Iraq, building relationships with outside powers and opening up Iraq to the world.  Mr Ketuly splits his time between Glasgow\u0026rsquos Ruchill area and Iraq, where he lectures at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Duhok.  He worked at Glasgow University until the early 1990s, and sought asylum in the city when his family was deported and their possessions seized.  An Iraqi Kurd born in Baghdad, he has already been in contact with the country\u0026rsquos Kurdish parties, which are split into two different factions and have yet to put forward any candidate.  The academic said he will push for \u0026ldquopeace and stability if his bid is successful, while attempting to reverse the destruction caused by decades of war and upheaval.  As well as mass rebuilding, he wants to secure better environmental protection and improve the use of water and energy resources \u0026ndash including by constructing solar panel fields in the deserts of western Iraq.  While estimating he has a slim chance of success, Mr Ketuly added: \u0026ldquoWhen the new Iraqi parliament starts, we have a petition for the new MPs to see what kind of support they would give somebody like me. I will go and speak to the various MPs in the Iraqi parliament to see how they will feel.  Iraq\u0027s elections earlier this year were won by an alliance led by Moqtada al-Sadr, a Shia cleric who previously came to prominence after leading violent uprisings against US troops.  Mr Ketuly\u0027s bid comes after Hassan Rouhani, who was a postgraduate student at Glasgow Caledonian University in the 1990s, was elected president of neighbouring Iran in 2013.  Mr Rouhani, who even included Glasgow Caledonian in his election campaign video, recently hit the news after invoking the ire of US President Donald Trump when he warned: \"America should know peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars.  Yesterday, the UK and EU partners said they would move to block Mr Trump\u0026rsquos decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran in order to preserve peace."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8169020.jpg?type=article-full","title":"poorest-scots-families-locked-out-of-jobs-market-by-unaffordable-and-unreliable-local-transport","story":"  That\u0027s the view of a new report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which examined issues for the unemployed in Port Glasgow and Castlemilk and revealed that the accessibility of key areas of employment using public transport is often \"very restricted\".  The researchers said that the \"unreliability\" of local buses is at risk of creating new \u0026lsquocut-off commuter zones\u0026rsquo where people are unable to consistently guarantee punctuality when travelling longer distances for work.  This \"serious disconnect\" between the location of jobs and low-income neighbourhoods was \"constraining people\u0026rsquos ability to seize job opportunities when they arise\", according to the report.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspOne million missing out due to poor transport links  They called on the Scottish Government, local authorities and transport bodies to act to ensure bus franchising powers are used to \"improve the availability, affordability and reliability of services, to make it easier for people on low incomes to access employment\".  They said the planning process should be improved to ensure new housing and employment developments are well served by public transport.  They said that Port Glasgow ought to be well connected to the wider city region, given the range of potential transport modes available, including bus and rail.  But the study observed that \"significant portions\" of the city region are more than an hour away by public transport, including much of Glasgow.    While Castlemilk was around five-and-a-half miles to Glasgow city centre and would take typically around 30 minutes at 8am in a car, the journey takes around 45 minutes by public transport but, but that is if services run on time.  The study conducted by Sheffield Hallam University and the University of Sheffield said transport was consistently highlighted as a significant barrier to work once the trade-off between the cost, reliability and speed of local public transport and the prospect of low-wage, insecure work was considered.  For many low-income families the cost of purchasing and then running their own car was not affordable and makes them fully reliant on public transport.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspPoor services for bus users in national park  The study said concerns were raised that due to the \"insecure and competitive nature\" of the jobs, residents were going for, \"poor productivity caused by delays that could easily result in a reduction of their hours or being let go\".  One 61-year-old Port Glasgow resident told researchers he had to give up a job as a security guard on an industrial estate on the outskirts of Paisley because of a combination of transport issues and job insecurity. The commute involved catching a bus from his house to Port Glasgow railway station to get the train to Paisley, followed by a bus ride to his place of work for a 12-hour shift between 5pm and 5am.  The journey usually took over an hour each way but delays could significantly lengthen his commute and long working day.  \"I was leaving the house at half three [in the afternoon] and I wasn\u0026rsquot getting home the next morning till eight [in the morning], then get four hours sleep and get back up and go back again,\" he said.  A 48-year-old woman from Castlemilk added: \"It could be a nightmare. If a bus doesn\u0027t turn up, you could get the sack. It affects the house and everything. I hate being late. It puts me off changing [buses]. Employers expect you to be there nine to five. If you\u0027re not, it\u0027s like, \u0027Right, out the door!\u0027\"    Brian Robson, acting head of policy and research at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos unacceptable that large numbers of people seeking work are being locked out of job opportunities simply because of poor public transport connections. The experiences of low-income residents make it abundantly clear that we must properly invest in transport networks within cities not just between them.  \u0026ldquoCurrently unaffordable and unreliable public transport is holding people back from being able to achieve a better standard of living. With more powers being devolved to city and local leaders, now is the time to redesign our transport, housing and economic policies so that everyone can get into work and progress in their careers.  A Transport Scotland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to supporting services and tackling the historic decline in bus passenger numbers. The Transport (Scotland) Bill will support local authorities to meet local needs, whether they wish to pursue partnership working, local franchising, or running their own buses where appropriate. \u0026nbspLocal authorities can already run their own services in some limited circumstances, as some do. The Bill extends these powers.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government is investing up to \u0026pound96m in Fair Start Scotland, a new devolved employability support service to help people find work. As a voluntary and inclusive service, Fair Start Scotland aims to help 38,000 unemployed people in Scotland to find sustainable jobs, including people who are further from the labour market. \u0026nbspFair Start Scotland participants receive tailored support taking into account their personal circumstances to remove barriers to accessing employment.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoWe are currently undertaking a review of the National Transport Strategy, which will consider our long-term approach to ensuring the affordability of transport across Scotland.\"\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-testing-times-for-those-who-aim-to-widen-university-access","story":"  Following Newton\u0026rsquos Third Law, Tim Bradshaw of the Russell Group called on the Government to make more money available, rather than \u0026ldquoputting all the blame on universities. His suggestion for widening access was maintenance grants, rather than loans, for the poorest students.  There\u0026rsquos a sort of economic law at work here, too. The customer demands results (in this case, better access for poorer students) as a return on payment, while the provider says the desired result can\u0026rsquot be achieved for that cost.  The differences in university funding across the UK complicated matters. The Scottish Government is committed (until Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos taxpayer-funded rock outside Heriot-Watt University melts with the sun) to paying tuition fees for Scottish students and must thus do the same for EU students, unless they are English. For, you know, reasons.  That money comes from taxpayers, including non-graduates. In practice, the English loan system may not be all that different. In theory it amounts to a graduate tax a salary deduction of nine per cent for most of a graduate\u0026rsquos working life, with the lowest earners having their payments indefinitely deferred.  In practice, it\u0026rsquos worse, because \u0026ndash on current projections \u0026ndash taxpayers, including non-graduates, will write off 80 per cent of the student loan book at the end of the 30-year term, handing the money (\u0026pound110 billion and rising at 10 per cent a year) to the banks.  Even Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos plan (since dropped) to write off English student loans was better, since it would at least have avoided the interest payments. Had it been affordable, which it wasn\u0026rsquot.  It\u0026rsquos not clear, though, that the Scottish system, despite its egalitarian intentions, is an improvement. In fact, it\u0026rsquos clear that it\u0026rsquos not, if access to universities by the most deprived young people is the aim. In England, the poorest students are 2.4 times less likely to go to university, and in Wales and Northern Ireland three times less likely. In Scotland, it\u0026rsquos four times less likely.  Because politicians and university administrators tend to be bureaucrats, the row about access for the poorest students and those from minority backgrounds is usually focused on considerations such as social mobility. That\u0026rsquos not the central function of a university, though, even if it is a desirable by-product.  Cardinal Newman, for example, in The Idea of the University, argued that they should provide reflection and instruction to foster \u0026ldquothe culture of the intellect putting the emphasis on universal scope of study, rather than universality of access.  Purists or, if you prefer, elitists, may argue that personal intellectual development is what matters at university. Unfortunately for them, the customers, whether it\u0026rsquos the Government or students themselves, don\u0026rsquot seem to agree. And when you expect financial or social gains, you calculate costs.  Since at least the time of Plato, whose name is still very occasionally bandied about in lecture rooms, there has been a prevailing notion that education is a matter of concern not just to children and parents, but to the whole of society \u0026ndash and that society gains from its utility and should be involved in its provision.  Theorists differed on how Rousseau and his much later disciple John Dewey went for the anti-intellectual, child-centred approach. John Stuart Mill wanted universal education to be required by the state, but on no account to be provided by it.  A depressing number of teachers and lecturers were persuaded by the Marxist view that education is a vital weapon in the class war or, since the 1960s, by the post- or neo-Marxist analytic approach, where the crucial thing is to allow students to develop their own values. The subsequent growth of relativism and disregard for objective truth or free speech now evident in some universities is the result.  But plenty of liberals, Whigs and traditional conservatives valued social mobility as an educational outcome, too (though to protect and expand the bourgeoisie, rather than to overthrow it). That accounts for the Tory enthusiasm for grammar schools. And, by all objective measures, social mobility in 20th century Britain, coinciding with universal education, was much higher than in many other countries.  The problem for our current university system is that, since the expansions of the Major and Blair governments, the supposed advantages education provides for social and financial advancement have been much more widely offered, and expected.  When only 10 or 15 per cent of the population attended university, fees and grants could come from general taxation, and though it was a raw deal for those who didn\u0026rsquot go but footed the bill, the overall benefit could be thought reasonable. If a majority go to university, it is much more unfair that the (almost certainly poorer) minority of the population who don\u0026rsquot end up shouldering the costs.  The current arrangement is unsatisfactory graduates (even in Scotland) have huge debts but, because there are so many of them, no longer always get \u0026ndash though many still expect \u0026ndash better-paid jobs that were the norm until the early 1990s. A degree is now required for plenty of poorly-paid jobs, and is no guarantee of social or financial advancement.  The Russell Group, in a way, embodies that.

It\u0026rsquos, by and large, the university system as it was before 1994.  One solution that preserves their academic elitism and admission standards while encouraging access for more deprived students is to combine the maintenance grant and free tuition by expanding a system most of these universities have long operated: open competitive bursaries. The difficulty is that those from disadvantaged backgrounds tend to fare less well in such tests, because they have been poorly taught at school.  But \u0026ndash assuming universities can lay their hands on some brainy people to do it \u0026ndash tests can be designed to identify potential as well as existing knowledge. Where necessary, they could be supplemented with initiatives already provided by some universities, such as summer schools and foundation courses, to allow wider access.

In an effort to persuade EU leaders to accept Mrs May\u0026rsquos Chequers plan for a soft Brexit, a series of Cabinet ministers warned last week that a chaotic no-deal was increasingly likely.  On Sunday, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox put the odds on crashing out next March without a deal on trade, customs or a transition period as high as 60-40.  He blamed \u0026ldquointransigence and inflexible thinking by officials for continued EU resistance to the Chequers plan, which would cherry-pick arrangements on goods, services and migration. Ms Sturgeon said the heavy-handed \u0026ldquoscare tactics got in the way of more productive talks.  She said: \u0026ldquoA no-deal Brexit would be utterly unacceptable and deeply damaging, but by talking it up as a negotiating tactic there is a very real danger it becomes a reality.  \u0026ldquoWhile the UK\u0026rsquos focus is on scare tactics of no deal, there has no visible progress on securing a future relationship that protects trade in goods and services.  Today\u0026rsquos meeting is the first between the leaders since March, when Ms Sturgeon complained the UK was undermining devolution with the EU Withdrawal Bill.  In the months since, relations between the two governments have nosedived, with the passing of the bill into statute and arguments over the constitution.  In June, SNP MPs walked out of Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions and forced an emergency debate on the Sewel Convention after accusing ministers of treating Scotland with contempt.  The UK Government\u0026rsquos law officers also tried to have Holyrood\u0026rsquos alternative Brexit Bill struck down at the Supreme Court last month.  The Prime Minister will visit the Edinburgh Festival and sign off a \u0026pound1.2 billion City Deal for the capital and south-east Scotland to support innovation, infrastructure, housing and culture. She will say Brexit can result in a \u0026ldquobrighter future for the whole United Kingdom.  \u0026ldquoThese City Deals build on existing strengths to open up new possibilities for the future in Scotland and the whole of the UK as part of our modern Industrial Strategy.  \u0026ldquoAs we leave the EU, the UK Government is working in partnership with business, academia and the devolved administrations to create more good jobs and spread economic prosperity across the country. By making the most of our country\u0026rsquos assets and the talents of all of our people, we can build a brighter future for the whole UK.  Ms Sturgeon said Mrs May had two key challenges before the October meeting of EU leaders: to secure a withdrawal deal and orderly transition, and to get a detailed agreement on future UK-EU relations to let businesses and individuals plan with confidence. This would avoid a vague, confidence.  This would avoid a vague, so-called \u0026ldquoblind Brexit, and let Parliament vote on the deal.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the Chequers proposals falling flat, even if a withdrawal agreement can be secured, there is a very real risk that we end up with a blind Brexit, which will see the UK step off the cliff edge next March without knowing what landing place will be.  \u0026ldquoThat would do as much harm to jobs, investment and the economy as a no-deal Brexit, and would leave the country directionless through the transition period. Given this lack of clarity and real concerns of no agreement, it is time the Prime Minister told us what her Plan B is.  We cannot have no deal and we cannot have a blind Brexit.  \u0026ldquoThe whole of the UK deserves answers. We cannot continue without a back-up plan.  A survey published by the Fraser of Allander think-tank yesterday found 75 per cent of Scots businesses felt in the dark about Brexit and most blamed the UK Government.  Greater clarity would also help Ms Sturgeon decide whether to push for a second independence referendum, something she planned to do in the autumn, but which could be derailed by uncertainty and delay over Brexit.  Ms Sturgeon will also call on the PM to address recent cross-party criticism from MPs that, after 20 years, the UK Government machine still does not fully respect or understand devolution.  She said there had to be \u0026ldquoconstructive and genuine  discussions on Scotland having a proper role in future negotiations.  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government needs to start listening to the views of the people of Scotland, end the power-grab and start respecting the Scottish Parliament, she said.  Funded by \u0026pound300 million each from the UK and Scottish governments and \u0026pound500m from councils in Fife, Edinburgh, Scottish Borders and the Lothians, the City Deal aims to create 21,000 jobs.  Around \u0026pound300m will go on cutting-edge research at Edinburgh three\u0026rsquos universities, \u0026pound140m on road infrastructure, \u0026pound65m on housing and \u0026pound20m on a 1,000-seat concert hall in Edinburgh.

And it also reveals that politeness is alive and well, with \u0026ldquoPlease and \u0026ldquoThank you the most common words learned by holidaymakers (72%).  In addition, more than two-thirds (69%) learnt to say \u0026ldquoHello and \u0026ldquoGoodbye, while 28% learned the phrase \u0026ldquoHow much does it cost?  But there are also signs that many Britons are simply learning how to express their lack of foreign language skills, with more than one in four (28%) teaching themselves to say \u0026ldquoDo you speak English? and 16% saying they learnt to say: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sorry, I don\u0026rsquot speak the language.  Just over a fifth (21%) said they did not learn any words or phrases.  The poll, which questioned almost 2,000 people, also suggests that the days of riffling through the phrasebook are long gone for many younger Britons, with 60% of 16 to 34-year-olds saying they have used smartphones and apps to help understand the local language, while 39% have used a phrasebook.  In total, 42% of those polled said they had taken a phrasebook abroad with them to help them understand the local language, while more than a third (36%) had used their phone.

Nearly three in four (73%) agreed that it is important to learn a few phrases in the local language.  Vicky Gough, schools adviser at the British Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos fantastic that so many of us are ready to give foreign languages a go to make the most of our holidays, and smartphone technology can be a great first step in getting directions and finding out basic information.  \u0026ldquoHowever, this technology has its limits and can\u0026rsquot replicate the linguistic and cultural nuances of human conversation. In fact, as our survey shows, it can potentially lead to a whole new level of confusion, with phrases lost in translation.

While the request is almost certain to be rejected out of hand by the Russian authorities, it will likely reignite the bitter diplomatic row which erupted following the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in March.  Neither the politan Police, which has been leading the investigation into the attack, nor the CPS was prepared to discuss the report.  The Home Office said that as a matter of long-standing policy and practice, the UK would neither confirm nor deny an extradition request had been made or received until such time as an arrest has been made in relation to that request.  The report comes after the Press Association disclosed last month that investigators believed they had identified the suspected perpetrators of the attack and were sure they were Russian.  A source with knowledge of the inquiry said they had been identified through cross-checking CCTV footage with records of people entering the country around the time of the attack.  The Government has been consistent in pointing the finger of blame at Moscow for the poisoning using novichok \u0026ndash a military-grade nerve agent developed by the former Soviet Union.  Two more people \u0026ndash Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley \u0026ndash were subsequently treated for exposure to novichok after Ms Sturgess reportedly picked up a discarded perfume bottle thought to have contained the agent.  Mr Rowley, like the Skripals, recovered from the attack but Ms Sturgess, his partner, died.

David Kemp, a retired TV producer, said: \"I think it is a real insult to him that he should be ignored in this way.  \"There is no mention of him at all.  \"I do not want to be strident about it, but I would like to say that the Kemp family are upset by this, the lack of mention of his work.\"  He added: \"I am surprised the Festival Society did not twig to this, and say: we are dealing with our own history here, let\u0027s get it right.  \"He wrote other plays at the festival: he was a central and seminal figure.\"  Jackie Kemp, a business content creator and grand-daughter of Robert, added: \"Robert Kemp\u0026rsquos reworking of the Three Estates was a huge achievement.  \"Robert was a gifted playwright and storyteller who spoke and wrote in Scots - but he was also a scholar of the language, with a deep knowledge of its literature and history.  \"He is part of a tradition and would be happy to see others reworking the original text - but I think he deserves to be remembered and recognised for his contribution.\"  Mr Kemp noted that he was still waiting for an apology for the oversight.  A statement from the EIF said: \"The rehearsed reading presented by the International Festival and National Theatre of Scotland, uses extracts adapted from the original 16th century play by Sir David Lindsay, rather than the 1948 work adapted by Robert Kemp and directed by Tyrone Guthrie.  \"The International Festival recognises Robert Kemp\u0026rsquos enormous contribution to the landmark 1948 production and the extraordinary legacy of this piece, which continues to inspire theatre makers to this day.\"  The play was first performed at Linlithgow Palace, probably in the Banqueting Hall in 1540, before King James V and the queen, Marie de Lorraine.  In his written introduction to The Satire of the Three Estates, Robert Kemp, writing in 1948, said he hoped his notes show how he \"tackled the problem of making an old Scottish classic actable by modern actors and comprehensible to a modern audience, whilst doing the least possible violence to it.\"  He added: \"When the Festival Committee announced that Scottish drama was to be represented by a four hundreds year old morality play, which had not held the stage in the interval and did not so much as figure in the leaving certificate examinations, even the most patriotic seemed to feel that here was boldness to the point of recklessness.\"  Mr Kemp\u0027s version was cut until the play last around two hours.  He said: \"I had to cut where the Satire was too long and too broad.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-brexit-can-lead-to-brighter-future-for-whole-uk","story":"  Theresa May will announce a \u0026pound1.2 billion city deal for Edinburgh and the south-east of Scotland, with both the Scottish and UK Governments committing \u0026pound300 million towards this.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 9:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

We offer free stalls to local businesses as we want to encourage them to be involved.\u0026ldquoAt the RBLS we provide a lot of veteran support and our ethos is focused on military support and participation inclusion.\u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have so many para-athletes taking part this year from around the globe. A delegation from the RBLS Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch visited Australia in April this year to mark Anzac Day so it\u0026rsquos fitting that we will have a number of Australian para-athletes taking part.\u0026ldquoWe want to make sure each of the para-athletes and everybody at the games has an enjoyable time.He stressed how the games have been \u0026ldquoramped up by comparing the number of marquees this year with the total put up two years ago, only three.\u0026ldquoThere has been a massive amount of work behind the scenes by a dedicated group of members to ensure the games not only takes place but grows to a more sustainable level.The build-up to the Mey Games will get under way with a North Coast 500 cycling challenge that will depart from Wick\u0026rsquos Market Square on July 28 and arrive back in the town on August 3, the day before the games.On the morning of the games, at 9.30am, there will be a rededication ceremony at the grave of General Lord Horne in Wick cemetery. \u0026ldquoWe shall honour Wick\u0026rsquos own hero of the Great War with a colour party and piper in attendance at this short but poignant event, Capt Otley said.Events kicks off at 11am and include Highland dancing competitions, pipe and drum bands, the tug of war, dog show and live music, as well as various exhibitions, local art, crafts and food stalls.The event will take place at John O\u0026rsquoGroats for the third time after travel company Natural Retreats stepped in after the previous games location, close to the Castle of Mey, became waterlogged.Since then the company has continued to provide ongoing complimentary use of the showground.Ewan Kearney, chief operating officer at Natural Retreats, said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted to support the Mey Games again this year.For more information, visit the Mey Games Facebook page: https://www.facebook/MeyGames/Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 9:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116890.jpg","title":"Prince Charles to launch Highland Games initiative","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe decided to act after seeing a steady decline in athletes taking part in the Mey Games, which he has attended every year since 2002.The prince \u0026ndash known as the Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland \u0026ndash hopes the initiative will provide a more secure and better future for the games.Robert Lovie of The Prince\u0026rsquos Foundation, which is involved in the proposal, said the prince was aware of a lack of competition in the heavy and other traditional events at the Mey Games.\u0026ldquoHe was aware of it and wanted to do something about it, Mr Lovie, the foundation\u0026rsquos director of outreach, said.\u0026ldquoThe prince has had an interest in Highland Games since he was a little boy and attended the Braemar Gathering.

It may be possible at some point to have a junior games.The idea will be taken into secondary schools to start with, although in the longer term primaries would be included as well.

He will train youth leaders in the area to pass on the skills and techniques used in tossing the caber, tug-of-war and hammer-throwing.He said: \u0026ldquoThere are currently few routes into Highland Games for young people in Scotland.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

track","story":"\u0026nbspMULTI-million pound efforts to improve water supplies in Ross-shire have been welcomed by a local MP.Jamie Stone visited a Scottish Water site near Evanton this week to view progress on a \u0026pound5.5 million project to improve security of the water supply for customers across much of Easter Ross and beyond.Work at the site has been underway since February this year and is expected to be complete in early 2019.A new tank is being built with a capacity to store up to eight million litres of drinking water, improving security of supply for around 30,000 customers across Easter Ross, Dingwall and the Black Isle.The work is being carried out by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD, in partnership with contractor Coffey Construction.After seeing the work in progress and receiving an update on Scottish Water\u0026rsquos current work across his Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross constituency, Mr Stone said: \"The long period of dry weather this summer is a reminder that, even in the Highlands, water is a precious resource that we all rely on in countless ways.\"The work currently taking place will help to improve the security of water supply for Easter Ross in the event of any future issues at the water treatment works or disruption to the local water network.\u0026nbsp\"At the same time, it is good to hear of the work Scottish Water\u0026rsquos operational teams are currently carrying out across the north to maintain supplies and protect the local environment.\"Despite some recent rainfall, it is still important that we use water wisely to help lochs and reservoirs recover so that supplies can be maintained through the rest of the summer and beyond,\" he added.ESD project manager Kevin Williamson said the works remained on track for completion next year.He said: \"The work we are delivering reflects a significant investment for one of the key water supply areas in the Highlands, which serves communities right around the Cromarty Firth.\"Work on site is going well and we anticipate it will be complete early next year.\u0026nbsp\"Once in place, the new storage tank will give Scottish Water improved ability to carry out important maintenance work at the water treatment works, and deal with any short term issues affecting the local water network, without impact on customers\u0026rsquo water supply.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMeanwhile, Scottish Water has urged customers to do what they can to conserve water amidst this year\u0026rsquos very dry summer.Its strategic customer service planning team Leader for the north, Jim Briggs, said: \"Separately from this longer term investment, we are continuing work in consultation with Sepa to manage water resources across the north following the prolonged period of dry weather.\"Despite some rainfall in many areas over the past week, our frontline teams are continuing to work hard to ensure we can maintain supplies to all of our customers.\"We continue to need customers to help us by using water wisely, for example by using a watering can instead of a hose in the garden and only using dishwashers and washing machines when fully loaded.\u0026nbsp\"The support of thousands of customers with these small and simple steps can make a big difference to maintaining water supplies for everyone and allowing water resources to recover when rainfall occurs.\"He added that the Evanton project will help to provide \"clear, fresh-tasting drinking water to our customers in a wide range of circumstances\".Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 9:37

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants. We offer a full service which takes the hassle away from the owner and gives them peace of mind that we will manage the whole lettings process, ensure the rent is paid, and find the best possible tenant.\"Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 9:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I spoke to Cockburns and they came forward and agreed that we could have the kit fitted.\"Cockburns was the first business that we approached because we were looking for somewhere in the West End.\"The timing was just great because literally the day after they agreed to do it a nationwide campaign was launched for butchers to do the same thing \u0026ndash so Cockburns have spearheaded things.\"He added: \"This equipment is so valuable.\"Somebody that collapses outside of hospital has a six per cent chance of survival but when you have one of these kits available it can go up to around 70 per cent.\"The bank\u0026rsquos generous donation is also expected to pay for kits to be fitted in Inverness, Thurso and Kirkwall.Lucky2BeHere has a strong network of volunteer defibrillator trainers across the Highlands and Islands.It has fundraised for around 200 units so far and Dingwall now has one at the primary school, outside Castle Street Church of Scotland and Highland Council\u0026rsquos Ross House building in High Street.There are other kits in various places around Ross-shire including Contin Village Stores.And another unit is due to be fitted outside Alness Pharmacy within the next month.A nationwide campaign called \"Butchers at the Heart of the Community\" is now encouraging butchers to display collection tins in their shop in an effort to raise money for a local defibrillator.More than 30 Scottish butchers have signed up to the scheme so far, with hopes that further shops will follow suit in the future.Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 9:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The disastrous roll-out of universal credit that was piloted in the Highlands has resulted in vast swathes of unnecessary suffering.\"Folk, many of whom are working, are being driven into destitution and families are being left with no choice but to rely on foodbanks.\u0026nbsp\"These are political choices and it\u0026rsquos high time those in power in Westminster took responsibility for the unnecessary suffering they are causing to folk in the Highlands, and indeed across the UK.\"Ms Todd and fellow SNP MSP Kate Forbes have now opened up their office for use as a food drop-off point in a bid to encourage more Ross-shire residents to donate as organisations struggle to keep up with demand.The kind-hearted pair said constituents will be able to leave food parcels, containing non-perishable items including pasta, rice and coffee, at their office in Dingwall High Street.And they have teamed up with Blythswood Care, which runs the Highland foodbank network, in response to the news that the number of children using the Dingwall site has risen by more than 50 per cent. The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. This is deeply concerning.\"Across the Highlands there is a 10 per cent year-on-year rise in the number of adults receiving food parcels, whilst the number is over 25 per cent for children.\"It\u0026rsquos a sign of the times that people are dependent on food donations in a rich country \u0026ndash and an indictment on welfare reform which has left people with no other choices.\"Although the total number of people across the Highlands and the number of children using food banks have both risen, the number of adults being referred to the Dingwall food bank has fallen.Blythswood Care\u0026rsquos projects manager Finlay Mackenzie spoke of his gratitude to the two MSPs for opening their office for donations.He believes families who normally receive additional support during the school term need more help during the summer holidays.He said: \"Sadly we see an increase in referrals to our food banks across the Highlands year on year.\"This summer there has been an even greater need with many families needing extra support who would usually receive free school meals and have children who attend breakfast clubs.\"Food donations usually drop during the summer but with media support we have been very encouraged by the generous donations by the public.\"We are very grateful for the support and involvement of Kate Forbes MSP and Maree Todd MSP whose backing helps to highlight the plight of local people in times of crisis.\"Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 9:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 9:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news – sooner or later, we’ll all reach the end of our lives. Many of us are not keen to face this event, nor the time that comes directly before. It’s actually hard to say what is the bigger taboo, death or the personal care that most of us receive in our final days and weeks.            According to the World Health Organisation, more than half of us die of an illness that requires some form of end of life care. Depending on your definitions, the figure can be much higher – a German study found it to be more like four out of five, which is in line with findings from my work in Scotland. Either way, care providers expect the absolute numbers of people in Western countries in need of end-of-life care to keep growing as populations continue to grow older in future.            As you might expect, older people have a higher chance of developing ailments that need care. The group of those experiencing a long period of dwindling physical and mental faculties due to frail old age or dementia is already rising: according to the death records that we examined in Scotland, for example, it doubled from 5.1 per cent in 2001-02 to 9.7 per cent in 2011-12, and dementia rates have continued to increase. The share of people undergoing shorter periods of decline, such as cancer patients, rose to 29.5 per cent of all deaths in 2011-12. These numbers are slightly higher than many other countries, but roughly comparable.Given these figures, you may wonder: what is life like at its end? Do people receive the care and support they need? The answer is, not everyone does. My colleague Iain Atherton and I mapped the last year of people’s lives in Scotland using a mixture of census data NHS data, and death records. Here’s what we found out.READ MORE: Private care home chief warns sector is ‘on the brink’We looked at all 53,517 people who died in Scotland within a year of the last census in 2011. About one in five were below pension age, half were aged 65-84, and just under a third were 85 or older. Every third person lived alone, and around 40 per cent were widowed. Not the ideal situation when you need care.The closer people were to dying, the more likely they were to have moved in with others. This varied by neighbourhood deprivation, however. In more deprived areas, 37 per cent of people aged 70 and over – those most likely to need care – still lived alone, even in the last four weeks of their lives. In the least deprived areas, the rate was 25 per cent. (In this age group as a whole, 18 per cent of people died in a care home.)            To my knowledge, nobody has come up with directly comparable figures for other countries. From Eurostat data from 2014, though, we do know that 32 per cent of over-65s in the EU live alone, for example, and that the UK is almost exactly in line with the average.Let’s be honest: few people find the idea of living alone in old age appealing, no matter what their health status. In many cases, it goes hand-in-hand with depending on external services for care – strangers that invade the innermost sphere of your privacy. It’s probably one of the major reasons why people don’t like talking about this stage of life.Yet if we want to make our last months and years of life less bleak, talking and acting is exactly what we need to do. As I have just discussed at a show at the Edinburgh Fringe on the subject, we should consider new options. We need to think outside the box, and ensure that we are the decision-makers instead of being pushed back into the role of dependent.READ MORE: Let elderly Scots keep beloved pets in care homes, says Labour            Are retirement villages an option, for example? Or better still, housing complexes with people from different generations, where even a frail grandad can help the neighbour’s boy with his homework and still feel part of the community? Or can you band together with some friends, either in one house or in adjacent flats?In many cases, care decisions are made ad hoc, because an immediate solution is required. When your mother has had yet another fall and it’s clear she can no longer stay on her own and needs a care home bed in two days when she comes out of the hospital, there is no time to find the best home for her. You must take the place that is available.Isn’t it funny that many of us tend to take out life insurance in case we die prematurely but don’t make provisions for the very likely possibility that we’ll need care? I doubt you look forward to your care home stay, the tightly scheduled visit of the district nurse, or the look on the face of your children when they need to decide whether they want to sell the house they grew up in to pay for better care for you.Rich or poor, man or woman, the clock is ticking for all of us. Too many older people are facing the most vulnerable stage in their adult lives alone, and the next generation needs to find ways of avoiding this situation. It’s not to say that governments and healthcare providers shouldn’t take responsibility for care – they do anyway – but if we blindly rely on them to provide, there are limits to what we will receive. Before it’s too late, it’s better that we also come up with plans of our own.            Anna Schneider is a research fellow in social policy at Edinburgh Napier University.

The best-laid schemes for the average week at Westminster are normally in tatters by Monday lunchtime.                But amid the hurly-burly, I’ve watched the slow-motion car crash of the Tories’ failure to tackle the challenge to devolution posed by Brexit with a mixture of frustration and anger. Now that abject failure has been called out in a report from the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. Every warning ignored. Every amendment opposed. Every golden opportunity to fix the problem squandered. Many of the consequences of a Leave vote have been surprising. The potential for conflict with the devolution settlement is not. The fault lines were there but Brexit, the transfer of further powers to Holyrood, Cardiff Bay and the English metro mayors, coupled with the inflexibility of our constitution has turned them into dangerous cracks.            READ MORE: Joyce McMillan: Is Scotland that real ‘vassal’ state?            The game has changed. That’s why at every stage of the EU Withdrawal Bill we have tried to strengthen the role of the Joint Ministerial Committee and enshrine those intergovernmental relationships in legislation. We called for regular reports to Parliament and for minutes to be published in the interest of transparency. Instead, we got David Mundell, the invisible man in Cabinet. A figure who has made himself so superfluous to requirements that he is not considered worthy of a seat at the inner Brexit Cabinet table. For a Scottish Secretary from a party which claims to be a defender of the union, that is playing fast and loose with it.Instead of closing down the potential routes for grievance by establishing a formal role for the devolved governments, he has turned inaction into an artform, all the time sleepwalking into a position which has the nationalists rubbing their hands with glee at the mischief they can make from it. If Scotland’s two governments put cause before country every time, then we must put formal structures in place to ensure co-operation and guarantee respect for the settled will of the people. Make no mistake. I take no pleasure in having been proved right. Just as John Smith warned more than a quarter of a century ago, there are two parties sawing away at the legs that support the union. There is no hiding place for David Mundell when this damning verdict comes from a cross-party committee chaired by a Conservative MP.

Yet for all their compliance, what has Ruth’s London battalion achieved? No bucks and precious little bang.            So where next? Only the narrow separatist agenda of the SNP is being served by this impasse. It is a blank canvas onto which they project every gripe. Amid the arguments about Brexit, such simplistic messaging holds dangerously broad appeal. Yet we have an emasculated Scotland Office, with no permanent staff, failing to grasp the thistle. That is why a Labour government will establish a Constitutional Convention to advise on reforming the way post-Brexit Britain works and if the current arrangement is serving the people well enough by ensuring there is an adequate redistribution of power as well as wealth.Even if the Tories cannot bring themselves to admit we got it right, a starting point would be to get to work on delivering the recommendations in this report – but I won’t hold my breath.Lesley Laird MP is Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4779673.1533620089!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit nicola sturgeon urges theresa may to set out plan b","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Theresa May will be urged to set out a \u0026#8220Plan B\u0026#8221 for Brexit during crunch talks with Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh today amid growing fears that the UK will leave the EU without a deal.                  The Prime Minister has said ahead of the meeting that the Brexit aftermath can lead to the spread of “economic prosperity across the country.”             But it comes as a stark survey of businesses north of the Border warns of a negative economic impact of life outside the EU for Scotland with “uncertainty in the UK government’s negotiating position” criticised.            The leaders meet with relations between Westminster and Holyrood at an all-time low as both governments are locked in an unprecedented constitutional battle at the UK Supreme Court over claims of a power grab on the Scottish Parliament.Mrs May will sign off £600 million  of city deal funding for Edinburgh as she visits the capital and agree millions more in further investment north of the Border.The trip  will be dominated by ongoing concerns over Brexit, though, with Ms Sturgeon poised to step up the pressure on the Prime Minister as  negotiations in Brussels show little sign of breakthrough with just seven months until the UK’s departure.UK Trade Secretary Liam Fox warned at the weekend the prospect of a “no deal” Brexit now looks the most likely scenario. It would mean hefty tariffs for firms exporting into Europe and questions over the future of EU nationals living here.But Mrs May said ahead of today’s visit: “As we leave the EU, the UK Government is working in partnership with business, academia and the devolved administrations to create more good jobs and spread economic prosperity across the country.            “By making the most of our country’s assets and the talents of all of our people, we can build a brighter future for the whole UK.”Read more: Nicola Sturgeon leads Britain’s most influential woman pollThe UK government has been touting its plans for Brexit agreed at Chequers – including plans for a common rulebook on all goods – to the EU and its leaders. But the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier already appears to have rejected the plan, prompting widespread concern that a “no deal” scenario seems inevitable.  The First Minister will today call on Mrs May to set out a “Plan B” to secure agreement on withdrawal and also lay the groundwork for the UK’s post-Brexit future.            “A no deal Brexit would be utterly unacceptable and deeply damaging, but by talking it up as a negotiating tactic there is a very real danger it becomes a reality,” Ms Sturgeon said ahead of the meeting.“With the Chequers proposals falling flat, even if a withdrawal agreement can be secured, there is a very real risk that we end up with a blind Brexit – which will see the UK step off the cliff edge next March without knowing what landing place will be.“That would do as much harm to jobs, investment and the economy as a no deal Brexit and would leave the country directionless through the transition period.“Given this lack of clarity and real concerns of no agreement, it is time the Prime Minister told us what her Plan B is.   We cannot have no deal and we cannot have a blind Brexit. “The whole of the UK deserves answers from the Prime Minister and we cannot continue without a back up plan.”            A new survey of 350 firms north of the border conducted out by the respect Fraser of Allander Institute think tank paints an increasingly gloomy picture of the post-Brexit economic landscape in Scotland.Only 6 per cent said the Brexit decision had a positive impact on their business, with 44 per cent saying it had been damaging. It also found three-quarters of firms said they had not received enough information about leaving the European Union to allow them to plan for the different possible outcomes of Brexit – with 59 per cent blaming “uncertainty in the UK’s government’s objectives” in the negotiations as the key factor in this.An agreed settlement still remains the probable result of the ongoing Brexit talks, a spokesman for the Prime Minister said yesterday, but  there is a risk negotiations may fail.“We continue to believe that a deal is the most likely outcome, because reaching a good deal is not only in the interests of the UK, it is in the interests of the EU and its 27 members,” he added.“But the Trade Secretary is right to say there is a risk of the negotiations not succeeding and the government has to prepare for all eventualities.”The spokesman said the Brexit White Paper published last month following the Cabinet summit at Chequers was recognised by Brussels as “a significant move.”“Following the publication of the White Paper, we are now in a serious conversation across a broad range of issues with the EU,” he said.“They recognise that the White Paper represents a significant move by the UK and now they need to respond.”Former Brexit secretary David Davis has warned that the EU will be making a “massive miscalculation” if it thinks the UK is not ready to walk away from talks without a deal.“This has great scope for being a massive miscalculation on the part of the EU that could end up with no deal by accident,” Mr Davis said“It’s certainly not the intention of the EU to have a no-deal Brexit but they are misjudging us at the moment. The UK Parliament does not want no deal but it’s certainly not going to be pushed around by the European Parliament.”Chancellor Philip Hammond has also privately warned City bankers to seek non-European business in preparation for possible restrictions on access to EU markets, it was reported yesterday.Ms Sturgeon has already indicated that she plans to a second independence referendum after Brexit once the terms of the UK’s departure from the EU become clear, but that is unlikely to be the focus of today’s talks.The UK Supreme Court is currently considering an unprecedented constitutional clash between Westminster and Holyrood. It comes after the Scottish Government passed its own post-Brexit legal framework for Scotland, after claiming that the UK’s Government’s EU Withdrawal Bill was a “power grab” on the Scottish Parliament in key areas like agriculture and fishing. Although a political agreement on that now seems unlikely, Ms Sturgeon \u2028will call on the Prime Minister to engage in discussions about how to give Scotland a role in future negotiations following a recent  House of Commons Public Administration \u2028and Constitutional Affairs committee report highlighting the lack of proper engagement with devolved governments.“The UK government has launched a power grab on the Scottish Parliament and now even a House of Commons committee says Whitehall takes little account of the realities of devolution in the UK,” the SNP leader added.“It cannot carry on like this and the UK government needs to start listening to the  views of the people of Scotland.”Westminster has said it must hold on to some powers being repatriated from the EU for a limited period to protect the integrity of the UK market.Read more: Brexit could have a ‘disastrous’ impact on Edinburgh International Festival"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4779671.1533588089!/image/image.jpg","title":"health board denies boss received 300k payoff","story":"        A beleaguered health board has denied its former chief executive received a \u0026#163300,000 \u0026#8220golden handshake\u0026#8221.                Lesley McLay left NHS Tayside last week after going on sick leave in April – the day after being told she could no longer continue in her role.            She was heavily criticised after it emerged the health board had used charity money to help fund routine services.            Dundee MSP Jenny Marra said she believed the former chief executive had received a pay-off of more than £300,000, but a spokeswoman for the health board said it was “categorically untrue” that Ms McLay had received any money other than that she was contractually entitled to.Earlier this year it emerged NHS Tayside transferred £2.7 million from its endowment fund into core expenditure. More than £2m was spent on an IT system.A new chairman and chief executive were appointed to run NHS Tayside after the health board was put in “special measures” by the Scottish Government.Ms Marra said any severance deal for Ms McLay raised questions for the government, which she said would be required to sign off on the deal.She said: “I think it’s a huge sum to be awarded to a chief executive who presided over financial chaos. The Scottish Parliament’s audit committee was very clear in its view that severance payments would be unacceptable in these circumstances.             “This is taxpayer’s money and it’s been awarded to someone whose performance was woefully lacking for a number of years. It’s a slap in the face for the public and for NHS Tayside staff.”She added: “I want to know who signed this off at Scottish Government level and why they decided to do so. NHS Tayside has not been at all transparent about this. If this contract – for whatever sum – is not yet complete, then I would expect the Scottish Government to step in and make sure this award is not made.” Lib Dem health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton said: “Such a sum of money would be enough to pay 10 nurses for a year.“Allegations of financial mismanagement were what triggered changes at the top of NHS Tayside. If a payout of this scale was given we need to know how this came about and who at the top of the NHS approved it.”            A spokeswoman for NHS Tayside denied Ms McLay had received severance pay totalling more than £300,000.She said: “The claims made about any sum of money received by Ms McLay are categorically untrue. As with any NHS Tayside employee, Ms McLay received what she was contractually entitled to and nothing more upon leaving the organisation.”Read more: Humza Yousaf brands Home Office immigration policy ‘cruel’"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770841.1533568043!/image/image.jpg","title":"humza yousaf brands home office immigration policy cruel","story":"        Justice secretary Humza Yousaf has insisted the Home Office\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220cruel\u0026#8221 immigration policy requires an \u0026#8220injection of humanity\u0026#8221.

And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"37 bruce crescent lerwick ze1 0pb ","story":"Offers over £167,000\n\n Externally: Off-road parking, a large front, side and back garden and an outside bin store.\nThe property is in move into condition.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nTuesday 7 Aug 2018 9:38 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PORTREE-V-VNW-SKYE-1.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

a great way to save money.\nA spokeswoman for Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council this week refuted the claims, saying: There have been no instances lately of bins not being collected other than due to local access issues and these are always followed up the next day.\u0026#160 \nStaff in the Waste team have flexible job roles and are employed where needed across cleansing, waste and recycling centres.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06.jpg","title":"65378  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship has taken place.\nEleven international teams are making Antrim their home for this week\u0027s event. \nTwo hundred young people from USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain,\u0026#160 Republic of Ireland,\u0026#160 France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nSpectators will have a great view from the Lough Shore of the 11 picturesque gigs as they race on Lough Neagh.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05.jpg","title":"65379  ","story":"    \nTHE 2018 MCE Insurance Ulster Grand Prix is less than a month away and anticipation is certainly building. \nFollowing a TT that saw Peter Hickman demolish the outright lap record to win a thrilling Senior TT finale ahead of Dean Harrison, the 7.4011 miles of Dundrod tarmac is the next meeting ground for these road-racing heavyweights. \nPeter, UGP Man of the Meeting in 2017 and now the world\u0027s fastest rider, secured podium finishes in four classes, three of which were as race winner.\nUlster Grand Prix Bike Week runs from August 5-11 and is gearing up to be the perfect climax to the international road-racing season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a03.jpg","title":"65381  ","story":"    \nA SECTARIAN killer has appeared at Antrim Magistrate\u0027s Court charged with escaping lawful custody.\nStanding handcuffed in the dock, 32-year-old Christopher Kerr spoke only to confirm that he understood the four charges against him.\nIn addition to an offence of escaping lawful custody, Kerr is also accused of three drugs offences.\nThe alleged offences arose after he allegedly ran away from prison officers in Victoria Square shopping centre while out on day release.\nKerr, who is currently serving a life term for the shocking and horrifying sectarian attack which claimed the life of 15-year-old Catholic schoolboy Michael McIlveen, was arrested at Antrim Area Hospital the following day. \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a02f2.jpg","title":"65382  ","story":"    \nA CRUMLIN family has again been hit by tragedy after the sudden death of a teenager, just weeks after his father passed away.\nHenry Turley (14)\u0026#160 fell from a hotel balcony in the beach resort of Playa de Muro on Majorca in the early hours of last Wednesday (July 18).\nSpanish Civil Guard said his mother Claire was holding on to his hand and attempting to save him after he overbalanced on the second floor balcony before he fell at around midnight.\nHenry\u0027s death comes less than seven weeks after his father Stephen, who ran the Ten Storey tattoo parlour in Crumlin, was discovered dead at a friend\u0027s house.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06f-jpg.jpg","title":"65469  ","story":"    \nWITH last weekend\u0027s downpour bringing Antrim to a standstill, it was no surprise that rain also stopped played at Muckamore Cricket Club!\nAfter weeks of fine weather, normal service was finally resumed with one of the most dramatic downpours in living memory.\nMuckamore Firsts were taking on North Down at the time, but the players soon beat a hasty retreat to the clubhouse when the skies opened.

in 2017 from Queen\u0027s University.\n  \nThe music graduate can play the tin whistle, the flute and the harp and has also excelled in the Irish dancing world.\n  \nAs a pupil of the Logan McCloskey School of Irish Dancing, Roisin is no stranger to the stage having graced many over Ireland over the years showcasing reels, jigs and hornpipes.\n  \n She now has Tralee in her sights and the coveted title of this year\u0027s Rose of Tralee.\n  \nIt is an amazing experience to be part of, Roisin explained.\n  \nI have to get approximately 15 dresses organised for the Festival and a few businesses and dress makers have very kindly sponsored me.\n  \nBefore the Festival we are going to the Glaway Races and Kildare to meet all of the other roses.\n  \nThere are currently 57 roses and that will be whittled down to 32 who will appear on RTE for television interviews.\n  \nIf Roisin is one of the lucky 32 she said the television interview with Daithi will not make her nervous.\n  \nMy business is all about teaching children how to be confident and outgoing in public so I think I will be ok in the interview if I am lucky enough to get that far.\n  \nRoisin will play a selected piece of music on her custom made tin whistle which was presented to her by Killarney Whistle.\n  \nShe will also be presented with exquisite jewellery from Tipperary Crystal to match her gowns for the festival.\n  \nRoisin\u0027s mum, dad, two brothers and three sisters plan to travel to Tralee to cheer her on along with the extended family.\n  \nRoisin concluded: I would love to win the festival but most of

enterprise programme launches in mid and east antrim","story":"  \nMID and East Antrim Borough Council has partnered with the Department for the Economy and Enterprise Northern Ireland for a new enterprise programme aimed at boosting jobs and business in the borough.\n  \nThe Exploring Enterprise 4 Programme, delivered under the European Social fund (ESF) Programme 2014-2020, will be managed by Enterprise Northern Ireland and rolled out locally by LEDCOM and Carrickfergus Enterprise.\n  \nThe Exploring Enterprise Programme is a free special support initiative aimed at helping unemployed or economically inactive individuals improve their employment prospects as well as exploring potential self-employment opportunities.\n  \nThe course provides one-to-one tailored business mentoring support, with the opportunity to work towards achieving an accredited QCF Level 1 Qualification in Understanding Business Enterprise.\n  \nParticipants will get the opportunity to visit local businesses and work as part of a team to develop business skills and knowledge.\n  \nThrough Amplify, the integrated economic strategy for the borough, Council is committed to growing the economy whilst focusing on developing and supporting entrepreneurial activity across Mid and East Antrim.\n  \nCllr Lindsay Millar, Mayor of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, said: “Our Council is focused on supporting the business growth journey to enable businesses to create jobs and wealth throughout the borough.\n  \n“Earlier this year Council launched an exciting new strategy to boost the economy across the borough, called ‘Amplify’.\n  \n“Amplify aims to support the development of Mid and East Antrim right through until 2030.\n  \n“Growing the economy is Council’s top priority in Mid and East Antrim and Amplify allows us to support a number of businesses from the start-up to growth phases.\n  \n“The support and opportunities available from the new business programmes offered through ‘Amplify’ help to create a vibrant business culture within our borough.\n  \n“We are blessed with an abundance of talent throughout our borough and it is crucial we work together to harness those skills and potential by providing practical advice and guidance for start-ups and established businesses.”\n  \nMichael McQuillan, Chief Executive of Enterprise Northern Ireland, said: “This is a fantastic opportunity for participants who are experiencing challenges or facing barriers to entering or returning to the labour market, to gain an understanding of enterprise and become employment or self-employment ready.\n  \n“While being provided with the opportunity to explore self-employment as an option, the participant can work towards a recognised qualification in Understanding Business. This endorsement professionalises their engagement in the programme and is something they will always have to evidence their capability, as they build a career in enterprise.”\n  \nThis project is part-funded through the Northern Ireland European Social Fund Programme 2014 – 2020, the Department for the Economy, and Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.\n  \nFor more information on the Exploring Enterprise Programme or other business support in Mid and East Antrim, contact: amplify@midandeast\n  \nantrim.gov.uk\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk28026-8492781.jpg","title":"65215  ","story":"    \nTHOUSANDS of mourners are expected to make the pilgrimage to Garryduff Presbyterian Church in Ballymoney on Wednesday to pay their respects to William Dunlop.\nFuneral arrangements have been put in place for the 32-year-oldmotorcyclist who tragically lost his life after an accident during a practice session for the Skerries 100 road races on Saturday, July 7.\nThe popular Ballymoney man was involved in an incident at the Sam\u0027s Tunnel section of the County Dublin circuit.\nThe Funeral Service in Garryduff Presbyterian Church will take place on Wednesday at 1pm followed by interment in the adjoining churchyard.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

John Kirkpatrick paid testament to William\u0027s character.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"65300  ","story":"                \nBALLYMONEY Foodbank has seen an almost 20% increase in usage since the introduction of Universal Credit in November 2017.\nThis is the disturbing news revealed by a Director of the local Foodbank after they recently compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017 (excluding December which is always a peak month for any foodbank) and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Loughbrickland Branch looks forward to proudly representing Loughbrickland area at the event.”\n\nAs local champions of Remembrance, the Loughbrickland Branch of The Royal British Legion is looking to work in partnership with their community to bring their unique Remembrance message to the Menin Gate, on their wreath, where it will be displayed in a wreath installation for viewing by the general public until the end of August. Two schools Scarva Primary and Bronte Primary have written messages that will be attached to the wreath\n\nThe parade will start at midday and we encourage the public to make the trip across to Ypres for the August 8 and fill the Market Square to watch the parade, One Hundred Days ceremony and then enjoy an afternoon of musical entertainment including The Central Band of the Royal British Legion.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIf you want to find out more about GP90 or your local Royal British Legion branch, then visit www. britishlegion.org.uk/branches/loughbrickland or contact Loughbrickland.Secretary@rblmunity\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8529070.1533295653!/image/image.jpg","title":"remains of joint was found in the driver s seat of vehicle","story":"\nWhen police noticed the smell of cannabis coming from a car they found the remains of a joint in the driver\u0026#8217s seat, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nJustin Henderson McGowan, whose address was given as Clare Road, Tandragee, admitted unlawful possession of cannabis and herbal cannabis on May 13 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe court heard that at 8.45pm a police mobile patrol in Meadow Lane, Portadown, noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from the defendant’s vehicle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe remains of a joint were found on the driver’s seat and he accepted he had a grinder with a small amount of cannabis in it.

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix. It is a region which he enjoys and which he hopes to visit again.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kerri ann in limbo as she faces long wait","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA YOUNG\n Newtownabbey woman who suffers from suspected multiple sclerosis (MS) has said that “nothing in her future is certain” as she faces a possible two-year wait for treatment.\n\n24-year-old Kerri Ann Flanagan had suffered from bouts of paralysis and pain for around five years before optic neurosis claimed the sight in one of her eyes in April.\n\nAfter years of misdiagnosis, Kerri Ann was eventually referred to a neurologist and an MRI scan showed a number of symptoms linked to MS.\n\nThe MRI uncovered 10 lesions on Kerri Ann’s brain and instances of demyelination – where the cover on the nerve cells on the brain is worn away, leaving them exposed to further damage.\n\nDespite the severity of her condition, Kerri Ann could be faced with a two-year wait for treatment, and she said she’s  “absolutely terrified”.\n\n“That worry and that fear has caused me so much extra stress and anxiety,” she said. \n\n“The waiting lists are adding pressure to people who are already dealing with so much. I just feel like nothing in my future is certain any more. I had so many ideas of things I wanted to do, I was planning on getting married to my fiancé, and now I just feel like my life is on hold. I’ve been suffering from the symptoms for about five years. It has gotten worse in the last two years, especially with the pain.\n\n“When I went to A\u0026#038E with the paralysis they told me it was a migraine and sent me home.\n\n“It was awful because I knew that it wasn’t the case – I knew there was more to it. You know your own body. It was really frustrating and I felt that because of my age I was constantly being dismissed. \n\n“They were saying things like ‘Somebody your age wouldn’t have’ whatever, but there are plenty of young people who suffer from things like MS. It’s really important that they start to realise that. It was frustrating to be treated that way.”\n\nAs well as suffering some of the most debilitating symptoms linked to MS, Kerri Ann told how her condition impacts on her mental health.\n\n“It’s hard,” she said. \n\n“Since I took really ill in May and lost my sight it’s gone really downhill from there. So many symptoms keep flaring up. There are days I can’t get out of bed. It’s very unpredictable. I don’t even want to leave the house because things can change so fast. I could be fine one minute then in and hour I could lost the ability the to walk, I could fall, or my speech could be slurred. It makes me very self-conscious as well. I have had people ask if I’m drunk or on something else. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, but it’s so difficult to explain. It has just made my life so hard. My mental health has suffered terribly, not just because of the MS, but because of the pressure of the wait on an appointment. There are lots of people with different health problems, serious health problems that are in a similar situation. It’s not acceptable.”\n\nKerri Ann’s mum, Kim Flanagan, said that underfunding of the NHS was exacerbating her daughter’s condition. \n\n“In 2016 there was an MS specialist in the Royal [Victoria Hospital] who has come out on a number of occasions and said that his patients were waiting 16 months to be seen, that it was unacceptable and that it was endangering they’re health,” she said. \n\n“He said that it was down to cuts in budget. Kerri Ann will wait 12 months to see a neurologist, and then it could be a further six months or more for and MS clinic. That’s almost two years before you get a treatment plan. She has been paralysed in both legs and one arm. She has had trouble swallowing, chewing and talking, feeling like she’s on a boat or that she’s drunk. They are all symptoms of MS. She ticks so many of the boxes. We’re talking one to two years by the time a treatment plan is in place, during which time that demyelination in the brain will continue to wear away at the covers on her nerve cells – it’s more irreparable damage. Why can’t the government get back together and do something? Northern Ireland has one of the highest rates of MS in the UK, especially amongst women, and the Assembly aren’t even sitting. They are failing the people. We don’t want this publicity, but it has to be done.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said: “The patient is waiting for an urgent appointment at the MS Clinic where there is currently a five month waiting time. She will see a Consultant Neurologist specialising in Multiple Sclerosis at this clinic. The patient will not have to wait 12 months to see a Neurologist before that appointment.” \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"photographer thomas is the pride of belfast media group","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nAN intimate\n retrospective of photographs chronicling 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement is set to come under the spotlight at St Mary’s University College as part of Féile an Phobail’s 30th celebrations.\nDuring his 20-plus years as a photo journalist with the North Belfast News, Thomas McMullan has captured seminal photographs depicting the darkest days of the conflict, the “early mornings and even longer days of the peace process talks” and “the lighter moments during that period”.\nHaving always had an interest in “striking images” Thomas explained how it wasn’t until his early 20s that he picked up a camera hoping to “make a living out of it”.\n“I first started off with a wee magazine in Ardoyne called Horizon, it was a community magazine and it was there that I decided I want to make a career out of taking photographs. I really loved it and I would’ve tried to take photos out of anything newsworthy,” he said.\nThomas spoke of how he approached Andersonstown News founder Basil McLaughlin and Belfast Media Group managing director Máirtín Ó Muilleoir at their West Belfast offices, who after going through his portfolio “gave me a start and that was 20 years ago.”\n“At the North Belfast News we were capturing the moment of the peace process, it was a very fraught, fragile time,” he said.\n“We were talking to prominent republicans, loyalists, peacemakers at that time. I wanted the photos to reflect on why we were going through a peace process, why we were going through a struggle for peace.”\nThomas spoke of how trying to condense 20 years worth of work down to “15, 20 photo’s” was a tough ask. “It was extremely hard to whittle down the photos, you have to be critical of your own work but I got there,” he laughed.\nThe multiple recipient of NI Provincial Press Photographer of the Year says it will be a fantastic opportunity to see his work up alongside his fellow artists when the St Mary’s Visual Arts exhibition goes live on Thursday evening.\n“This is a piece of history for me coinciding with 30 years of Féile. I’m really looking forward to seeing all the other work. I was always a member of the Christian Brother’s camera club on the Antrim Road and owe them a lot.\n“I hope those who are coming will appreciate the work.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37184302.ece/7cf68/AUTOCROP/w140square/Belfast_Pride-006.jpg","title":"belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37188107.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Landing%20%202_Lewis.jpg","title":"belfast airport emergency declared on flybe flight plane lands with one engine","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup vows not to sponsor future lgbtq stormont events after disgraceful drag queen speech","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Michael Cooper/PA Wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReacting to the video, Mr Allister challenged the DUP over whether they would support similar events in future.\n\nMr Allister said: \"Before this event took place, I challenged the suitability of this speaker to address a gathering at Stormont given his track record. \n\n\"The speaker\u0027s repeated use of language which cannot be printed or broadcast underscore that those concerns were well-grounded. Given that sponsors are responsible for these events I would challenge those who facilitated it, particularly the DUP MLA and her party, to spell out why this event took place.\n\n\"The capacity of the speaker to act as he did on Saturday was well-known in advance.\n\n\"Why therefore did it go ahead and are the DUP happy to help facilitate similar events in future?\"\n\nIn response, the DUP said no one from the party would co-sponsor the event in future and that Paula Bradley had learned a \"salient lesson\".\n\nThe DUP said: \"Comments made at this event were disgraceful and not at all respectful. Paula Bradley co-sponsored the event without knowing many details about the event. She was not acting on behalf of the party and has learned a salient lesson. \n\n\"Neither Paula nor anyone else from the party would act as a co-sponsor for such an event in the future. The Assembly Commission may wish to review the event alongside the Assembly\u0027s protocols for using the building.\"\n\nDUP MLA Jim Wells, who had the party whip withdrawn following criticism of the leadership, said \"people will be horrified\" by Electra\u0027s behaviour and claimed she had \"done nothing but discredit the Assembly\" and her cause.\n\nEvent organiser Mal O\u0027Hara previously said he hoped to hold the event annually.\n\nHe said: \"The 22 speakers talked about their experiences as same-sex people.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"time drawing near for ireland border poll sinn feins mcdonald tells hunger strike event","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The march in Castlewellan was attended by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald.It marks the anniversary of the deaths of 10 republican hunger strikers, including Bobby Sands and Raymond McCreesh in 1981.In previous years tens of thousands of republicans have attended the event, which changes location annually.Relatives of IRA victims have accused Sinn Fein of \"insulting\" their loved ones memories, saying the commemoration compounds their grief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter, she continued, had a responsibility to take a lead on the process.\n\n\"Political leaders must begin practical preparations for a new, inclusive Ireland beyond partition,\" she added.\n\n\"We are entering a defining period in Irish political history.\n\n\"Change is coming and it must be managed, sensitively and imaginatively.\n\n\"A process of national reconciliation must be central to any genuine effort to unite the people of this island.\"\n\nAddressing the ongoing Brexit fallout, Ms McDonald said Remainers within the unionist community would be increasingly attracted to being part of a \"new and outward-looking Ireland\" as the UK continues to \"turn away from Europe\".\n\nShe also reiterated Sinn Fein\u0027s commitment to forging a united Ireland that would accommodate unionists and their culture.\n\n\"British identity can and must be accommodated in a united Ireland and I believe nationalist Ireland is open to constitutional and political safeguards to ensure this,\" insisted the party leader.\n\n\"The right of unionists to celebrate their history and tradition, to recount their experiences and suffering, and to remember and honour their dead must be, and will be, respected.\"\n\nAnd to claps and cheers, she added: \"Just as our right to remember, to commemorate and honour our dead will be respected.\"\n\nMs McDonald also stressed that the party would continue to build on its equality agenda in the event of Irish unity as she laid out Sinn Fein\u0027s vision.\n\n\"It will be an Ireland united and at peace with itself. It will be a successful, prosperous Ireland of opportunity for all, regardless of class, colour, religion, gender or sexual orientation,\" she told the crowd.\n\nReasserting her party\u0027s commitment to seeing the Executive and Assembly restored, Ms McDonald said the political stalemate could only be overcome if progress is made on a number of social issues, such as the extension of same-sex marriage legislation to the North, which the DUP is strongly against.\n\n\"Marriage equality, the right to inquests and language rights are for everyone,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Fifty years on from the civil rights movement, sections of political unionism still resist equality and rights, but they will not succeed.\n\n\"It is not sufficient for the two Governments to only call a talks process. They must bring something to the table. They need to make clear that agreements must be implemented in full.\"\n\nMs McDonald added that the DUP\u0027s \u0027confidence and supply\u0027 agreement with the Tories continued to be a sticking point in getting the Assembly\u0027s institutions restored.\n\n\"We are dealing with a British Government that is dependent on DUP votes and sees Ireland as collateral damage in their desire to remain in office,\" she added. \"That is why we need a strong Irish Government leading on these issues.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass.

officials, staff and media, at more than 40 venues, games villages and media centres, Olympic and company officials said.\n\nTokyo will be the first Olympic host to introduce the face recognition technology at all venues. \n\nThe system is expected to effectively eliminate entry with forged IDs, reduce congestion at accredited waiting lines and reduce athletes’ stress under hot weather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new system is put through its paces (Eugene Hoshiko/AP)\n\n\n\n\nTsuyoshi Iwashita, Tokyo 2020 executive director of security, said venues that are spread within and outside of the capital would be a big burden in achieving high levels of security.\n\n“By introducing the face recognition system, we hope to achieve high levels of safety, efficiency and smooth operation at security check points before entry,” he said.\n\nHe added that the system would contribute to a less stressful environment for athletes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll those accredited will be required to use the system (Eugene Hoshiko/AP)\n\n\n\n\nMr Iwashita said a test last year showed gate checks using the facial recognition was more than twice the pace of the conventional system using X-ray with visual siting by security guards.\n\nThe facial images of every accredited person for the Olympics and Paralympics will be collected after the approval process and stored in a database to be used to verify identities at accreditation check points.\n\nNEC says its biometric identification technology is used at airports and elsewhere in 70 countries, including Japan.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern california blazes now largest in state history","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

It killed two people, including a firefighter, and destroyed more than 1,000 buildings before being fully contained on January 12.\n\nHotter weather attributed to climate change is drying out vegetation, creating more intense fires that spread quickly from rural areas to city subdivisions, climate and fire experts say.\n\nBut they also blame cities and towns that are expanding housing into previously undeveloped areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe size of the fires surpasses a blaze last December in southern California (Jae C Hong/AP)\n\n\n\n\nMore than 14,000 firefighters are battling over a dozen major blazes throughout California, state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean said.\n\n“I can remember a couple of years ago when we saw 10 to 12,000 firefighters in the states of California, Oregon and Washington and never the 14,000 we see now,” he said.\n\nCrews did make progress over the weekend against one of the two blazes in the Mendocino Complex with help from water-dropping aircraft, Cal Fire operations chief Charlie Blankenheim said.\n\nBut the other one is growing after spreading into the Mendocino National Forest.\n\nThe complex of fire has been less destructive to property than some of the other wildfires in the state because it is mostly raging in remote areas.\n\nBut officials say the twin fires threaten 11,300 buildings and some new evacuations were ordered over the weekend as the flames spread.\n\n\n\n#WagnerFire\n [update] at Texas Hill Rd and Bondurant Mine Rd, east of Coulterville (Mariposa County) is now 22 acres and 98% contained. \npic.twitter/MPTeG0ex5r\n\n— CAL FIRE (@CAL_FIRE) \nAugust 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\nFarther north, crews gained ground against a deadly blaze that has destroyed more than 1,000 homes in and around Redding. It was nearly halfway contained, Cal Fire said.\n\nThe wildfire about 225 miles north of San Francisco started more than two weeks ago by sparks from the steel wheel of a towed-trailer’s flat tyre. It killed two firefighters and four residents and displaced more than 38,000 people.\n\nOfficials began allowing some residents to return to their neighbourhoods. But tens of thousands of others were still evacuated.\n\nThe fires in northern California have created such a haze of smoke in the Central Valley that Sacramento County health officials advised residents to avoid outdoor activities for the entire week.\n\n\n\n#CarrFire\n now covers more than 160,000 acres and is 43 percent contained. The costs of this fire have now exceeded $60 million. \npic.twitter/rZzBcDYQ4J\n\n— U.S. Forest Service (@forestservice) \nAugust 6, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAnother blaze that ignited last week has damaged a historic northern California resort in the Stanislaus National Forest.\n\nThe nearly century-old Dardanelle Resort has sustained massive structural damage, though the details were unclear, the Sacramento Bee newspaper reported.\n\nThe rustic lodge 180 miles east of San Francisco is nestled in the Sierra Nevada mountains and offers cabin and motel rentals, a store and restaurant.\n\nThe US Forest Service reported that the fire crossed a road on Sunday evening, forcing crews to retreat from the fire’s edge.\n\nThe resort owners said in a Facebook post that “at this point it has been confirmed that there is ‘massive structural damage’. We are heartbroken and struggling with this news.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"us reinstates economic sanctions on iran","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Speaking in a television interview, he also demanded compensation for decades of American “intervention” in the Islamic Republic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIranian president Hassan Rouhani struck a hard line as the US restored some sanctions that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal (Iranian Presidency Office via AP)\n\n\n\n\nMonths of uncertainty surrounding the sanctions have already further hurt Iran’s economy. The country’s rial currency has tanked, and the downturn has sparked protests across the nation.\n\nThe “Trump Administration wants the world to believe it’s concerned about the Iranian people,” Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a statement posted to Twitter.\n\nBut, he said, the reimposed sanctions would endanger “ordinary Iranians”.\n\n“US hypocrisy knows no bounds,” he said.\n\n\nTrump Administration wants the world to believe it\u0027s concerned about the Iranian people. Yet the very first sanctions it reimposed have canceled licenses for sales of 200+ passenger jets under absurd pretexts, endangering ordinary Iranians. US hypocrisy knows no bounds.\n— Javad Zarif (@JZarif) \nAugust 6, 2018\n\n\n\n\nUS officials insisted the American government stands with the people of Iran and supports many of their complaints against their own government.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton said Iran’s leadership is on “very shaky ground,” but he insisted economic pressure from the Trump administration is not an attempt at “regime change”.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said sanctions are an important pillar in US policy toward Iran and will remain in place until the Iranian government radically changes course.\n\n“They’ve got to behave like a normal country. That’s the ask. It’s pretty simple,” said Mr Pompeo, en route on Sunday from a three-nation trip to Southeast Asia.\n\n\nToday, the United States is taking action to reimpose nuclear-related sanctions with respect to Iran. \n\nFull statement from President Trump: \nhttps://t.co/tfDYCDyfDT\n\n— The White House (@WhiteHouse) \nAugust 6, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a firm foe of the Iranian government, said the sanctions symbolise “the determination to block Iran’s regional aggression as well as its continuous plans to arm itself with nuclear weapons”.\n\nHe called on the countries of Europe to join the US, saying, “The time has come to stop talking the time has come to do.”\n\nThe US has long designated Iran as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism, Mr Pompeo noted on Sunday, adding that the Islamic Republic cannot expect to be treated as an equal in the international community until it halts such activities.\n\nHe said that “there’s no evidence today of a change in their behaviour,” and in the meantime “we’re going to enforce the sanctions.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry republican report psni older peoples commissioner ongoing raids
