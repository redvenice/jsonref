Photograph: EPAAndy RainA British government minister has accepted that “further dialogue” is required with the Irish government over a controversial US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of proposed changes to immigration laws.During a debate in the House of Lords on Monday prior to a vote, the planned pre-travel clearance checks for those entering Northern Ireland were branded “unworkable”, with members urging the UK Lords Minister, Susan Williams (Baroness Williams of Trafford) to “make concessions”.Responding to criticism about lack of communication with the Irish Government and tourist chiefs, she said: “We do accept the need for further dialogue with interlocuters including the Irish government, Tourism Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland. I totally accept that point.”Last Tuesday, Westminster MPs voted to reinstate the proposal for an electronic waiver following an amendment by the House of Lords to exempt Northern Ireland from the new legislation. The day after the Commons challenge, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said as far as he was concerned, it had not been finalised. He described the decision as “regrettable”.Coming under the British government’s Nationalities and Borders Bill, the proposal will require EU citizens who are not Irish will to apply online for pre-travel clearance -known as Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - before entering the UK, including when crossing the Border into the North.Addressing the Lords on Monday after submitting an amendment, Paul Murphy (Baron Murphy of Torfaen) said he was “hopeful the Minister would have spoken to her colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office and would have made some concessions on this”. “But the dead hand of the Home Office is there again,” he added.The former Northern Ireland Secretary of State said he was “troubled” by the introduction of an ETA, at a cost of €14, saying it would severely impact on tourism, cross-border health services and the “spirit of the Good Friday Agreement” .“Is it really worth jeopardising our (BritishIrish) relationship which is bad enough as it is over the last number of years by this petty and silly proposal by the government...I hope the government will change its mind but I’m not hopeful.”The planned change to the law will also apply to citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) living in the State, which includes people from Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.Non-British or non-Irish citizens from other countries, outside the EUEEA, which previously did not require a visa to enter the UK, will now need an ETA.Former SDLP leader Margaret Richie also expressed her opposition, saying the ETA scheme was “unworkable”.“It is unenforceable and would violate the very premise of reconciliation in terms of the Good Friday Agreement,” she told the Lords.She asked the UK minister to “consider the geography” of Border towns and villages, saying: “I believe the Home Office hasn’t fully considered that.” “There’s one village that straddles both Donegal and Fermanagh, that is the small village of Pettigo where that Border goes straight down the middle.“Within one minute you could be in the Republic of Ireland and the next minute, you could be in Northern Ireland.” She queried what discussions had taken with the Irish Government as well tourism organisations.The human rights NGO, the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ), has also condemned the move, which it said was “unworkable and risks a hard border for many non-British and non-Irish citizens in Border communities who have been able to freely cross the Border to date”.Baroness Williams — who described herself as “an Irish woman with a father from Northern Ireland” — indicated however that the ETA plan was likely to be passed. “Once the EU’s come into force next year, Ireland will stand out as one of the few countries in Europe without an ETA style pass,” she said.Referring to tourism, she said that “once granted, an ETA will be valid for multiple trips to the UK”, and that the cost is “likely to be small and unlikely to be a deterrent for visitors”.“Moreover, many of the UK’s international partners have taken a similar approach to border security...It is a very familiar concept for travellers,” she added."},{"url":null,"title":"john callinan appointed as secretary general of department of taoiseach and government","story":"John Callinan photographed with then taoiseach Bertie Ahern in May 2008.

He has responsibility for dealing with Brexit, but his role has broadened in recent years, insiders say, and was the clear favourite to replace Mr Fraser.As second secretary general, Mr Callinan led the International and EU Affairs Division and the BritainNorthern Ireland Division, which has included the Shared Island Unit since 2020. Crucially, he was the Taoiseach’s “Sherpa” (as the senior EU adviser to EU heads of government are called), and he was particularly prominent during the Brexit negotiations, when he advised first Enda Kenny and then Leo Varadkar, and liaised with other EU “sherpas”. LeadershipAccording to an announcement released by the Department of the Taoiseach, Mr Callinan joined the Department in 1998, and has been a member of the department’s Management Board since he was appointed Assistant Secretary General in 2007. “He has worked closely with five successive Taoisigh and has held leadership positions across all major policy areas of the Department,” the statement said. Prior to joining the Taoiseach’s department, Mr Callinan worked in the Revenue Commissioners. He is a graduate of Trinity College Dublin, he also spent four years at the European Commission in Brussels, the Department said. His appointment signals the end of Mr Fraser’s leadership of the civil service, an era which ned the latter part of the financial crisis and the period of austerity which resulted from it, through the economic recovery, Brexit, Covid and now the war in Ukraine. A formidable manager and negotiator, Mr Fraser was regarded as an exceptionally powerful civil servant and he was heavily relied upon by successive Taoisigh. He is expected to take up his role as ambassador to the Court of St James (the UK) this summer.

This is totally bonkers.“There have always been daffs in the park. It used to be an old orchard and there must have been about 1,000 flowers.“Most of them have now been cut down.

The transfer was put on hold due to Covid - but the Mirror understands ministers plan to restart it this Spring. The Department for Work and Pensionswill start with a small number of Tax Credit claimants, up to a cap of , households. They then plan to remove the cap and move onto disability and other benefit claimants, to have everyone on the new six-in-one benefit by the end of . But the Social Security Advisory Committeewarned the change “creates a signicant risk” for benefit claimants, many of whom have “complex lives”.  It also creates risks for the DWP in delivering its plan, the committee warned. Chair Dr Stephen Brien warned there must be “independent oversight and scrutiny”. He announced he would be seeking further advice from experts over plans to lt the ,-household cap. Ministers insist Universal Credit is often more generous than old-style benefits, after they were repeatedly forced to reform it amid public anger and poor Brits turning to food banks. The six-week wait was cut to five, allowances for people in work were raised, and the amount given to debt repayments was cut. But campaigners point out some people could still be worse off. Anela Anwar, chief executive of anti-poverty charity ZK, said lting the , cap must get fresh approval in Parliament. She added: “It ensures DWP avoids a repeat of the shambolic early stages of Universal Credit, when many people were left without anything to live on for weeks or sometimes even months on end. “That resulted in MPs getting hundreds of complaints from desperate and angry constituents.”  Dr Brien was one of the original brains behind Universal Credit, and faced questions over his impartiality in  when he became SSAC chairman. He hit back at this at the time, insisting his work would be “evidence-based”. He told ministers on the latest change: “I can provide assurance that we do not wish to unduly delay the process. “We will not be undertaking a large-scale public consultation on this occasion but intend to seek the advice of a small number of experts, including those with signicant experience or expertise of agile processes and their governance.” But he added: “For the public to have confidence in this process and to minimise risk further consideration needs to be given to establishing appropriate independent oversight and scrutiny of the programme as it moves forward.” DWP Permanent Secretary Peter Schofield said in November that he was “determined” to see Universal Credit fully rolled out by December . He told MPs: “We got the funding in the spending review to finish this on time.” The benefit’s director general Neil Couling suggested the transfer would be a “slow, slow, slow experience”, adding: “You need to develop your processes and do that with small volumes.” A DWP spokesperson said: “Universal Credit is a modern dynamic benefit which supports people in and out of work. We have always been clear about our ambition to move people over from the legacy systems, which are complex, inefficient and based on aging, inflexible IT. “The Department will continue its regular engagement with the committee and our ambition remains to see the rollout of Universal Credit delivered safely and on time by .” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Yet the cash went to fewer than half of the  English areas that were eligible and told to apply.The funding is also much less than the ‘£bn bus revolution’ Boris Johnson promised a year ago. Once other commitments are added, it’s thought £.bn had been announced as of this week. Downing Street is understood to be in a tussle with the Treasury about getting the rest of the cash, with no guarantees it will be delivered. Read the full list of areas that got the cash - and that missed out. South Yorkshire’s Labour mayor Dan Jarvis said “we’ve been shafted” after his area asked for £m but got no BSIP cash - and his anger was matched by Tories.Conservative Don Mackenzie of North Yorkshire Council blasted: “We knew the Bus Back Better budget had been severely curtailed. “But I expected to get some money, not nothing at all, so Iaposm very disappointed.” The government claimed areas that failed to get the cash had not shown “sufficient ambition” with their improvement plans. But Shropshire Council said it had been praised for its “very strong bid” of nearly £m - only to get nothing. Its Conservative transport chief Cecilia Motley said she was “devastated”, adding: “We are at a complete loss as to why we have been completely overlooked.” Mr Mackenzie added: “I don’t think our plans lacked ambition, they were worth £ million over eight years.” BSIP improvements include making services more frequent and reliable, with cheaper fares and greener vehicles. In Cornwall, a trial starting on Sunday will see most fares cut.  Conservative Richard Smith of Suffolk County Council, which asked for £m, said: The funding we bid for would have given us a real opportunity to transform bus services in Suffolk. “It is disappointing but it should be remembered that this funding would have been over and above our existing budget of £.m.” Even areas that were successful got less than they asked for. Liverpool City Region asked for £million - and got £.million. Centre for Cities Chief Executive Andrew Carter welcomed the investment but warned: It is disappointing to see cuts to the National Bus Strategy funding, compared to what was promised last year. Several cities and city regions are getting a fraction of the money they applied for or, in some cases, nothing at all.Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh added: “The Conservatives have slashed the funding promised, and dramatically downgraded the ambitions of many local communities.“Far from bus transformation, many will continue to see managed decline.“Communities nationwide will be paying the price for these broken promises.” Other areas that missed out include Hull, Slough, Telford and Wrekin, Lincolnshire and Cheshire. Officials insisted seven areas with no BSIP cash were handed money from other pots, including for zero-emission buses. They include North Yorkshire, Blackpool, Leicester, Tees Valley and South Yorkshire. The £.bn was separate to £m for zero-emission buses, £m for mayoral city regions as part of other settlements, and £m on a better deal for bus users. The Department for Transport claimed nearly two-thirds of Englandaposs population outside London will benefit from new investment”, including earlier pledges. It added another £billion had been given to support bus and light rail services through the pandemic.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “Buses are the most popular way of getting around in this country – but for too long people outside of London have had a raw deal.“The investment we’re making today to ramp up the bus revolution will drive down fares at a time when people’s finances are tight and help connect communities across England.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The TreasuryConservative PartyDepartment for TransportGrant ShappsAndrew CarterRichard SmithBoris JohnsonDan JarvisPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On Thursday all of us spent the day desperately reading gas and electric meters, photographing them from seven angles and spent two hours trying to send the numbers to a crashed website, while we screamed and family members muttered “take six deep breaths and try again” because the next day the price was going up by two million per cent. Thanks to this sense of fun from companies such as EDF and E.On, from now on we can play this jolly game every year. It can become like searching for Easter eggs, and we’ll all laugh about the time Grandma didn’t quite get her reading in on time, bless her, so she spent the next month living in the sideboard clutching guinea pigs inside her nightie to keep warm.  In a few years, it will be a festival, like Halloween. Each March  one person will dress up as the EDF man and ­children will scream “aaaaagh don’t take our heating away”. People will run from house to house looking into cupboards with a torch, then we’ll all eat raw pizzas that we cannot afford to cook to celebrate ­Meter-reading Day. This has happened becausewe don’t have an exact reading from the moment the price goes up, the energy companies can charge us for everything at a higher rate. They’ve been given a licence to do whatever they fancy. Next week it will be announced: “Due to rocketing fuel prices, energy companies can marry one person from every household” and it will be considered a great honour to hand your sister over to Scottish Power.  The Government gives advice on how to “shop around” for cheaper tarfs, as it’s our responsibility to see which of the big six suppliers are slightly less impossibly expensive than the others. It’s like the police saying: “There have been a lot of robberies in this area lately, so we’ve decided to crack down. We’ve set up an app, so you can contact all the muggers in the area and arrange which one you would like to hold you at knepoint and run off with your bank card.” Because it’s all down to you. This is why you’ll find Government websites that give advice such as: “Save money on boiling water by filling a pan, and taking it to your local crematorium to pop it on the furnace during a funeral, so you enjoy a well-earned brew.”  The only people who aren’t told by the Government how to reduce energy costs are the energy companies who set the costs. I suppose there’s no point in ordering them about as they’re completely helpless. Since  they’ve paid £billion to their shareholders, but there’s nothing they can do to stop that. Their prices and profits just keep shooting up until eventually they’ll own the universe, and creatures from other galaxies will wonder why they have a bill for £ from British Gas. So all we can do is huddle around a candle with a raw fish finger to celebrate.

The official said: “Russia is redeploying elements of the forces that are in Georgia to reinforce the invasion of Ukraine. “We don’t think that this was planned, it’s a very odd thing for the Russian military to do. So we suspect it’s indicative of the problems they are having in Ukraine.” The order came five weeks into Russiaaposs invasion, which has run into fierce Ukrainian resistance. The issue of conscriptsapos involvement in the war is highly sensitive. On March , the defence ministry acknowledged that some had been sent to Ukraine after Putin had denied this on ious occasions, saying only professional soldiers and officers had been sent in, Reuters reported. Putinaposs spokesman said at the time that the president had ordered military prosecutors to investigate and punish the officials responsible for disobeying his instructions to exclude conscripts.  The annual spring military draft, which runs from April  to July , will affect Russian men between the ages of  and , Putinaposs decree said. Shoigu said on Tuesday that those called up would begin to be dispatched to their assigned bases in late May. Most military personnel will undergo professional training in training centres for three to five months. Let me emphasize that recruits will not be sent to any hot spots, he said in remarks published on his ministryaposs website. However, Mikhail Benyash, a lawyer representing several members of Russiaaposs National Guard who refused an order to go to Ukraine, said that under Russian law conscripts could be sent to fight after several months of training.US President Joe Biden today called for a war crimes trial against Putin, and said he was seeking more sanctions after the reported atrocities in Ukraine.Biden told reporters earlier today: “He is a war criminal.  “This guy is brutal, and what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone’s seen it. “I think it is a war crime ... He should be held accountable.” At the press conference, Biden added that he plans to hit Moscow with additional sanctions for its conduct throughout the war - which began with Putin sending troops over the border into Ukraine on February . The president said, Iaposll let you know, when asked about the nature of those sanctions. Shocking footage emerging from journalists in Ukraine showed charred bodies on a highway near Kyiv. Ukraine said  of some  bodies found in Bucha northwest of Kyiv were victims of extra-judicial killings by Russian troops. Satellite images showed a -foot-long trench dug into the grounds of a church where a mass grave was found. Ukraine called for an International Criminal Court investigation that France and Britain said they would support, and rights group Human Rights Watch said it had documented apparent war crimes. Russia said alleged crimes by its troops in Bucha were a provocation and no resident suffered. The UK has said Russia appears to be committing war crimes but has stopped short of describing the action as genocide, as it is called in Ukraine. That is because the UK sees genocide as something defined by a court of law. A Western official said the UK is “quite legally purist” about the situation. Western officials hope the International Criminal Court will be able to play the role of prosecuting war crimes in Ukraine. Officials are doubtful about the possibility of setting up a separate Nuremberg-style war crimes tribunal, called for by Gordon Brown. An official said that would require a UN Security Council resolution - which couldn’t get through because Russia has a veto.

Animal Welfare Assistant, Caroline Oram, said: When Moana and Tinkerbell first arrived in our care, it was clear that they had been through so much. They were so scared that they were trembling. We’d go to their kennel, and they’d huddle at the back and bark. “We had no idea what kind of le they had before to understand their needs.  Moana, a Yorkshire terrier and dachshund cross, was suffering with some hair loss, likely related to stress. She was particularly frightened and relied heavily on Tinkerbell for support. We wanted to get them into foster care as soon as possible, as they had been through so much, Caroline said. The pint-sized pair went to foster carer Christine Tilt, near Blue Cross Bromsgrove, and after just two weeks, they had already made a remarkable turnaround.  Speaking at Christine’s home on a visit, Caroline said: “The dference in them is amazing. Their coats are better, Moana’s fur is growing back and she’s more confident now in meeting people. They’re thriving now.” Tarzan and Jasmine were also placed into foster care in Southampton, and Ariel was fostered in Oxfordshire.

Alex Mahon, Channel  ’s chief executive, wrote: “We have been informed in the last hour that the government will shortly announce that the secretary of state has decided to proceed with the proposal to privatise Channel .The move has been met with widespread concern, with well-known stars flocking to give their verdict on the events.The decision to sell the organisation, first formed in , is the largest example of privatisation since the Post Office was flogged  years ago. The Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries, said that government ownership was holding Channel  back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.“A change of ownership will give Channel  the tools and freedom to flourish and thrive as a public service broadcaster long into the future,” she insisted. The move was described by shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell as “cultural vandalism”. What does the sell-off mean for Channel    Labour has stressed that the privatisation of Channel  could cause a “great deal of damage”. Ms Powell expressed concern over where the ownership of the broadcaster could end up. She said: “I fear that … rather than competing with some of the big US streaming giants, it is more likely to be bought by one of them. That will take money out of the UK economy, out of the creative industries and the independent sector that has so thrived under Channel . Conservative MP Julian Knight tweeted that he believed the move would give Channel  more independence and space to compete. He said: “It is certainly true that Channel  will have greater freedom to compete once privatised andmanaged well it should be able to continue to innovate and crucially appeal to young audiences - a real usp in today’s broadcast landscape.” The public broadcaster is already funded by adverts, and so it is unlikely that this will change as it does not currently receive money from the government or the licence fee. There are widespread concerns the move will harm independent production companies with close links to the provider. It is thought as many as  could be at risk of closing. In the past, the organisation has never been tasked with making money, with profit being put back into the creation of its content. According to the , analysts have claimed that the sale could see a % to % cut to its £m programming budget in an effort to get the brand into a more commercially focused position. This means that shows and content that donapost make much money are likely to face the chop. What does Channel  and its stars say about the sell-off   Channel  itself doesn’t appear to be best pleased with the news. A spokesperson said: With over , submissions to the government’s public consultation, it is disappointing that today’s announcement has been made without formally recognising the signicant public interest concerns which have been raised. In his email, Mahon set out that the organisation had been pleased with its work over the past  years and had hoped to have seen this continue in the same way over the next . The broadcaster has laid out plans to the government about how it could continue to thrive under government ownership and was maintaining optimism that the sale wasnapost yet a done deal. In a tweet, Location, Location, Location star Kirstie Allsopp said: “This is a load of utter twaddle! No true Conservative would sell Channel , Lady T will be spinning in her grave. C was set up to foster the British film  TV industry and it has done that job admirably. Any Tory MP who votes for this is a traitor to their party  country.”Sir David Attenborough suggested the move formed part of “shortsighted political and financial attacks” while Invictus Games medalist and Strictly Come Dancing star JJ Chalmers said: Genuinely, a piece of my heart just broke. @Channel is remarkable… and important… and… the list is [too] long.The fact that those who hold [its] fate in their hands don’t see [its] true value… is the saddest part. When will the Channel  sale happen   The actual move to privatise may take a little while, provided it can get through parliament. The proposal is due to be added to a draft Media Bill, which will then be included in the Queen’s Speech in May. The bill will need to get through both the House of Commons and the House of Lords before Channel  can be sold. Overall, the process could take as long as  months. In his email, Mahon said: There will now be a long process ahead – it could take  months or more for the required legislation to go through the House of Commons and then Lords. During that time, we’ll continue to work with DCMS and government, and with our supporters across the industry to make the arguments to ensure that Channel  can continue to deliver its remit. What other implications could there be from Channel aposs privatisation   Ms Powell stressed that the sale would be likely to harm people outside of London the most. She said: “I think it will cause a great deal of damage to jobs and opportunities in the creative industries, especially in Leeds and Bristol, and Manchester, and outside of London.”It has been noted that the money the government makes out of the sale would likely be spent on creative and independent production companies, which would in effect be putting money directly into its funding pot for the levelling up agenda.Dorries described the move as a “creative idend for all” as she claims the money would be put back into the creative sector. Who could buy Channel   At the time of writing, it seems the organisation most likely to purchase Channel  would be US-based Discovery, which is joining forces with WarnerMedia, the parent company of CNN and HBO. Channel  faced privatisation in , receiving interest from Discovery at the time. The broadcaster has been valued at £ billion.

They said trees between their properties in Renfrewshire, Scotland had ruined their enjoyment of their £, family home. It was also claimed that foliage from the trees had blocked drains and damaged their property. They applied to Renfrewshire Council to have the hedge cut down, but were left disappointed when the move was rejected. The couple then appealed the ruling to the Scottish Government who have now said the trees should be lopped to ft.  In an appeal document, the Shorts said: As the hedge has not been maintained by the owner for over  years, it has become massively overgrown in both height and width. Due to the height and width, professional tree surgeons would be required to maintain the hedge which now signicantly overhangs our property. There are also potential costs with damage to property with branches now growing near gutters and roofline. Allowing this hedge to keep growing will bring continued costs to us. We have tried to get this unmaintained hedge brought under control, through dialogue with the owner. Her own evidence confirms that she hasnapost touched the hedge for  years and her responses to us shows she has no desire to do the neighbourly thing. In dialogue with our neighbour and the council, we have always stated that we donapost want the hedge to be removed, we just requested for it to be brought under control to allow us to enjoy our space and right to sunlight into our garden and main living room.  They added: Another example is higher energy bills due to the lights and heating in the lounge having to be on more due to the poor light entering the front of the property. Documents sent to the council revealed Wylie did not think the trees caused any aposrestriction of the enjoymentapos on the Shorts garden. She also claimed that trees afforded her aposprivacyapos and provided aposenvironmental benefitapos to nesting birds and bats and added that the trees were present long before the Shorts property had been built. Rejecting the Shortsapos bid to have the trees lopped, Renfrewshire Council said: As a result of the position of the hedge in relation to the front garden, it is considered that the subject hedge does not result in a signicant adverse impact upon the reasonable enjoyment of the applicantaposs property, which would warrant the serving of a high hedge notice. But overturning the council decision, government reporter Trevor Croft said: During my site inspection I saw a signicant amount of overhanging of the appeal property by the hedge and given its proximity to the garden this would be impossible to avoid. Close to the hedge when standing on the driveway, and particularly when coming down the external stair, this could lead to an oppressive feeling. I allow the appeal and issue a high hedge notice. I have considered all the other matters raised but there are none which would lead me to alter my conclusions. Work on the trees must be carried out by September this year.

And as so often with the Tories, they talk tough on crime, only to go weak on the causes of it. Just look at the mess they have made of the Met.

Tragically, they both died – Armani in February and Tom last week.  But during that last year of Amani’s le, it was Tom who brought her the joy of true friendship. And when she died, Tom suffered the loss of a true friend too. Amani’s family have the comfort of knowing what a dference Tom made to her final days. The disease that killed them both was an aggressive brain cancer known as glioblastoma multorme. Tumours like it kill more children and adults than any other cancer, yet only % of research money is allocated to finding a cure.

But have you ever thought of smothering one in slow-roasted lamb, or serving it with salmon They might seem like quirky suggestions youaposd typically dismiss - but Tesco has created an inventive menu celebrating the teatime treat.You might think itaposs sacrilege to stray away from the classic spiced bun, in favour of flavours such as blueberry and bacon, but a visit to the cafe would prove you wrong. I visited the cafe for dinner along with Mirror writers Courtney Pochin and Zoe Forsey, and tried out a five-course tasting menu featuring dferent hot cross buns. The cafe is now open to the public, with a five-course meal setting you back £, with profits going to the Trussell Trust charity, helping it support people in crisis this Easter.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here  Steak Tartare served with fruity hot cross bun crostinis - washed down with a Hot Cross Bun Martini Reading that sentence, you might already feel like that is an overload of the humble Easter favourite. But it really works - the martini is essentially an espresso martini with some spiced cinnamon and chocolate added. Itaposs delicious and dangerously drinkable. I was more sceptical about the tartare but itaposs lovely - the fatty flavoursome meat well balanced by the sweetness of the crackers.  Smoked salmon with beetroot and hot cross bun croutons This ended up being my least favourite dish - but not for the reason you might expect. I love salmon and beetroot, and the croutons were lovely - but this was probably the dish that felt least influenced by the hot cross bun. The croutons were lovely but didnapost add much, thanks to the strong flavours of beetroot and salmon taking over.  Harissa roasted lamb shoulder and feta on an apple and cinnamon hot cross bun, alongside a Simnel Cake sour Delicious. It shouldnapost work but it does. The texture is lovely, with the slow-roasted meat complementing the toasted bun. The sweet bun packed with apple and cinnamon is a tasty contrast to the fragrant meat. I will be attempting to recreate this at home, so I can convince dubious friends and family that this is a winning combination Next time Iaposll try some crunchy pickles on top. The Simnel Cake sour is a winning replicate of the traditional fruit cake - tasting exactly of glacé cherries, and citrus peel, and naturally is served with a marzipan lemon on top.  Blueberry hot cross bun cannoli filled with lemon curd This will make any diner hoppy. The irresistible flavour of lemon curd, combined with fragrant blueberries and a hot cross bun, creates a beautul Easter dessert. I could have eaten ten more. Pleasingly the cannoli was lightly spiced and sweet, which really worked.  Saposmore served with salted caramel and chocolate hot cross bun Perfect for those with a sweet tooth - the crunchy chocolate cracker and marshmallows, drizzled in chocolate sauce is a winning end to a surprisingly fun meal.  .The cafe is now open for one week only and offers a range of menus to suit all ages – including brunch and afternoon tea. The café can be found at  Great Eastern St, London ECA EP and bookings can be made through the website OpenTable, though walk-in places are available. Tesco chief customer officer Alessandra Bellini said: The hot cross bun is very much having a moment in , as reflected by our focus on quality at an affordable price along with innovation in this year’s ranges. We wanted to make sure that this year’s was our best, but also go one step further and create a memorable Easter experience that allows hot cross bun lovers to enjoy our extensive offering in a iety of new and unexpected ways, while celebrating with family and friends.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Tesco\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Iris, a retired care worker, has been sharing their relationship journey on social media with fans, posting on Facebook just this week about how happy she was to be reunited with her husband after a month apart, reports the Sun. Writing on the , she said: Love is... Knowing you look like s**t after a days housework and gardening, without a scrap of make up on dressed in my scruff!After a monthaposs absence, my wonderful husband will welcome me just just the way I am, because thataposs what love is all about. Welcome home, Mohamed. Missing you this past month has made me realise what a priceless gem you are. This rough diamond of a we will be more appreciative of you in the future. But on the very same day they were back together in person, Mohamed posted a video from Cairo airport in Egypt explaining he needed to go back to the country for a special reason. Speaking in the video, he assured fans: I miss my we Iris, I miss her, and I miss my le with my we. Mohamed was finally granted a three-year visa on November  last year after the couple applied so he could then move in with Iris. Speaking to the Sunday Mirror last November, Iris shared how Mohamed rang her to tell her the good news while she was shopping.“There was a lot of happy shouting and screaming, she said. I cried in Tesco while sorting out my fruit and vegetables. “My tears were dripping on the apples. It was amazing.” When they were back in each otheraposs arms, she said: “We didn’t celebrate – we are just together and that’s celebration enough.  “We just had a cup of tea together. Mohamed is happy but he can’t say much at the moment.

Baby Dominic who is nicknamed Doodles, has  known allergens arising from a range of foods and materials such as latex, avocado, milk and beef. He also has breathing problems and neonatal absence syndrome following a morphine addiction because of hi mumaposs disability Staff at Astbury Lane Nursery in Congleton are aware of his health problems and work with his mum to keep him safe. So when a staff member saw a red blotch on his face, they leaped into action.  On Wednesday, Dominic started a new oral medication for an allergy-related skin condition. Just hours after his first dose, he began showing the first signs of a serious allergic reaction. Staff at Astbury Lane Nursery reacted quickly and contacted mum Kerri-Louise, who instructed them to give him allergy medication. They administered the treatment within minutes of the blotch being spotted. Kerri-Louise was called to the nursery after he developed an allergy and could see it was spreading.She told CheshireLive : “I could see straight away that his lips had started swelling, his eyes were puffy, lips were a deep red. I am relaying this back to the GP, I said, ‘He’s had his allergy medication but the symptoms do seem to have spread in the   minutes it has taken me to get there.’“He wasn’t at all fighting for his breath, he just had lots of shallow, quick breathing. The nursery staff, Gemma, had put his hand on his chest, and that is when I noticed his breathing.”  The GP told Kerri-Louise she needed to take baby Dominic to the hospital. Staff remained calm and helped Dominic into his mum’s car, who was planning on driving him to Macclesfield Hospital. “Dominic was kind of smiling but quiet. He wasn’t panicked in any way,” Kerri-Louise said. “Neither were the staff. Because I was on my own, the staff carried him to the car for me and strapped him into the car seat. After getting advice from husband Carl, she decided to call an ambulance to meet them at the house as fear increased of Dominic’s symptoms getting worse.He was starting to look more unwell and was becoming lethargic, and more red blotches and patches of eczema were appearing around his face. When an ambulance arrived, they checked him over and decided to take him to hospital to keep an eye on him as his allergy medication wears off. At just one year old, Dominic knows sign language. He has learned over  dferent signs since he was just two months old. Kerri-Louise explained that she was in a car accident at  which left her left leg paralysed and also resulted in spinal damage. She said: “He was born with a morphine addiction because of my disability. It’s neonatal abstinence syndrome, and when you go into withdrawal, your body shakes and you get angry because you need something that you can’t have. “My older sonhas the same thing. So we did sign language with the both of them because although they can’t speak, they can sign from six or seven months old. “Very handy ones have been ‘hurt’, ‘doctor’ and ‘medicine’. He can do animals and really fun ones as well like ‘monkey’ or ‘dog. But the main things we needed him to know were things like ‘medicine’, that would really help us.” While waiting for treatment, Dominic was signing that his head hurt, signalling to his parents that he possibly had a headache due to the reaction. Sign language is an important part of managing Dominic’s health, and the nursery have not shied away from embracing this. They have learned to understand some of the signs to help accommodate Dominic’s needs. Kerri-Louise said: “The nursery have learned sign language to be able to communicate with him as well. He’s probably been there about six months. He started in their baby room, and the baby staff learned sign language because he had been signing since he was about two months old.” Now Dominic has moved to the baby-toddler room with new staff who have embraced the language. His mum continued: “Within that room, he can actually sign a sentence, he can do two or three signs now. So unfortunately, theyhave got the harder job and they have to learn more signs to keep up with him.” Fortunately, due to the medication being administered so early on in the reaction, Dominic’s symptoms did not progress much further. He was discharged from hospital relatively quickly, and the doctor said that they were ‘lucky’ that the reaction had not been worse. Kerri-Louise said: “She was surprised that his throat didn’t close up on him, it could have been a full anaphylactic shock. But it wasn’t, the reaction paused at face swelling.” She is grateful that the staff were so quick in their reaction, especially nursery worker Olivia. The mum added: “She wasn’t tied with Dominic in any way. He wasn’t her responsibility. She’s gone out of her way to know… all his medication, all his health history. She got to know him that well that she could spot something so quickly and know it was serious. That just says everything about that nursery, they are a million miles ahead. They just treat them like family.” The reaction had the potential to be deadly, as it was completely out-of-the-blue and the symptoms were the “most serious”. But the staff at Astbury Lane Nurseryaposs actions saved baby ‘Doodles’’ le. Kerri-Louise explained that the nursery has been incredible with his allergies, and this incident is just a testament to their care and quality. She said: “When I mentioned his health problems, it was never a problem. Nothing is too much for this nursery, they have made something that was so so dficult at home, such a worry, they made it easy. “When he goes to nursery, I don’t worry, because I know for a fact that they will look after him.” It took a week for Dominic’s symptoms to subside, but the situation could have been a lot worse had the nursery not reacted so fast. Nursery Manager, Kate Smithers, said she is ‘proud’ of the team. She said: “After the girls noticed the mark on Dominic’s face, they instantly reacted by giving him the care and treatment needed. The team are incredible and the way they took control of the situation and knew that something wasn’t right, is a detriment to how seriously they take their role. “From the moment they noticed the mark, to the emergency medication being administered was literally a few minutes. Throughout, they remained calm, focused and worked together as a team to support one another, Dominic and also his mother, Kerri.

A statement said: “We have been working to protect the Omo Forest Reserve in Nigeria since  and this is one of the last remaining places in Nigeria where forest elephants still survive. “Visitors are therefore still helping protect elephants when they visit our zoo, even though we no longer have any here.” Last year – when there were  elephants in  zoos across the UK – it was reported that keeping elephants in zoos or safari parks would be phased out. Importation of new elephants would be prohibited and the existing population would be allowed to die out naturally. The news delighted campaigners who said that elephants, which are highly intelligent animals, suffer from mental illness in zoos.The RSPCA said it also causes them physical ailments such as crippling arthritis.They only live for an average of  years in captivity, compared with more than  years in the wild, where they live in large herds with highly complex social lives, and some travel hundreds of miles each year. It has been illegal for circuses to keep elephants since January . This legislation would bring an end to more than seven centuries of elephants being kept in captivity in this country.

His only real problem is that he is consistent at making bad choices, and perhaps in time the worst of all will be when he decidednotto relinquish his motheraposs hand at the Westminster Abbey memorial for his father, to let her be led to her seat by someone  as he quietly slipped into his own.Instead Andrew kept her hand, eyeballed the Dean of Westminster into backing down, and flaunted the Head of the Church of England in front of a bank of TV cameras in the full knowledge that his fatheraposs memorial would be reduced to a news item re-upping allegations of sexual abuse.Worse than the public criticism, though, was the well-briefed fury of Charles and William, the next two monarchs who will not be as forgiving as the current one. And then the entirely-coincidental revelation that Andrew had not mended his ways, and had become embroiled with another scandal.This time itaposs a court case in which he, his ex-we and both his daughters are alleged to have been the beneficiaries of a grand swindle. A Turkish banker allegedly persuaded a Turkish millionairess to trust her cash to him, and she has told the court that he used the money to buy influence for himself with the Royals.The Turkish banker was applauded at the princeaposs now-defunct Pitch@Palace initiative, and around the same time Andrew received £.m, his ex-we £,, and his daughter Eugenie a further £,.The millionairess says she was told the money was for a passport. Coutts says they were told it was to pay for Beatriceaposs wedding. This is despite the fact a passport costs £., and Beatrice married a millionaire.  Andrew has now repaid the £,, but a further £, is unaccounted for. The Duchess of York has refused toher chunk, on the grounds it was paid for her work as a brand ambassador for a green energy company, even though it does not seem to be benefitting much from the connection. Beatriceaposs friends have described her as completely unaware of how her wedding was paid for, while Eugenie has let it be known she spent the £, on a surprise birthday party for her mother.And the question must now be asked of the entire family: what is it about dodgy money that attracts you Becausea £, bill for a wedding was settled by a Turkish political exile, any other bride would know about it. If any other woman got six-figure sums from her ex-husbandaposs chums she might wonder why. Andany one of us wanted to throw a surprise party and found it cost the same as a new car, weaposd throw a smaller onewe didnapost have the means to pay for it. Now the Royal Family finds itself in the unenviable situation of having paid £.million between them to make a scandal go away, just as the Duke of York manages to drive them smack into a new one - one which makes them look entitled, opportunistic, and desperate for cash to supplement a lestyle they cannot afford.At a time when the rest of the nation knows to the nearest penny what they can afford, and are turning off the heating or adjusting their shopping habits to scrape by, the fact that the future Royal Family canapost imagine a wedding that costs less than three quarters of a million pounds is not going to improve its long-term chances of survival.The timing of this court case, which has rumbled on for a couple of years, suddenly being made public in the week after Andrew embarrassed his relatives is interesting. And it may be linked to the fact that the Duke, who just a few months ago confirmed his public appearance at the memorial would be the last, is now reportedly considering smearing his pudgy chops across the Derby, a Falklands anniversary event, and the Platinum Jubilee. Why would a man who vowed to step away from the spotlight now be so intent on hogging it  Read more Prince Andrew is a true pauper prince - a man of poor wit, poor talent, and poor judgement. All that makes him rich is his title, and after giving up every other honoric his HRH is the one thing he has held onto. He is not allowed to use it, but he does still have it.He also held on to his daughtersapos titles, when other siblings relinquished them in favour of a more normal le. He fought for his daughtersapos Royal security, when it was costing £m a year and creating bad news as Met police officers were forced to trail after two girls on their gap yahs. For all the criticism levelled at Harry and Meghan for trying to trade off their Royal titles, Andrew and Sarah of York have done exactly that for decades, and with far more disastrous consequences. It perhaps explains why sheaposs still Sarah of York. Whoaposd want to change their name,it would cost you the chance to earn £, without having to go down the pit  Having lost his reputation, his ski chalet, millions of pounds and the trust of most of his wider family, Andrew seems to be intent on reinventing himself - not as a changed or chastened man, but as a prince, who needs to show no humility or shame. With the Queen by his side, Andrew can try it. But he has underestimated two things. The first is the fury of the British public, which does not forgive sexual misconduct in public le that easily, still less so when it involves someone legally a child. And the second is the ruthlessness of monarchy - the one quality which has been passed through that family since William the Conqueror. Charles may go easy on his younger brother, but William seems to feel nothing but scorn for playboy princes with dubious means of financial support. There will not be space on William Vaposs balcony for Uncle Andrew, nor much patience with the York familyaposs inability to adjust their lestyle to suit their income. Andrew is therefore working against the clock -being a prince is what turns a buck, then how much of a prince can he be, in the time his mother has left  The answer must be: for as long as her family lets the Queen be so exploited.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Sarah FergusonPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On Saturday, a -word post about how he ed from the conflict as a changed man was posted to his ex-we Sarah Fergusonaposs Instagram account. Andrew, who reached a multimillion-pound out-of-court settlement in a civil sexual assault case a few weeks ago, flew missions as a Sea King helicopter pilot during the war, which was  years ago. His reflection appeared in three posts - which were removed after about two hours. Beneath the last post, it said it was written by HRH The Duke of York before the HRH was deleted.  The Queen stripped Andrew of his honorary military roles in January and he gave up his HRH style in a dramatic fallout from his civil sex case. And now, The Times reports that both Buckingham Palace and Andrewaposs team were both unaware his account had been published online and were blindsided by it.In the first Instagram post, Sarah wrote: I asked Andrew this morning for his reflections on the anniversary of his sailing from Portsmouth to the Falkland Islands  years ago. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. Andrewaposs account begins: As I sit here at my desk on this cold crisp spring morning thinking back to April  Iaposve tried to think what was going through my mind as we sailed out of Portsmouth lining the flight deck of HMS INVINCIBLE. The -year-old concluded: So whilst I think back to a day when a young man went to war, full of bravado, I ed a changed man. I put away childish things and  bravado and ed a man full in the knowledge of human frailty and suffering.  My reflection makes me think even harder and pray even more fervently for those in conflict today, for those familyaposstorn apart by the horrors they have witnessed.Like many royal watchers, author Robert Jobson was left baffled by Andrewaposs Falklands statement and is unsure what he hoped to achieve. He told The Mirror: I am not one of those who slam Prince Andrew because it is the latest - and perhaps easiest - media target. But the Duke of York’s bizarre decision to try to bolster his own image by waffling on about his Falklands war experiences on his ex-we’s Instagram account and also use the HRH title that has been stripped from him to sign off was an odd move. He continued: His ramblings about the Falklands - where we accept he fought with courage - shows how out of touch he is. He seems clueless about what people really think of him these days - a far cry from those days as the handsome and feted naval officer and pilot. It is unclearthis was a shameless comeback pitch or a last hurrah - by reminding people that he was once a war hero. But ato public le for the -year-old is not on the palace agenda and it won’t happen. Eventhe Queen has forgiven her favourite son, and believes in him, powerful figures in the palace corridors haven’t. Nor have the public.

They said: “Cherry eye is a common condition inherited in certain breeds of dog, and in rare cases, it can arise in cats. “Although unsightly, cherry eye doesn’t normally cause any discomfort to dogs or cats unless it is left untreated and complications occur.” But Mighty Midge wonapost have to suffer with cherry eye for much longer as vets will be correcting his condition when he is old enough to be neutered.

What we think is the Queen isnapost having health problems but mobility problems - she canapost stand for long periods or walk for long distances and therefore accommodations are being made. I think the palace are handling this very much as they did when the Duke of Edinburgh retired and he was able to say which engagements he did or didnapost want to attend at very short notice.In order for the Queen to attend her beloved husbandaposs memorial service last week, military-style plans were put in place to sweep her there in the most comfortable way possible. She was transported from Windsor Castle to Buckingham Palace in a Land Rover, where she then swapped into her State Bentley. The Bentley then made the short journey to the Abbey escorted by police outriders and parked outside the Abbeyaposs discreet Poetsapos Yard entrance, which has fewer steps and is a shorter distance to where she was to sit for the service. Other special arrangements put in place for the Queen’s comfort were the service limited to  minutes and the monarch sitting in one of the Canada chairs but with an additional cushion.

The renowned American portrait snapper says in the video: I think it will look better without the crown. It will look better, less dressy, Leibovitz adds. The Queen, who is posing in a fur cape and holding a scepter, laughs and says: Less dressy! What do you think this is   Unfortunately, the clip was edited to make it look like The Queen had stormed out of the room with two servants – but this didnapost happen at all. As later explained by Leibovitz herself, The Queen had been storming into the room and was nervous about the photoshoot. Viewers on TikTok were shocked by the frosty exchange and many believed The Queen should not have been asked to take off her crown. One said: Yeah… you don’t ask the queen to take off her crown.  A second joked: Who asks the queen to remove the crown. Off the tower methinks. Where is your protocol when talking to the queen  said a third outraged viewer. Someone  said: That was either brave or ignorant. I’m not sure which! Defending the photographer, another commented: I mean, Annie Leibovitz is well known for her stripped-back approach, weird choice for a royal portrait. I think she was brave to ask! Talking at her photography exhibition at the National Portrait gallery in , Leibovitz defended The Queen. She recalled: We were all very nervous. The Queen came down the hall and she looked a little perturbed. I knew something was up. All her dressers were about ft away. No one was near her. She was coming down the hall very purposefully.

Earlier this year, Andrew reached an out of court settlement with his accuser Virginia Giuffre in a civil sex claim filed in the US. It means that he avoided a potentially explosive trial with the settlement said to be £million. Andrew has continually denied the allegations against him. In January, he was stripped of his honorary military titles and patronages given to him by the Queen and it looked as though there was no way back for the Duke of York. But despite all this, the Mirroraposs royal editor Russell Myers has previously said that friends of Andrew say he still feels he has a lot to offer public le again. So do these signs below show he is trying to reinvent himself to play a more prominent role in the Royal Family Charity workJust months after Andrew put out a statement, approved by the Queen, that he would be quitting public le, he appeared on his ex-we Sarah Fergusonaposs Instagram account.A series of photos posted on her account in April  showed him putting together care packages for a local Windsor hospice.It led to criticism from royal biographer Tom Bower, who told MailOnline it was rather pathetic that heexploits the coronavirus crisis to creep back into the spotlight.However, fellow royal expert Richard Fitzwilliam did say at the time it was the sort of thing heought to be doing.Interview after Prince Philipaposs death Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. A year after this, the Queenaposs beloved husband and Andrewaposs father Prince Philip died at the age of  at Windsor Castle.In the aftermath of his death, Andrew was one of the first royals to publicly speak on camera about his fatheraposs passing.At a church service several days after Philipaposs death, Andrew said the monarch was feeling it more than everybody  but was remaining incredibly stoic, as he described his fatheraposs death as a terrible loss. It was his first public comment since his Newsnight interview - and just last week it was reported that members of the Royal household were left furious after Prince Andrew’s ‘completely inappropriate’ move right after Philip’s death. A source told the Mirror: “There is definitely a hand being played. “Hewas straight out the blocks in front of the cameras when the Duke of Edinburgh died, which was seen within the family as being completely inappropriate.Supporting victims In February, it was revealed that Andrew had reached a settlement in his civil sex claim.In a statement included in court documents, he expressed his regret at his association with Epstein and also vowed to support sex trafficking victims.It said: Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. “He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.” And speaking on True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, Mirror royal editor Russell Myers said this could have been Andrewaposs way of positioning himself for ato public le. He explained: “The language used in this [settlement] statement is that Prince Andrew will be helping sex trafficking victims. Is this him positioning himself to try and reinvent himself in the eyes of the public He added: “He is only , but it is impossible to see how he could have any future. His daughter Princess Eugenie founded and helped run a charity for victims of trafficking. Maybe he sees that as an avenue, because possibly his family are the only ones who think they can help him at this stage.” Philipaposs memorial One of the most high-profile events Andrew has attended in recent years is Prince Philipaposs memorial service, which took place last week at Westminster Abbey.It had been revealed in advance he would be attending the service in honour of his late father - and the order of service seemed to suggest he would arrive alongside his daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.However, he ended up taking on a prominent role at the event by walking into the Abbey with his mother the Queen and escorting her to her seat.It was later reported that the Queen defiantly overruled heirs Prince Charles and Prince William to allow her disgraced son Andrew to have a special role at the ceremony.The Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge “on more than one occasion” raised their concerns over the optics of allowing the shamed Duke of York to accompany his mother to the Westminster Abbey service last Tuesday. The future kings were “absolutely united” that it was “simply unnecessary” for Andrew to position himself as the only family member to escort the Queen to the church. But well placed sources have confirmed the -year-old monarch told them it was “her wish and final decision” that Andrew should chaperone her into the Abbey. Falklands War post  Meanwhile, this weekend, an account of Andrewaposs experience during the Falklands War was posted to his ex-we Fergieaposs Instagram account.Andrew flew missions as a Sea King helicopter pilot during the conflict and his reflection appeared in three posts - which were removed after about two hours. Beneath the last post, it said it was written by HRH The Duke of York before the HRH was deleted. The Queen stripped Andrew of his honorary military roles in January and he gave up his HRH style in a dramatic fallout from his civil sex case. At the time, a royal source said Andrew, who was born a HRH, will not use it in any official capacity. Like many royal watchers, author Robert Jobson was left baffled by Andrewaposs Falklands statement and is unsure what he hoped to achieve.  He tells The Mirror: I am not one of those who slam Prince Andrew because it is the latest - and perhaps easiest - media target. But the Duke of York’s bizarre decision to try to bolster his own image by waffling on about his Falklands war experiences on his ex-we’s Instagram account and also use the HRH title that has been stripped from him to sign off was an odd move. His ramblings about the Falklands - where we accept he fought with courage - shows how out of touch he is. He seems clueless about what people really think of him these days - a far cry from those days as the handsome and feted naval officer and pilot. It is unclearthis was a shameless comeback pitch or a last hurrah - by reminding people that he was once a war hero. But ato public le for the -year-old is not on the palace agenda and it won’t happen. Eventhe Queen has forgiven her favourite son, and believes in him, powerful figures in the palace corridors haven’t. Nor have the public. Derby Day appearance  Later this year a bumper four-day bank holiday weekend is planned for June with several events planned to celebrate the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee.One of those events is the Derby, where it is hoped the Queen will attend.And according to royal sources, Andrew will accompany his mother to the event and act as her chaperone.A source told the Sun: “He was meant to stay invisible during the Platinum Jubilee so there is no way he will be at events like Trooping the Colour. “But the Queen needs a chaperone on all occasions at the moment due to her mobility issues and Andrew has earmarked the Derby as the one he will accompany her at. “He just doesn’t seem to understand the public outcry.”Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyQueen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Border collie Ellie has been learning how to socialise with people after being trapped inside a ramshackle barn.The three-year-old dog was rescued by RSPCA workers from the hellhole along with  other dogs, in January last year.The pack of pups were riddled with parasites and struggling for food in Ceredigion, mid Wales.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Their owner agreed to work with the RSPCA when “the situation got out of control” meaning they couldn’t meet the dogs’ basic needs. It’s Ellie may have never even been outside, let alone interacted with humans before. But the poor pup has faced further heartbreak since, with her search for a forever home being unsuccessful. Ellie has spent more than  days searching for a new owner.  She is now one of RSPCA Cymru’s longest-staying dogs at their Bryn-y-Maen centre, along with five-year-old crossbreed Charlie, from the same rescue. Charlie was so terried when he was taken into the charity’s Newport centre that he spent the first six weeks of his stay cowering in the corner of his kennel. Bryn-y-Maen’s manager, Victoria Williams, said: “When Ellie arrived at the centre she was unsocialised and understandably nervous. “She’d been living rough in inappropriate conditions in a dilapidated outhouse with  other dogs and had never experienced a normal le, so we’ve worked really hard to build up her trust and confidence.  “For the first couple of months we’d sit outside her kennel and throw in high value treats for. “Once she was comfortable with that we fed her through the kennel bars before letting her out in the main block, leaving food bowls in dferent areas and gradually introducing more staff around her. “The next step was to get her used to a collar and a lead, and about three months after she arrived, she was finally ready to go for a walk. “It was really important not to rush Ellie and to let her do everything at her own pace. “We took in five other dogs from the same farm and whilst they have all been rehomed since, Ellie is still waiting. “She’s been with us a long time and has seen her friends from the barn all go off to new families, so we’d really love to see her settled and happy in her own home after everything she’s been through.” Ellie will need a quiet rural or semi rural environment with understanding owners who are going to be able to continue to build her confidence in an adult-only home as the only pet.

One Belfast school said children have been accessing the upsetting videos, which feature a razor-toothed monster from the video game Poppy Playtime, through YouTube and TikTok. One clip shows the creepy Huggy Wuggy singing about hugging and killing and asking viewers to take their last breath - and itaposs worrying parents whose children have been copying the video while in the school playground, reports Belfast Live.Cregagh Primary School in East Belfast warned parents of the trend and asked them to be vigilant around what children are watching.  In a post on the schoolaposs Facebook page, principal David Hegarty said: It has been brought to my attention that a character named aposHuggy Wuggyapos is being viewed by our children online, some as young as Primary One. The character can be easily viewed on YouTube channels and is a teddy bear with razor sharp teeth that sings worrying songs about hugging and killing.On one of the videos the bear asks the viewer to take their last breath. It is a very deceiving characters, as hugs should be seen as something kind and loving, and because of its name is able to infiltrate firewalls and filters. I just wanted to inform parents so you are aware and can be vigilant around what your children could be watching.The same post was also shared to the Facebook page of Abbotaposs Cross Primary School in Newtownabbey.

This has included objects moving around on their own and eerie shadowy figures appearing from the darkness. However, one incident, in particular, has scared her more than any of the others.After setting up a CCTV camera in her basement, Kathy, from Quinte West, Ontario, Canada, captured footage of what appears to be a black mass chasing her petried cat, Salem, after emerging from her motheraposs old s doll.The video shows three-year-old Salem staring in the direction of the doll prior to the black mist emerging, looking to be in visible distress. The mass then drts towards him, causing him to flee in apparent terror. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Kathy, who works as a call centre operator, says she has become used to the spooky goings-on at her home scaring the le out of her, and claims sheaposs even avoided going down into the basement by herself at all costs. Some have suggested that the family had digitally edited the chilling footage, but Kathy states that they work hard to debunk anything captured on CCTV, and is insistent that the footage is real. Kathy explained: My husband and I were really freaked out. I immediately called my psychic medium friend and she made me feel a little better because she said she wasnapost getting any vibes where itaposs something thataposs out to get us, itaposs just something that wants its presence known. I think my house must be haunted. I love this house. The only way weaposd consider moving wasit became violent oranything was to harm any of us, of course. But as it stands right now, other than a few things moving and just scaring the le out of us, weaposve become used to it really. The mum-of-one says her daughter Jayden Carveth, , was the one to convince her to share the ghostly goings-on at her house via TikTok, where she has since clocked up more than , followers and likes.Kathy said: My TikTok followers asked to put the camera in with the dolls overnight in the basement as thataposs where most of the activity is. The cat was down there and my daughteraposs bedroom is down there and she said the cat ran to her door. She heard him outside and let him in and he was clearly afraid of something. She said aposmum, you might want to check those cameras because the cataposs crazy scaredapos.  She continued: The next day we checked the cameras and what I saw was my cat staring at these dolls clearly frightened of something and then all of a sudden a black mass or mist formed from one of the dolls. I think it could be a ghost. Salem is my protector. That cat goes everywhere with me soI do have to go downstairs and Iaposm nervous, he follows me. Itaposs uncommon for him to show signs of being afraid like that. Kathy says a psychic told her that the paranormal activity is connected to an incident that happened back in the s after a group of teenagers possibly used a ouija board at the house. A week or two can go by without any happenings. However, over the course of the last fortnight. the house is said to have become aposvery activeapos, which a friend suggested could be on account of the upcoming Easter holiday.Kathy added: We started noticing little things right away when we moved in. Iaposd get up in the morning and two or three kitchen cupboards would be open and back then we didnapost even have security cameras set up and Iaposd blame my husband and would be like aposyou got up in the night and didnapost shut these cabinetsapos and he was like aposno I wasnapost up in the nightapos. Or Iaposd look for my hairbrush which I keep in the upstairs bathroom and find it in our basement and my daughter was like aposI didnapost take the brush down thereapos. It wasnapost until one night we were sitting in our bedroom, I was reading a book and my closet doors started opening and closing by themselves. Thataposs when my husband was like aposok, something weird is going on hereapos. Weaposve lived here four years and had a lot of spooky stuff happen and weaposve seen a lot of scary stuff - shadows figures even, but nothing has ever physically touched or harmed us.Do you have a ghost-related story to share  We pay for stories.

Thankfully Dakota was able to find a professional who could fix the mess and give her the dream extensions sheaposd wanted all along. She added: My new lash tech who was so gentle and kind and patient - it took her  minutes with the solution and whatever to get those things off my eyes. She saved my eyelashes -Iaposd have kept them on any longer I probably wouldnapost have any eyelashes left. For some miraculous reason my eyelashes werenapost damaged, she put. anew set on and they are so nice and honestly, thataposs what I was going for - I didnapost want to look like f***ing Eugene Levy. Dakota finished the video by sharing that she had tried to complain to the original woman, but had been blocked. She went on to advise others to do their research before getting extensions.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Jamie, , tried to whip out his camera to get a photo of the beast but it ducked under the surface before he got the chance to get a picture.Warren and Jamieaposs sighting is the second time Nessie has been spotted this year, as an aposexpertapos recorded an official sighting after spotting apostwo objects moving parallel to each otherapos.What do you think about the Loch Ness Monster  Let us know in the comments...Producer and filmmaker Warren, of Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Northumberland, said: Unbelievable as this sounds, me and Jamie saw something very large in the loch. I saw something like a very large upturned boat out of the corner of my eye about m away from the shoreline, then Jamie shouted stop. He saw it fully and said it looked like a very dark whale - a hump. By the time I stopped the car, a few metres later, trees were covering our view, I quickly reversed, Jamie jumped out.  But all he got on his phone camera were very large circular ripples, but in the exact spot the aposcreatureapos had been. And as we watched it looked like ‘it’ was moving away from us underwater before totally disappearing a few moments later. If we had arrived literally  seconds earlier, we would have caught this properly on camera. We were absolutely gutted that we missed what would have been a genuinely historic picture. “But also amazed at what we had both seen as we were both very sceptical about previous sightings.  As we are actually here in Loch Ness filming a documentary on all of the strange occurrences in the area, we expect ridicule and disbelief but we both know exactly what we saw. Nessie hunter Steve Feltham, who we met later in the day, agreed our experience sounded and looked like a genuine sighting similar to others over the years. And Jamie has logged it with the Register of Nessie sightings. Jamie, of Gateshead, added: I looked towards then cemetery and then the large object or creature in the loch caught my eye. At first I thought it was a big boulder or something, I said to my friend driving ‘Whataposs that itaposs huge ’ The object creature was reflecting the water so looked wet, almost like a whale skin crossed with a fish skin, it was dark in colour - darker than the water surrounding it.

There were dark greys, black, browns in colour, it almost looked like how a whale hump might look breaking the surface minus the fin. There was a definite movement but didnapost see too much of the movement before trees obscured it, it was a very big size at least  foot long, maybe bigger, around the middle of the loch. The earliest sighting of the monster was recorded by Saint Columba in . But Nessiemania really took hold in  when George Spicer and his we claimed a ft-long beast crossed the road in front of his car. A year later, the famous surgeonaposs photograph appeared to show Nessieaposs head and neck poking out of the water. It is now believed to be a hoax.

I assumed it was just a bit of lockdown weight, and it was nothing too noticeable. “I’d flown on a plane a month before, and even had an x-ray after a rugby injury six weeks before I gave birth. There was no part of me that thought I could be expecting - to be sure I even took a test a month before giving birth and it came back negative. “The evening before he was born, I just felt a bit yuck. My stomach felt a bit off, so I put the kids to bed and got an early night myself.“I woke up around am and felt so uncomfortable. It was like I really needed the toilet, but I wasn’t able to go. “The pain started to get worse, so I decided to have a shower to make myself feel better. “I didn’t want to wake my husband, so I kept the light off and showered in the dark. “I felt a sudden urge to push, and the next thing I knew, I was holding a baby’s head.” In a state of shock and confusion, Dimitty managed to sit down on the floor in the dark, and after a final push, her baby was born in the early hours of February th .She called for her husband, Jason, who rushed into the bathroom and was shocked to find his we cradling their newborn son.

They were both over the moon. “It was such a huge shock that the first few days are a bit of a blur,” Dimitty said. “My older kids were so excited when we told them, particularly my daughter as she’s always wanted to be a big sister. She’s so caring and has taken on her new role really well. “Our family and friends have all been so supportive as we weren’t prepared at all – in fact we’d thrown away all our old baby stuff a month before. “But everyone came together to make sure we had a pram, clothes, nappies, and a bed for him. “It took us about  hours to come up with a name for him, but we chose Harvey after Jason’s grandfather, which is really special. “My other two pregnancies were so dferent so I never thought something like this could happen to me. Itaposs taken my brain and body a bit of time to process whataposs happened, but we are finding our feet and feeling more settled now. “He’s such an amazing baby and we feel so lucky to have him join the family, evenit was quite a shock at first.” Her husband Jason added: Heaposs a precious little man but it was the biggest shock of my le.

She hoped it would apostake some years offapos and she had the treatment done before parentaposs evening at her -year-old sonaposs school. But after the treatment Mariana, from Northampton, East Midlands, took a turn for the worse and her face swelled up - and when she went to the school her son couldnapost recognise her. What do you think of the treatment  Let us know in the comments...Mariana, from Northampton, East Midlands, said: I wanted to take a couple of years off, hoping Iaposd look like I was turning  instead of . Iaposve got really droopy eyelids on the top and they literally hang on my eyelashes and I can see it - so itaposs not just looking at it, it literally annoys me for my vision. Iaposve also got excess skin and dark circles under my eyes so I was hoping that would help tighten the skin a little bit because itaposs dficult to put make-up on because thereaposs so much skin.Right after I just had red skin and little dots but when I woke up the next morning it was really, really swollen. On the second day I woke up it was super swollen everywhere - top and bottom - and then as the day progressed and the next day the swelling stayed but then my eyes became quite droopy as well. I knew what I was expecting but it was still a shock waking up and realising aposIaposve got to go to parentsapos evening and face my childaposs teachers looking like thatapos.  The teachers asked meI had an allergic reaction and I said aposno Iaposm just trying to look youngerapos. The mum-of-four says she couldnapost help but laugh about her extremely swollen eyes and having to face the teachers on parentsapos evening just one day after the appointment. Most of her family also found it funny, but she says her -year-old son seemed to uncover an unknown phobia, with the sight of the burnt dots around her eyes made him feel aposuncomfortableapos.

This left the teen unable to be in the same room as his mum for a few days and still unable to look at her face on Motheraposs Day. Mariana said: My family thought it was really funny but my son must have a fear of holes or something because he literally couldnapost even look at me or be in the same room as me. It made him feel really uncomfortable and it was funny because it was Motheraposs Day on Sunday and he was worried about how he was going to spend it with me, looking like that. Luckily some of the spots had gone by then and he could at least be in the same room as me evenhe couldnapost look at me. The anti-ageing treatment works by targeting the collagen and protein-producing cells in the skin, stimulating them and causing the area to tighten up. The hot current creates small holes in the skin’s layer which have to be allowed to heal properly to avoid complications like scarring and pigmentation.

Frank has been hand reared by farmer, Libbie Harris, , from Bristol, since he was born, as his mother didnapost have enough milk to feed him. But with two other lambs to feed, Libbie decided to teach Ted how to muck in - and he couldnapost be a cuter helping hand. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. In the video, Ted can be seen on his best behaviour, holding the bottle in the perfect spot while Frank tucks into his milk. Libbie explained: Ted is trained as a gun dog so he learnt how to pick things up with his mouth. I have to feed the lambs three times a day and realised I needed some help. Ted usually picks up pheasants when we go shooting so I thought I’d give it a go. He was able to hold the bottle straight away butit’s full its a bit too heavy. Now I give him the bottle to hold when it’s half empty then I can feed the other two at the same time. It is handy having extra help! The clever seven-year-old Lab has taken on the father role at the farm, and Libbie coins herself a apossurrogate mumapos to the orphaned lambs. She adds: I have eight working dogs but Ted is the most relaxed of the bunch. He likes to chill out and Frank will usually skip around him. I have hand reared Frank who is also known as fragile Frank as he was pretty weak when he was born. His mum had two lambs but not enough milk to feed them so it was better for his chance of survival to be hand reared. He is now thriving and loving le with his friend Ted.Ted isnapost the only farm dog going above and beyond to help orphaned animals - rescue dog Snow has become best friends with the foster calves.From playing to sleeping, eating and even snuggling, thereaposs absolutely nothing Snow wonapost do to stop the sweet baby cows from feeling sad and alone. Owner Krysten Pierre, , from Victoria, Australia, said: Part of me thinks that because Snow was orphaned and moved from home to home too, he kind of understands how the cows feel.Do you have a dog story to tell  Contact nia.dalton@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsAnimalsPregnancy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes after the Tesla and SpaceX chief purchased a . per cent stake - worth billion- in Twitter Inc yesterday. Prior to announcing the purchase, Musk had criticised the micro-blogging site for failing to adhere to free speech principles and said he was contemplating building a new social media . But now the -year-old businessman cannot become the owner of more than .% of Twitteraposs common stock either as an inidual shareholder or a member of a group as long as he is a director of the brand, according to a company filing made today. Twitter Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal - who Musk previously ridiculed - said: Iaposm excited to share that weaposre appointing @elonmusk to our board.  In a tweet he added: Heaposs both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on @Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long-term. In response, Musk tweeted: Looking forward to working with Parag  Twitter board to make signicant improvements to Twitter in coming months. He recently ran a Twitter poll asking usersthey believed the  adheres to the principle of free speech. After disclosing his stake on Monday, Musk put out another poll on Twitter asking usersthey want an edit button, a long-awaited feature on which the social media  has been working. You can never underestimate Elon Musk. I wonder what the underlying motives are  said Gerald Goldberg, CEO of GYL Financial Synergies, a registered investment adviser, whose clients own both Twitter and Tesla shares. I think heaposs sending a message to the SEC that says, aposIaposm going to do what I want to doapos.  On Monday, Musk disclosed his ownership of . million Twitter shares, which are held by the Elon Musk Revocable Trust, of which he is the sole trustee. Musk will participate in the director benefits arrangements applicable to non-employee directors, the company said. Twitter will enter into its standard form of indemnication agreement with Musk, it added. Musk will serve as a Class II director, with the term expiring at Twitteraposs  annual meeting of stockholders. Twitter shares surged six per cent in trading before the opening bell, after closing up over  per cent on Monday.  The South African-Canadian entrepreneur - who in recent months has seen his wealth overtake Amazon founder Jeff Bezos - has said he is a free speech absolutist. He has been vocal against Web, a term for a utopian version of the internet that is decentralised and whose commercial backbone is the non-fungible token . Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Musk, though active proponents of cryptocurrencies, share skepticism around the metaverse, NFTs and Web, what some deem to be the evolution of the internet. Musk has previously called NFT profile pictures annoying. The worldaposs richest man will also be a board member of UFC-owner Endeavor until June  but has exited the board of tech non-profit OpenAI, which he co-founded, in . He is also the founder and CEO of SpaceX, and leads brain-chip startup Neuralink and infrastructure firm the Boring Company.

Honest media outlets have been shut down, and protests against the war cracked down upon with speed and severity. So the Russian people from Moscow in the west to Yakutsk in the east, from Archangel in the far north Arctic Circle to Irkutsk down south near the Mongolian border have no idea of what is really happening in Ukraine. Since the Russian invaded Ukraine on February , many Mirror readers have been asking what they can do to help. And while many have kindly donated to the Disasters Emergency Committee: Ukraine Appeal and offered to take desperate Ukrainian refugees into your own homes, it still does not feel like enough. Дорогой русский друг,Мы пишем тебе, потому что хотим, чтобы ты знал правду о войне на Украине.Великобритания — друг российского народа. Мы играем с вашими футбольными командами и пьем русскую водку. Мы знаем, что вы хорошие люди, которые хотят жить в мире и видеть, как ваши дети растут счастливыми, здоровыми и заботятся о других.Но мы также знаем, что в России нет свободной прессы, и вас ежедневно кормят ложью о войне в Украине.Поэтому вы можете не знать, что тысячи невинных людей, включая женщин и детей, подвергаются резне. Или что российские войска ушли из Киева, оставив свидетельства казней многих гражданских лиц. Некоторым стреляли в спину, когда они были связаны по рукам и ногам. Нам также очень жаль говорить вам, что женщины подвергались насилию, иногда на глазах у своих же детей.Мы знаем, что ваших сыновей, братьев и парней против их воли призывают воевать на Украине. К сожалению, жизни многих ваших молодых людей уже потеряны, и мы глубоко опечалены скорбью из-за этой ужасной войны.Пожалуйста, поверьте, что эта война, начатая Владимиром Путиным, незаконна, и её осудила уже  страна мира. Ваш президент врёт, когда говорит, что Украина представляет угрозу для России и полна нацистов.Если вы не можете или не хотите верить тому, что мы пишем, тогда, пожалуйста, хотя бы задайте себе вопросы, которые должны таиться в вашей душе. Почему ваш президент заставил замолчать свободную прессу  Почему ваших молодых людей посылают на смерть  Кому выгодна эта война Мы уверены, что вы, как и мы, не хотите, чтобы гибли люди, чтобы дети росли сиротами, чтобы семьи разрывались на части.Мы призываем вас быть на стороне дружбы между народами.Во имя мира,Читатели Daily Mirror So today we are printing a letter written in Russian which you can send to ordinary Russians to enlighten them of the truth and hopefully begin to combat President Vladimir Putin ’s lies.Our letter says: “We know you are good people who want to live in peace and watch your children grow up to be happy, healthy and care about others.But we also know there is no free press in Russia and your leaders are cheating you with a daily diet of lies about the war in Ukraine. Your President is not telling the truth.” The Russian people are not even aware of the heavy losses their own forces - their own sons, brothers, fathers and uncles - have suffered in this evil conflict. Cut out our letter in Russian, pop it in an envelope and address it. Russian addresses can be found on a random address generator at: www.bestrandoms random-address-in-ru  If you do not have the internet, maybe try your local library or ask a friend to help. Posting a letter to Russia costs from £. - and it may begin to change hearts and minds among ordinary Russians who have done no wrong but are simply led by a psychopathic dictator.Dear our Russian friendsWe are writing to you because we want you to know the truth about the war in Ukraine. Britain is a friend of the Russian people. We play against your football teams and drink Russian vodka. We know you are good people who want to live in peace and watch your children grow up to be happy, healthy and care about others. But we also know there is no free press in Russia and your leaders are cheating you with a daily diet of lies about the war in Ukraine. So you may not be aware thousands of innocent people, including women and children, are being slaughtered. Or that Russian forces have withdrawn from Kyiv, leaving evidence they executed many civilians, some shot in the back while tied hand and foot. We are also very sorry to tell you women were raped, sometimes in front of their children.  We know your sons, brothers and boyfriends are being conscripted against their will to fight in Ukraine. Sadly the lives of many of your young men have been lost already and we feel sorrow for all those mourning because of this terrible war. Please believe us when we tell you this is an illegal war by Vladimir Putin that has been condemned by  countries around the world. Your President is not telling the truth when he says Ukraine is a threat to Russia and full of Nazis. If you cannot or will not believe what we write please, at least, ask yourself the questions that must lurk in your soul. Why has your President silenced the free press  Why are your young men being sent to their deaths  Who benefits from this war  Like us, we are sure you do not want to see more people die, more children grow up orphaned, more families torn apart. We urge you to be on the side of friendship between nations.

Officials have written to Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney asking the Government to intervene before they run out.Sources told The Irish Mirror that the department would not be stepping in. In a letter seen by the Irish Mirror, Russian Embassy staff – ironically one of the world’s biggest oil exporters before the Ukraine invasion – have requested Foreign Affairs “intervenes into this clearly discriminatory case”.A source said: “The embassy is struggling because no one wants to do business with them as a result of whataposs happening in Ukraine. It’s not only some oil companies they’re having issues with, it’s banks too and many more businesses.” The Irish Mirror also understands that Bank of Ireland has decided to suspend their accounts with the Russian Embassy in Ireland, according to senior sources.When contacted, a spokesman for Bank of Ireland said the firm can’t comment on any inidual account. It’s understood the embassy also had both its boiler contract and fuel card account ended by separate companies. A second source said: “The Department of Foreign Affairs wouldn’t be stepping in to get anyone anything.” The letter sent by the embassy on March  reads: “The current provider of fuel to the Embassy has refused to deliver diesel to our mission. “The Embassy checked other providers in [the] Dublin area for the availability of diesel supplies, but they have all refused to cooperate. The Embassy is left with a very limited supply that will last till the end of the week only.  “This diesel is an essential commodity, since it is used for heating and hot water supply of the Chancery, as well as the residential area of our mission. The Embassy requests that the Department intervenes into this clearly discriminatory case.”When contacted by the Irish Mirror, the Russian Embassy refused to sayit had since secured fuel.The Russian Ambassador’s press secretary, Nikita Isakin, said: “The Embassy does not disclose the details of its communications with the Department or any other third party.” A Department spokesman said: “The department doesn’t comment on the operation of embassies.” The Russian Embassy has also expressed to the Department of Foreign Affairs that Russian people living in Ireland feel unsafe and discriminated against as a result of the war in Ukraine.

It comes as mounting evidence of war crimes committed by Russian forces in the city near capital Kyiv will be discussed by a United Nations Security Council today. The Ukrainian President - who was seen holding back tears as he visited the aftermath on Monday - will address the council, which is pushing to ensure justice is done. Volodymyr Zelensky surveyed the alleged atrocities near capital Kyiv, describing the discovery of raped women and murdered children among the dead. He was accompanied by defending servicemen after invading troops had retreated from the area. US President Joe Biden called for Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin to face a war crimes trial, adding he is now seeking further sanctions against Russia. This guy is brutal and whataposs happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyoneaposs seen it, he said in an impassioned speech last night.  Ukrainian officials have vowed to hunt down the butchers of Bucha after hundreds of dead civilians were discovered. Kyiv intelligence sources have named Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - who leads the th Separate Motorised Rle Brigade which occupied the region - as the commander in the area. Growing evidence points to barbarism in Bucha with local women and children raped and shot and demands are growing for accountability over atrocities by Vladimir Putinaposs forces. Zelensky has warned that worse evidence of mass killings of civilians by Moscow will emerge as the Russian president repositions his troops to the south-east.  It will be his first address to the Security Council, whose presidency is held by the UK, with members including Russia and China. The Ukrainian leader accused Moscow of committing real genocide, as he appeared visibly emotional, flanked by his soldiers and wearing a bullet-proof vest. Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of the office of the President of Ukraine, said Mr Zelensky will give all the evidence to the international community at the Security Council meeting. If these awful atrocities will not change the agenda of all the world, what will change  the adviser asked on BBC Radio aposs Today programme. Mr Zhovkva said Ukraine needs additional weapons, including tanks and missiles, to liberate more cities from Russia control. Dame Barbara Woodward, Britainaposs UN ambassador, called images coming from Bucha harrowing, appalling, probable evidence of war crimes and possibly a genocide. She cited hundreds of bodies being dumped in the streets or in mass graves and allegations of rape. Ukrainian reporter Evgeny Spirin said: “Some of the killed children had their arms tied up. Children…. They were tying up children. There were shot dogs.  He added: “Irpen, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with this, and is it worth living at all  How do I explain this to myself, how  “They must cease to exist. They must all be destroyed, each and every one of them, turned into dust, into mud, into clay, all of them.”Ukrainian activists and web sleuths have identied the presence of Omurbekov’s forces - which are normally based in the far east of Russia - and a number of other Russian military units. Volunteers group Tretya Sila reported: In Bucha there was a military unit  from the village of Knyaze-Volkonskoye, Khabarovsk region... “Soon all these murderers, rapists and looters will be known by name. InformNapalm volunteers named Omurbekov as unit  of the th Separate Motorized Rle Brigade amid suspicions of grotesque war crimes in Bucha.  In the city, too, according to the Ukrainians, were forces from the Fth Separate Guards Tank Brigade of th army of the Russian Eastern military district, the st Parachute Assault Regiment of th airborne ision, the th Parachute Assault Regiment of th airborne ision, the th and th Air Assault Regiments of the th Guards Air Assault Division,  and  separate guard brigades of special purpose the rd special operational regiments of the Russian national guard, and the th separate guards brigade of marines of the Pacic Fleet.  So far no commanders have been named from these forces apart from Omurbekov. Russian sources have hit back claiming the Ukrainians were responsible for the atrocities in Bucha and other locations - and are the ones guilty of war crimes. Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said: “The Russian defence ministry has fully rejected these  accusations.” He said: ”I would like to point out that Russian troops left Bucha on March . “The Ukrainian authorities remained silent all these days, and now they have suddenly posted sensational footage in order to tarnish Russia’s image and make Russia defend itself.  I would like to emphasise with full responsibility that not a single civilian suffered from violence when the town was controlled by the Russian Armed Forces.ed Forces. On the contrary, our troops delivered  tonnes of humanitarian aid for civilians. Meanwhile, the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the town of Bucha right after Russian troops had left was deliberately ignored in the US. “This is what could have caused civilian casualties. That said, the Kiev regime is clearly trying to blame its atrocities on Russia.” Konstantin Kosachev, deputy speaker of the Russian upper house of parliament, said: “There are no doubts that it is a staging organised by Kyiv authorities. “And the fact that the West has picked it up and is hyping it makes it an accomplice of this cynical and immoral crime.”  Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed Kyiv colluded with the West in seeking to blame Russia. I think that the very fact that these statements were made minutes after these materials were released leaves no doubts as for who has contracted this story, she told state-run Rossiya- television channel. The West decided immediately Russia was to blame “based on the videos, seconds-long videos and several photos. “And they are ready to pour accusations. “No expert work done, no information from the other side throwing light on what is going on... She claimed the massacres were a provocation staged by the Ukrainian military and radical nationalists” to disrupt peace talks. Also today, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will hold talks with her Polish counterpart, Zbigniew Rau, during the second day of her visit to the capital, Warsaw. She has called for Russia to be hit with the maximum level of sanctions and for more weapons to be supplied to Mr Zelenskyaposs forces to help repel the Kremlinaposs troops. The idea that we should wait for something  bad to happen is just completely wrong, she said, applying pressure to allies. The reality is that money is still flowing from the West into Putinaposs war machine - and that has to stop. She pressed for a clear timetable to eliminate imports of Russian oil, gas and gold, and for a further crackdown on industries financing Moscowaposs invasion. Polandaposs prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for focusing on the voices of German businesses rather than the innocents slain in Ukraine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to urge Germany to set a date for phasing out Russian gas when he meets Mr Scholz in Downing Street on Friday.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

The children then sat down to an excellent tea and did ample justice to all the good things provided."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-reaching-core","story":"The results of a recent study on the effects of storytelling on children in hospital, published in the scientic journal PNAS , state: “We found that, compared with an active control condition, one storytelling session with hospitalised children leads to an increase in oxytocin, a reduction in cortisol and pain, and positive emotional shts.” It concluded that “these important clinical implications affirm storytelling as a low-cost and humanised intervention that can improve the wellbeing of hospitalised children”.Oxytocin is the feel-good emotion, often associated with childbirth, but which can play a role in reducing stress and anxiety for us all. It’s a hormone which helps build trust and attachment, as opposed to cortisol, which increases stress levels.We do sometimes need cortisol when faced with a challenge or fearful situation, so it does have its . It’s part of our fight and flight response. But the problem arises when levels remain too high for an extended period of time, as this keeps our bodies under a constant state of stress.When this happens, it can cause anxiety and depression, but also lots of physical issues such as headaches and tummy pain. It’s very dficult to concentrate and remember things when we are in this state.The study showed that for children in hospital, a time full of stress and worry for many reasons, storytelling resulted in an increase in oxytocin levels and reduction of cortisol, and so made the children feel less anxious and stressed, and even helped ease their physical pain.While the context of this research was children in the very stressful situation of being in hospital, I think the results and conclusions are also relevant for children in other stressful settings, including at school and home. I’m not making a direct comparison, but we’ve not had ‘normal times’ recently, and even in usual times, high levels of stress can be a big issue for many. So levels of stress and anxiety are heightened, even beyond the ‘normal’ for many of us.Some of the language in the article is related to the science of the findings, but the conclusions and observations are things teachers, parents and storytellers of all kinds will recognise. It describes how children being told the story “are transported to another possible world during storytelling sessions” and can “elicit positive physiological and psychological changes”. In other words, it can have a positive effect on physical and mental health.This transportation to “another possible world” is what storytellers often refer to as the story trance. It’s when children are absorbed in a story, and taken by their imagination to the world the story creates. The report explains that this absorption stimulates ious parts of the brain and aids the listener’s development of empathy, as well as a better understanding of their own emotions.None of this is really surprising, of course. But it’s really useful to have this kind of scientic back-up. An important finding was that the stories told were ones widely available and not specically adapted for therapeutic use just the kind of tales you find in a book from the library.And while they used professional storytellers for the research, a key point was that everyone can have this impact, including parents and caregivers: “It is important to note that even though we have used experienced storytellers for our research purposes, we believe that parents should be encouraged to tell their children stories. As we have shown, it is not necessary to use special stories or books or even specic techniques to achieve a successful outcome. Storytelling can be an effective means of creating important emotional bonds.”As I have said, this study looked at the impact of storytelling for children in hospital, which can be a deeply distressing time for both child and parents.Reading the report made me remember the time I was seven years old in the Western General Hospital, in an isolation ward by myself, very ill. I was told a story about a dragon who lived in a castle, and was given a model castle, made from used toilet rolls, and painted silver. I’d look at it when I was alone, which I always was except for visits. It was a stage for my imagination. I’d speak to the dragon and imagine the adventures I’d have with him when I finally got out of hospital. These stories were always my secret, but they helped me get out of hospital and have fun, when in the real world I could do neither.The thing is, our kids, as well ourselves, need this. The story is part of it, the characters, the challenges, the suspense, the connection to the emotions in the tale. It all works on our brain and our being.

Overdrafts are rising at an alarming rate and several Scottish farmers have already sold off sows to cut losses.The pig sector encountered signicant disruption during the Covid- pandemic which affected processing capacity and saw the partial closure of Scotland’s largest pig abattoir facility at Brechin.Much to the disappointment of NFU Scotland, several major retailers have continued to stock signicant volumes of imported pork, undermining, the union says, home production.And the dramatic spike in animal feed prices in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has also signicantly increased the scale of current losses on pig farms.It is in the interests of Scottish consumers, processors, and retailers, adds the union, that farmgate prices for pigs rise immediately to stave off a rapid rate of herd liquidations.Speaking on behalf of NFU Scotland, Mr Wyllie thanked the Cabinet Secretary for the pig hardship scheme in Scotland, established following the Covid-driven closure of the Brechin abattoir, but called on her to consider further immediate, direct support for the sector to ensure a critical mass of production was preserved.He also asked for the Scottish Government to consider an ‘Ongoers’ loan scheme to help financially support those who saw their future in the industry.NFU Scotland called on the Scottish Government to seek greater retailer support for Scottish pork, highlighting that a small percentage increase in the volume of home-produced pork on supermarket shelves would make a considerable dference.Help in re-establishing the Chinese export licence at Brechin, lost because of the Covid outbreak at the plant, would also expand the market opportunities for Scottish pig producers.At a UK level, NFU Scotland called for the Scottish Government to push Westminster on the need for “proper border controls” to monitor pork imports and for the English language requirements for overseas butchers looking to come to the UK to work in the staff-strapped processing sector to be relaxed."},{"url":null,"title":"six-county-schools-come-together-climate-change-event","story":"Teams of  pupils had to produce a plan for a product or initiative and an accompanying poster and presentation, which was made to a judging .Belhaven Hill School hosted the event, which was attended by pupils from Gordonstoun Junior School, Strathallan Prep School, Ardvreck, Fettes Prep and Cargilfield, earlier this month.The categories for the climate change event were defined by the annual Earthshot Prize, with each team choosing from: the restoration and protection of nature air cleanliness ocean revival waste-free living and climate action.Olly Langton, Belhaven Hill headmaster, said: “We want to ensure our pupils know that they can have a signicant impact on their environment now and in the future.“So my we Rosie and I came up with the idea of developing a Community of Prep and Primary Schoolsin Scotland to energise the children and bring them together to form an alliance to protect the things they love.“We were also keen to involve members of the local Dunbar community, where there is a strong environmental ethos which encourages collaboration.”The teams presented to a  of judges from the sustainability sector: Jonathan Hodges, senior innovation engineer at Wave Energy Scotland Duncan Lang, senior environment specialist at the Asian Development Bank and Izzy Heard, technical officer for the Climate Disclosure Project.The lists introduced themselves before watching each -minute presentation and giving immediate feedback.The teams completed a number of environmentally themed talks and activities, while Surfers Against Sewage encouraged youngsters to ‘Think Global Act Local’.“It was a pleasure to hear the great ideas and passionate presentations from this next generation of climate-aware thinkers,” said Mr Hodges.“The projects started by these students have already created positive change in their schools and communities, and I have no doubt they will follow-up with more.”In the afternoon, pupils took part in the Scottish Prep Schools Debating Championship – the motion challenged the children to consider whether short-haul flights should be banned.Edinburgh’s Cargilfield triumphed in both competitive elements of the day.The prize for outstanding inidual award on the day went to a pupil from Ardvreck, who went away with a voucher for a surfing lesson at Belhaven Bay, thanks to the generosity of CoastCoast.The next day, the bay was also the location for the first ForthSHORE beach clean by pupils from Belhaven with GreenTweed Eco.All the children took away a bird box, thanks to the East Lothian Primary Schools Bird Box Project, sponsored by ArdMoor, and a certicate.The next stage of the venture is for all of the schools to take part in a joint fundraising venture in the summer term.

Poverty is very much still with us, even within our most well-off communities. East Lothian Council has an updated poverty strategy and the local area partnerships have had specic funding to tackle poverty and inequalities.The pandemic, Brexit and the war in Ukrainehave all added to the pressures on prices of le’s basics, from food to transport and utilities. A rural area like ours has many who rely on heating oil, which is now about £ a litre. Many in the villages have no public transport and need to run a car.I attend the East Lothian Friendly Food Network – a council-supported network of those involved in food from across the county. Many of those who attend are from the county’s foodbanks and community pantries.The Scottish Government recently ran a consultation on how the need for foodbanks may be ended. However, all facilities in East Lothian report growing calls for support.Those needing help include, as well as those on benefits, increasing numbers of those on low pay who find that the cost of basics is a growing proportion of their weekly income.There have been mounting calls for food that does not need cooking. There are increasing requests for help to pay for gas and electricity. The charges to those on prepaid meters are higher and the top-ups on a card last for much less time than before.One organisation has been giving hot water bottles as it’s cheaper to boil a kettle to fill a bottle than turn the heating on. Organisations across the county are arranging free community meals. Breakfast club provision for children is expanding to ensure children do not go to school hungry.I recently attended a national conference where the cost of living crisis was debated. The experience identied in East Lothian is replicated across the UK.The Chancellor’s Spring Statement could have given much more help than it did. Benefits and state pension remain lagging behind the rate of inflation and could have been increased VAT could have been reduced on fuel for heating, lighting and cooking the uplt in Universal Credit could have been restored the increase in National Insurance waived. Sadly, those with the least income are those who lost out and will continue to see the cost of living eating into their weekly money pot.In the meantime, residents can continue to support the many excellent local organisations offering support, whether as donations of food, money or volunteering time. They remain a vital leline for some of the most vulnerable in all our communities.Jacquie Bell Belhaven"},{"url":null,"title":"reveals-north-berwick-one-uks-best-seaside-towns","story":"The town received an overall rating of %.The list was compiled by reviews from more than , visitors who gave feedback on their recent trips to seaside towns, villages and resorts.Destinations were rated on their beaches, attractions, value for money, peace and quiet, and scenery.North Berwick scored the following for these categories:Beach:  Attractions:  Value for money:  Peace and quiet:  Scenery:  On Tripadvisor, visitors to North Berwick praise the town for its day trips, excursions and sights to see.

There is something about this trio that makes you feel they should be driving a camper van and have a dog called Scooby Doo. Whatever: after years of slight awkwardness they have gelled nicely.The first of nine regional visits was to the Highlands. The one-bedroom Lorne Cottage in Fort William is possibly the smallest home there has been in the competition. Homeowners Ciara and Arran were fans of the show and had plans to enter one day when they had their “big house”. Opportunity had knocked now, however, much to their delight.: A sneak peek inside cutest propertyThere had already been one casualty in their battle to have a magazine standard home complete with mustard-coloured velour sofa. “We no longer let our wee dog Ghost on the bed or couch since moving here,” confessed Ciara. Across Scotland, smirking dog lovers placed bets on how long that would last.With Lorne Cottage cheered to the rafters for its “cute as a button” look it was on to The Tower, a church conversion in the Black Isle dating from the s and modernised in the s. This was home to Rachel, Rob and dog Tia, who was allowed on the couch.Rachel had wanted to downsize to a small fishing village, but ended up with a gaff that could host a medium-sized royal wedding. Stunning, but you had to wonder, with a shiver, what it cost to heat.It was the perfect location for Anna to start throwing round terms such as mis en place and Escher-like staircase . You don’t get many of those on Changing Rooms.The final stop was Loch Lann House, an th century dovecote folly in Culloden that had Michael reminiscing about the good old days when you could buy a piece of land and build what you wanted on it.Fortunately, this was a charming pile, hoaching with character as we say in the west. Home to Rory, Eilidh and the youngest of their six children, Loch Lann had Anna’s favourite thing, a hanging chair, which she rushed to try. Then again, the house had pretty much everything crammed into it, including a golden bath from Paris, so the chances of a hanging chair were good.Michael said the place called to mind a George Bernard Show quote: “Some people see the world and ask why, and there are others that dream of things that never were and say why not ” Personally, I was thinking “nightmare to clean” but each to their own.: SHOTY judge on Skyes charmsThe winner, Lorne Cottage, should answer some of the criticism levelled at previous series: that SHOTY is all about fancy homes and expensive, designer-led style, what you might call a faux fur throw and nae knickers approach to home decoration. But Lorne Cottage won largely because the judges took to its vibe straight away. Who hasn’t done that when falling for a home On to the final, then, for Ciara, Arran, and Ghost.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD.

Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1649069162491.jpg--housing_provider_choice_and_trussell_trust_support_ni_families_in_need.jpg?1649069171000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220404newshousing provider choice and trussell trust support ni families in need","story":"Local housing association, Choice Housing has partnered with the Trussell Trust to provide food parcels to families in need across Northern Ireland. With the signicant rise in the cost of living, particularly the continued increase in gas and electricity prices, many are struggling to provide the basics of food and heat. Recent research indicated that one in every four children in Northern Ireland are living in a family which is struggling to provide basic requirements of heat, food, clothing, and childcare. Under these pressures many families are at risk of getting into further debt and are heavily reliant on food banks to supplement their financial situation. Carol Ervine, Choice Group Director of Tenant and Client Services said,“As an organisation we are committed to providing more than bricks and mortar and realise that whilst having a home is a human right, there are many who are living with the real threat of poverty and financial instability. With the cost of living continuing to rise, the cost of the weekly shop has become signicantly higher, and many families are making the decision between heating or eating. Working with the Trussell Trust, we are able to provide much needed food parcels to families in need, with the knowledge that this will ease at least part of the burden. The Trussell Trust support a UK network of food banks providing emergency food and support to people in poverty whilst campaigning for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. The Trust recently outlined that in the year  , .m food bank parcels were given to people in crisis in the past year across the UK with close to , emergency food parcels distributed across Northern Ireland in the same period. Jonny Currie, Northern Ireland Network Lead from the Trussell Trust said,“We welcome this partnership with Choice Housing providing vital support to our network of food banks in Northern Ireland. Food banks and their volunteers are extraordinary, and their response to need in their communities is inspiring. But that kind of response shouldn’t be needed. In the last year in Northern Ireland almost , emergency food parcels were provided by food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network – and more than , of these were for children. It’s not right that some of us cannot afford our own food.That’s why we are working towards a just, compassionate future, where no one should have to use a food bank to get by.

The message came at an event hosted by Ulster Bank ahead of its sponsorship of this year’s Balmoral Show where senior figures from within the bank outlined a number of key issues facing the local agri-food sector and reaffirmed Ulster Bank’s commitment to supporting the industry. Ulster Bank Senior Agriculture Manager, Cormac McKervey, and the bank’s Chief Economist, Northern Ireland, Richard Ramsey, updated media, including members of the Guild of Agricultural Journalists, as well as other stakeholders, on the overall health of the local farming and food sectors and related economic issues. They were joined by Ulster Bank Head of Northern Ireland, Mark Crimmins, who encouraged those in the audience to grasp the opportunities presented by a new, greener economy. Speaking at the bank’s annual briefing held in Stock Kitchen, above St. George’s Market, Mr Crimmins said: “The agri-food sector is a key pillar of the Northern Ireland economy, and we remain strongly committed to supporting it through the many challenges it currently faces. In particular, we want to work in partnership with the sector to tackle climate change and provide the tools and expertise agri-businesses need to fulfil their green ambitions. “As a leading financier of renewable energy projects, we have recently launched two new green propositions including green loans and green asset finance options for qualying SMEs. All of our business managers now undergo specialist climate training and are now fully equipped to assist customers, including those in the agri-sector, on their sustainability journey.” Cormac McKervey, Senior Agriculture Manager, Ulster Bank, said: “Undoubtedly, farmers in Northern Ireland are operating through very challenging times and the pace and scale at which input costs continue to rise is alarming. Farm gate prices for beef, lamb, grain, and milk are at an all-time high but margins remain static and, in some cases, are actually lower than this time last year. “Many farmers are having to manage their cash flow extremely carefully, and while profitability has yet to dip, certain sub-sectors of the industry are being exposed to greater risks. Pig farmers are facing the most signicant impact with input costs rocketing and the price for pork falling throughout the year. “Land prices remain strong, and the demand is still high, yet we expect the majority of farmers to adopt a holding position rather than look to expand, given the other budgetary pressures currently facing the sector. Perhaps when Tier  approvals are received, then we will see an increase in overall capital investment.” At the event, Richard Ramsey presented his annual Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index, which shows that the price of all items making up the cooked breakfast gauge rose in the year to the end of February, using the UK Retail Price Index . Milk saw the biggest price increase in the index with a rise of .% in the -months. There were also strong rises in the prices of a range of other items including eggs , butter , mushrooms , breadand sausages . Overall, the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index – the average inflation rate of the items included - rose by a robust .% in the past year, meaning that the index is at its highest level since March . This was the peak of the Ulster Fry Index and coincided with another cost-of-living crisis. Looking back even further - since the last recession , the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index has risen a whopping %. Richard Ramsey says that the Ulster Fry Index contains a more important message this year than ever. “Food makes up a signicant proportion of household spending. ‘Food and drink’ is also a key sector of the Northern Ireland economy. So, understanding how the price of food items is changing gives us some insight into both the current state of consumer finances, and also some of the challenges facing the agri-food industry,” Mr. Ramsey says. “The fact that we are now in a new cost of living crisis means that creating understanding of price rises and cost pressures and where they are coming from is essential. What the Ulster Fry Index is telling us is that the prices of everyday items like milk and bread are rising really strongly at a time whenever households are also having to contend with big rises in their household energy bills. “The reality though is that the Ulster Fry Index is only going to go one way in the foreseeable future, and that is up. Given the surge in energy prices already, alongside the disruption to the global food supply-chain stemming from the war between Russia and Ukraine, the Ulster Fry Index is expected to experience double-digit inflation over the next  months. This would see the Ulster Fry Index hit a new record high,” he continues. He adds: “Exactly this time two years ago, we thought we were entering a food crisis. People were stockpiling food items in the expectation of supply shortages and empty shelves, despite repeated reassurances from the industry and politicians. The reality was that the food and retail sectors pulled out all the stops to keep the supply lines open and to keep us fed. Today, two years on, though, a new and worrying food crisis is on the cards for dferent reasons. Russia and Ukraine are two of the most important producers and exporters of agricultural commodities in the world. Overall, the two countries export one in eight of all calories traded worldwide. What Saudi Arabia is to oil, Ukraine and Russia are to cereal crops. And don’t forget that cereal crops aren’t just a direct source of food, they are also a major indirect source of food in that they are fed to the livestock that we then consume. Food supply problems will further fuel economic nationalism due to the scramble for food security, meaning the further unwinding of globalisation, or de-globalisation. Indeed, such is the concern about the supply of food that countries are now hoarding and stockpiling by banning exports.

It is also worth checkingyou are on the cheapest electricity tarf.”“We encourage anyone who is struggling to pay their energy bills or top-up their meters to contact their supplier directly for help and information. We also encourage consumers to think about ways they can reduce their energy costs via energy efficiency, switching energy supplier, or changing billing method.“We appeal to firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to continued financial support for a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year.For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, The Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.”Firmus Energy said customers seeking advice on their natural gas bills or direct debit payments should contact their Customer Services team on    or info@firmusenergy.They added that their telephone lines are open  hours a day,  days a week, with free and independent advice on how to save energy available at NI Energy Advice Line on   .Consumers can also get in touch with the Consumer Council for free independent advice by calling Freephone    or by emailing contact@consumercouncil.org.uk.Related topicsCost of LivingMore On Cost of LivingNorthern Ireland food prices: Cost of Ulster fry soars by .%Belfast City Council looking to establish Poverty Commission amid cost of living crisisSinn Fein focuses on cost of living crisis as it kicks off campaignTesco petrol station in Craigavon runs out of fuel smart ways to save or generate money amid the ongoing cost of living crisisMost ReadTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionMan hospitalised following ‘serious’ road collision in County DownJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesUVF demands UDA Rathcoole chief Gary Fisher punishes thug after home attack breached local peace pactStudent stands before court accused of three counts of rapeTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayComedian makes fun of Channel  privatisation news with Derry Girls and other sketchesPlayVideo: Police attend sudden death on M motorway outside LurganLatest Northern IrelandDerry Girls creator Lisa McGee criticises decision to privatise Channel Lisa SmythOpinionNHS continues to flounder without NI Executive despite Covid wave waningSinn Fein running away from public statements on border poll, Donaldson claimsWorking families being forced to choose between heating or eating – MallonMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageLatestDerry Girls creator Lisa McGee criticises decision to privatise Channel Lisa SmythOpinionNHS continues to flounder without NI Executive despite Covid wave waningUlster with near full deck to select from for Toulouse duel as Ethan McIlroy only doubt for French tripRussian troops no dferent from Islamic State terrorists, Zelensky tells UNSinn Fein running away from public statements on border poll, Donaldson claims,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Pic: Liam McBurney PA WireNiamh CampbellTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe DUP’s new party election broadcast has received a mixed reaction, with many on social media criticising Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s focus on Sinn Fein.The clip, which last for two minutes and  seconds, shows the DUP leader walking up a mountain outside the Mournes to watch the sunrise with some of his party colleagues, including East Belfast assembly candidate Joanne Bunting and Diane Forsythe, the mum-of-three who replaced veteran MLA Jim Wells as the South Down assembly candidate. Notably, one person who is not featured is Edwin Poots, who replaced Christopher Stalford as the party’s MLA in South Belfast following his sudden death. Mr Poots is now standing for the DUP in the constituency in the upcoming election.Diane Forsythe was selected over Mr Poots to be the party’s South Down nominee in what has been widely seen as a snub to the man who was, for a brief period, party leader.In the new broadcast, Mr Donaldson explains to the camera his five-point plan to “build a better future for Northern Ireland within the union”. His proposals include “fixing the NHS, helping working families, keeping our schools world-class, growing the economy, and removing the Northern Ireland Protocol”.  Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He goes on to explain some of the measures intended to do this, which involve “creating , new jobs to keep our young people at home” and providing “ hours’ free childcare each week for parents”.“The Protocol remains a threat to our place within the United Kingdom,” Mr Donaldson continues.Sinn Fein want to win this election so they can implement their plans for a border poll, which means Northern Ireland will face months and even years of arguing and fighting, rather than fixing our health service and focusing on rebuilding and growing our economy. Now is not the time for more ision and uncertainty. Read MoreJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesSam McBride:OpinionBeating Sinn Fein will be hard, but dealing with what comes next will be harder for the DUPThat is why this election is so important. Your vote will decide on whether Northern Ireland’s future is one focused on fixing our health service, tackling the cost of living crisis and replacing the Protocol, or focused on a isive border poll.The DUP is the only party that can stop Sinn Fein’s border poll plans. A first-preference vote for any party other than the DUP will ide and weaken the unionist cause and help Sinn Fein deliver their border poll plan.”The video was first shown at the DUP’s Assembly election campaign launch in a Dundonald cinema on Monday. It has since also been shared across the party’s social media accounts and has aired on Northern Ireland TV channels, such as BBC NI and UTV. One user responded to the clip on social media, writing: “You will be extremely lucky to even get remotely near achieving any of the points in your plan. You have been arrogant and ignored your faithful voters for years.”Another inidual said: “You would need to go back to Stormont to achieve this plan,” criticising former DUP First Minister Paul Givan’s resignation in February, which led to the collapse of the Executive. Multiple people accused the party broadcast of having a “keep them#uns out” mantra, with one Twitter user posting: “Just saw the DUP#s Party Election Broadcast. Gaslighting in action, with a heavy dose of keep them#uns out! They really have nothing to offer society in . Northern Ireland deserves better than reactionaries like the DUP.”Listened to their party election broadcast earlier, same old drivel SF SF SF SF and a wee bit of important stuff,” wrote another. However, some members of the public have been showing their support for the clip, with one commenting: “Will be voting DUP this election.” Great Britain first stronger with Ulster Northern Ireland... support DUP %,” said another.Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie has also since responded to Sir Jeffrey’s claims in the broadcast that only his party can win the forthcoming Assembly election and stop Sinn Fein calling for a chance to vote on a united Ireland.Mr Beattie said: “Given that Sinn Fein have been repeatedly calling for a border poll with no success - even going as far as predicting a United Ireland by  - I don’t buy the DUP’s analysis that a vote for them will stop Sinn Fein calling for what they have always been calling for.It’s what Sinn Fein does.

I hope all of my children will, in time, become young farmers, get their Green Certs and we’ll be able to pass them on a reasonable quantity of land, whether they want to farm it or not at that stage. It will be up to them.”Both his grandparents and parents farmed and some of his young family are showing an interest.As for inheriting the land, he says he’s a “firm believer in Warren Buffett’s maxim – you should leave your children enough so they can do anything, but not enough that they can do nothing”.“But we are determined that the kids are not going to inherit a bundle of money. But I would like them to think thatwe’re in the fortunate position that we would be able to pass them on a nice house and they could inherit a farm of land and then they can decide what they want to do with it or not.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up His eldest son is studying Ag Science at school, something O’Leary says he’s “extremely proud” of.As to whether or not he would encourage them to go into farming, he says he would like them all to go to college and get a third-level qualication.“And then I would like them to at least have the option of going into farmingthey want or follow [another] professional career. I wouldn’t want to prejudge what they do. But I would certainly like... when I die, they would all inherit or get  acres of land or  acres of land and then they can decide what to do with it. They can set it, they can sell it or they can work it themselves.”Mr O’Leary’s current contract with Ryanair will expire in , but the group CEOsays he has no plans to step down.“No, I’ve no intention of retiring. I’m sure I’ll be having a discussion with the board over whether they want me to continue on for another contract. And as long as we can agree on reasonable payment terms, I’d be very happy to work on here for another couple of years,” he says.Askedhe will ever retire, he replies: “I hope not. I wouldn’t want to retire.“I don’t fancy myself retiring. We’re building a new management team in Ryanair... so we have very good managers coming along underneath me. I will probably not work as hard in Ryanair in the next five or  years as I’ve done in the last  years, but it will hopefully need less of my time anyway.”Despite rising inflation, he says people can still afford to fly “with Ryanair, because we’ve got the lowest airfare”, but he acknowledges that airfares are set to rise.“What we’re seeing at the moment is prices are slightly lower than they were in , pre-Covid, through March, April and May. They’re somewhere between pc and pc higher at the moment through June, July, August and September. I think they’re going to be higher priced in peak summer months this year for a couple of reasons.“Asia is still essentially closed and the Asians are not travelling to Europe. So more and more people are going to be holidaying on the beaches of Spain and Portugal, Italy and Greece this summer. So there’s more demand and probably pc fewer seats and that’s going to result in forward bookings being stronger and fares being slightly higher.“I think fares will be up this year in the peak summer months by between pc and pc. They’re not going to go pc or pc. And partly, that’s because we’re adding another  aircraft this year.“So we’re adding another  million seats into the market. So partly, we’ll keep prices down by growing so strongly.”And while the era of cheap flights is not over, he warns there are threats ahead.“Our tourism industry is also heavily dependent upon having low-cost air access in from Europe, so we can bring the Germans and the Italians and the French and the Spanish here.“Our Government needs to fight against environmental taxes because environmental taxes will be very damaging for peripheral countries.”Most ReadTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionMan hospitalised following ‘serious’ road collision in County DownJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesUVF demands UDA Rathcoole chief Gary Fisher punishes thug after home attack breached local peace pactStudent stands before court accused of three counts of rapeTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayComedian makes fun of Channel  privatisation news with Derry Girls and other sketchesPlayVideo: Police attend sudden death on M motorway outside LurganLatest Republic of Ireland, artists to receive  euro every week in pilot schemeIrish premier backs EU ban on coal and oil imports from RussiaRise in inflation will impact Ireland for years to come, Tanaiste saysData retention used in Graham Dwyer murder case breached EU law, court rules, sign letter calling for Irish language legislationLatestLisa SmythOpinionNHS continues to flounder without NI Executive despite Covid wave waningUlster with near full deck to select from for Toulouse duel as Ethan McIlroy only doubt for French tripYorkshire’s bid to draw line under racism claims continues with aptly-named dealCrest and Taylor Wimpey reveal hefty bills for cladding works after new pledgeSunak and we donate more than £, to Winchester College,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Or you have to say that I didn’t believe in these targets in the first place.”. @AdairTurnerUK, Chair of @INETeconomics: “We know the technologies which will enable us to build that massively bigger and green electricity system. They are primarily renewables, they should involve extending the existing le of nuclear as long as possible.” #energy inquiry pic VcDSah— Lords Economic Affairs CommitteeApril , Lord Turner, who is now chair of energy and transitions commission, Institute for New Economic Thinking, said that the UK faced a major challenge to heat its homes in a green way.Speaking on the Lords Economic Affairs Committee, he said that private businesses were likely to fund the transition of the electricity system. But on heating, around  million households would need to spend money to ensure that their houses were heated in an environmentally green way.This would mean adding insulation – the UK has the worst-insulated homes in Europe – and switching from gas boilers to heat pumps and similar technologies.He called for direct Government help for the bottom % of households and to use mortgages and cheap loans to help out middle earners.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may, however, be an unsightly visual impact created by the large tunnel entrances needed in Strangford and Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A new school is to be constructed on the site of the existing St

the town.ldquoAn investment appraisal has recently been carried out by the Department of Education to consider how best to meet the long-term needs of the pupils at St Malachyrsquos and this has come out in favour of a new school on the existing site, he added.Mr McGrady said this week: ldquoI welcome this development as I have been making on-going representations on the matter to Lord Belstead

ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who has compiled a report on underway drinking which is to be presented to Down Council.KILLYLEAGH ndash The town of Killyleagh is set for a financial boost to help revive its economic, commercial and environmental appearance, it has been revealed.A preliminary application has been made to the International Fund for a core project to help trigger a revival in the townrsquos fortunes.And by the end of the year, plans to designate the town as a conservation area will be completed.The investment in Killyleaghrsquos future was revealed when the chairman of Down District Council, Mr Sean Quinn, officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, told the launch gathering that he has been delighted to assist the committee towards its goals of reviving the town.Mr McGrady said Killyleagh had recognised that it was very much an era of self-help.He looked forward to the day when Killyleagh is selected as the site for the Strangford Lough Liaison Office and is designated as the Gateway to Strangford Lough, fulfilling its tourist potential.LEITRIM ndash An  month battle to have a Leitrim footpath declared a right of way has found its way to Westminster.The Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints has been asked to investigate Banbridge Councilrsquos handling of the matter after more than  people signed a petition asking for the adoption of the footpath as a right-of-way.The footpath, which is marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August  when the petition was formally presented, and shortly afterwards the council voted overwhelmingly to adopt the pathway, subject to legal opinions.However, for the next  months no progress was made on the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

Also that no Bill of Rights specic to NI is introduced here. Separate bases for rights legislation on either side of the Irish Sea would be yet another step towards all island policy making. ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

game changer and praised those behind the ambitious prospectus.Derry’s  All Ireland GAA winner and dual star, Colm McGurk, is the architect drawing up the development of the site that will also incorporate a museum dedicated to cross-community education and remembrance.The timetable for completion would factor in a -month construction once the first sod is turned following an earlier procurement stage.The advisory board which has steered the development has been lauded for its cross-community membership with a unionist, a former UK Cabinet minister, academia and the GAA.Board member, Fergal McCormack, who is managing director of PKF-FPM accountants, has leaned on the need to expedite the plans with interest from all over Ireland, London and Australia.“This project has huge potential,” said Mr McCormack.The Warrenpoint man also suggested that the former Irish president, Mary McAleese could be recognised at the facility as a highly regarded Co Down woman who reached highest office in the land.GAABritish Army  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to

Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.“To the teams of vaccinators, administrative staff and volunteers who have worked tirelessly over the past  months – thank you. Your commitment and dedication has been truly remarkable. This was a team effort and it has been a huge honour to be involved.“From the outset we have known that every jab counts and it is thanks to you that there have been many lives saved, and far, far fewer people seriously ill in hospital due to covid. You should be very proud of the role you have played.”Speaking to the public, Ms Donnelly said: “Thank you for rolling up your sleeves and helping to protect yourselves and those around you from this terrible disease. However we’re not at the finish line just yet. I’ve made plenty of appeals to the public in the past  months but I’m sure I’ll be forgiven for one more - please come forward for your jabs.“It’s vital that everyone in the  plus age group and those who have severely weakened immune systems come forward for their spring booster. I would again encourage everyone who is eligible for their booster to get it without delay. Vaccination clinics are still running across Northern Ireland and people are still coming forward for boosters as well as first and second doses. It’s not too late to get protected.”Patricia was a clinical psychologist by profession and held a number of key positions at Trust level before retiring. Her contribution to the health service will continue by chairing the HSC Clinical Ethics Forum and the NI Bereavement Network.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe owner of Coaltown Coffee was still just a teenager when he started up his business – then called Roasted Joe’s – in  after leaving secondary school with no qualications.Nearly a decade after dad Gordon helped him build his first roaster, Coaltown’s products are being savoured around the world and the company is continuing to go from strength to strength.With the support of Gordon and mum Jennine, Scott has made a big mark on his hometown of Ammanford, with their Foundry Road roastery popular among locals and those from further afield.Given that his parents used to run their own café and older generations of the family were grocers and restaurateurs, it is perhaps no surprise that the coffee industry has been Scott’s calling.Great-grandfather Ben, a miner in the former coal town, inspired the rebranding of the company, and Scott hasn’t looked back since ditching the Roasted Joe’s name.“The mining industry was a big part of everyday le in this area and that’s gone, it’s been completely wiped out,” he told the Welsh Business Heroes webinar.“It was really impactful, and the idea of that industry that’s no longer here was very much the inspiration behind what we wanted to do with the brand, which is where the name came from.“We were doing some research into the mining industry and one of the terms for what they called coal was ‘black gold’.“Coal gave a massive amount of employment and industry to the area, and, when you look at coffee, black gold is the same term used for coffee growing regions.“They are two very dferent worlds but are tied together through black gold.”In , Coaltown became one of the first coffee companies in the UK to be B Corp certied, meaning they are committed to prioritising the environment and society in how they do business..removeAnd that ethical approach to doing things has, according to Scott, always been at the forefront of his mind as an entrepreneur.“We went on a trip to New York to see my favourite roasteries,” he said.“I can’t stress enough how massively influential that trip was. You really do need to go somewhere and soak it all in because it just inspires you and makes you have a completely dferent approach to what you do.“That’s where I first encountered Square as a brand before they opened in the UK, and it was also where I first encountered B Corp.“It’s a universally adopted accreditation which allows you to implement a lot of sustainability ethics into one brand.“B Corp is a really good thing for giving you a general overview of everything you do as a business.“What B Corp means is that you are putting your planet before profit and your business as a force for good and change before anything .“I don’t think any business opening as a fresh start-up today can open without that in mind. It’s not a tradable landscape for you to be able to grow within.“You have to have that ethical approach to everything you do.“B Corp, as a brand, really summed up everything we were as a business “We were awarded that in December  and announced it in late January , and we were the first specialty roastery in UK to get it so we were very proud of that.“It was a big feat because we were up against some really big players in the UK.“We all have the ambition to be ethical and do the best we can, but to get that certication first was a really big thing for us.“It’s looking at how you run your business from the ground up.“As a brand, we’ve been purpose driven, so it’s about how we can bring a new industry to our hometown, and now post-industrial towns across the UK.“It has always been our intention to have an ethical brand.“Essentially, the coal industry is the opposite of what we are, we’re trying to be the opposite of what the coal industry was with fossil fuels and bad carbon.”Watch the Welsh Business Heroes episode featuring Scott James of Coaltown Coffee in its entirety here - www.youtube watch vKZFsjhVei article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThere has been a moratorium on shale gas extraction since November , on the basis of evidence that it was not possible to accurately predict tremors associated with fracking.But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has written to the British Geological Survey asking for a report on the latest science around fracking including new techniques, improvements in geological modelling or areas outside of Lancashire – where fracking has taken place – less at risk of tremors. vw,vw,px, px\"Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said the Government will be guided by science He said the Government was and would be guided by the science on shale gas but in the light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine it was “absolutely right that we explore all possible domestic energy sources”.It comes as the fossil fuel industry and some MPs have urged a restart to fracking or more extraction from North Sea oil and gas to secure energy supplies and ease prices.But there have also been widespread calls for insulating homes, more renewables and weaning the country off gas in response to the crisis, and warnings further domestic fossil fuel exploration will do nothing to lower prices pegged to international markets.Mr Kwarteng said: “It remains the case that fracking in England would take years of exploration and development before commercial quantities of gas could be produced for the market, and would certainly have no effect on prices in the near term.“However, there will continue to be an ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming decades as we transition to cheap renewable energy and new nuclear power.“In light of Putin’s criminal invasion of Ukraine, it is absolutely right that we explore all possible domestic energy sources.“However, unless the latest scientic evidence demonstrates that shale gas extraction is safe, sustainable and of minimal disturbance to those living and working nearby, the pause in England will remain in place,” he said..removeFracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a process in which liquid is pumped deep underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil trapped within it.The process has been mired in controversy since it hit the headlines in  for causing two minor earthquakes in Lancashire, prompting a temporary ban on fracking in the UKThat was later lted, with controls put in place to prevent tremors, but fracking continued to draw opponents who fear it can also cause water contamination, noise and traffic pollution.Environmentalists also warn that pursuing new sources of gas – a fossil fuel – is not compatible with efforts to tackle climate change, and the focus should be on developing cleaner sources of energy such as renewables. vw,vw,px, px\"Fracking at Preston New Road was suspended indefinitely after a record-breaking tremor measuring . on the Richter scale in August , with the moratorium or “pause” coming in a few months later.Earlier this year, Cuadrilla, who operated the site was ordered to permanently cap and abandon the only two horizontal shale wells that have been drilled in the UK.That demand was suspended as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine intensied already soaring gas prices, which have hit households with a more than % increase in energy bills.The move comes as the Government prepares to unveil its new energy security strategy this week, in which it is expected to set out plans to boost new nuclear power capacity, solar and offshore wind, but not cheap onshore wind, which is popular with the public but opposed by some Tory politicians.Ahead of the strategy’s launch, minister Jacob Rees-Mogg downplayed the earthquake risks from fracking and suggested “every last drop” of oil should be extracted from the North Sea.But UN science body the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeissued a report on Monday warning of the need for immediate and rapid emissions cuts, with substantial reductions in fossil fuel use, to avert catastrophic climate change.As the report was launched, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure was “moral and economic madness”.Shadow climate change and net zero secretary Ed Miliband said: “Rather than bowing to their own backbenchers, the Government should be coming forward with real action to ensure energy security and tackle the cost-of-living crisis.“The Government itself concluded that fracking is unsafe, and will not help our energy security or cut bills. And fracking is strongly opposed by local communities.“Labour would turbocharge the drive to clean, home-grown renewable and nuclear power to provide energy security, cut bills and tackle the climate crisis.”Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: “The Government clearly recognises the huge potential that shale gas offers this country, and this review may be a tentative first step towards overturning the moratorium and exploiting that potential.”He said the Oil and Gas Authority had released a report in  which found seismicity was “imperceptible” at the first of Cuadrilla’s two Preston New Road shale wells, and the Royal Society had said seismic risks of fracking were low.“We trust that this review will allow Britain’s huge shale gas resources to be exploited,” he said, claiming it would create tens of thousands of jobs, bolster energy security, provide cheaper gas for local communities and millions of pounds in tax revenues for northern councils.But Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Danny Gross said: “The idea that shale gas extraction will signicantly lower energy bills or improve energy security is pure fantasy.“Fracking has been deeply unpopular with communities that have faced the prospect of shale gas extraction.“Energy efficiency and developing the UK’s vast renewable power potential are the best ways to deal with the energy crisis and bring down soaring fuel bills – and this must be the focus of the Government’s upcoming energy review.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Review commissioned into latest science on fracking as energy debate intensies article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Her hand-painted ‘Welcome to Banbridge’ mural in Newry Street celebrates the Brontë link to the area using typography inspired by the world’s most famous literary family.Artist Friz pays homage to the town’s most famous landmark and Europe’s first ever flyover, Downshire Bridge. The mural of Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton at Bridge Street.

Inspired by the area’s linen history, Rob Hilken’s mural at Linenhall Street depicts damask linen with a Jacquard weaving pattern that was created by local linen mills. The chrysanthemum damask design used was created by William Liddell and incorporates the distinctive pattern found on Jacquard loom punch cards, which were used to create the complex damask designs that made the Banbridge area world-famous for its linen.Belfast-based artist and illustrator FGB’smural at Bridge Street celebrates the town’s association to Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton who was educated at Banbridge Academy Preparatory School.

Dublin-based Decoy’s mural at Scarva Street celebrates Banbridge as a strategic river crossing point, a communication route between Belfast and Dublin and a focus for agricultural industry, trade and commerce. An ancient king’s road connecting Ulster to the rest of the island once crossed the Bann at a forging place a short distance downstream at Ballykeel.In addition to the new street art, one of Banbridge’s most iconic landmarks - a B-listed monument dedicated to Captain Crozier which memorialises his contribution to polar exploration - has undergone signicant restoration work.Holly Pereira on Newry Street.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"late s and early s ballyclare may fair era captured in rhymes and ructions ","story":"Entertainer William Caulfield banned for driving up to an estimated ‘mph’   Young teenager dies in M motorway crash between Lurgan and MoiraNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPeopleLate s and early s Ballyclare May Fair era captured in ‘Rhymes and Ructions’The halcyon days of music and merriment in Ballyclare in the run up to the annual May Fair are revisited in a new publication by author and local historian Jack McKinney.By The NewsroomFriday, st April , : pm  \"       \"  ‘Rhymes and Ructions’ - with its eye-catching and locally-linked front and back covers - refers to the title of a series of concerts organised by the Ballyclare and District Historical Society in the town in the late s and early s.

They gradually gained popularity with the audience and, being held on the Monday night before the annual May Fair Day, reflected the atmosphere of jollication that pervaded the town at this special time of year.An eye-catching image from Ballyclare.“The music was provided by ious groups of instrumentalists – fiddlers, accordionists, tin whistle players – and their sessions were interspersed with songs, recitations and stories by local inidual entertainers drawn from the lore and culture of the Six Mile Water region. Many of these songs and much of the material came from an oral tradition and few were available in written form.”Verses of material from local ‘balladeers’ Ernie Scott, Sandy Robinson, Jock Gilmour and Matt Meharg together with short biographical details of these and many others feature in the pages of the book.Jack continued: “Sadly the concerts came to an end when the security situation dictated that crowds gathering in halls became impossible. The Historical Society planned to celebrate the th anniversary of the founding of the society in  by reviving the Rhymes and Ructions concert in  but the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic put paid to their plans.”In his introduction to Rhyme and Ructions Jack, who is the author of a number of local history studies including ‘Stories of a Letime’, also reveals what inspired this latest publication.Author Jack McKinney with his latest publication.“What I am endeavouring to do here is to compile a collection of the ballads and anecdotes that proved so popular at the concerts. The tone and subjects of the ballads y considerably from the amusing to those of a more contemplative nature. As for their credibility I leave the readers to assess this for themselves.”Jack has pursued his interest in local history and its characters with zeal since retiring in  after a four-decade career as an assistant and principal teacher in east Antrim primary schools. The former Mossley Primary School pupil, taught at Abbots Cross, Ballyclare and Whitehead Primary Schools. And in the manner in which he inspired many pupils, Jack is keen to share his enthusiasm for knowledge with a whole new generation of readers.A founder member of the Ulster-Scots Language Society, Jack added: “The ballads are recorded in the style of language used in the originals – standard English or Ulster- Scots. The stories and other text may contain either or both. I have often followed the style of a mixture of Ulster -Scots and English as in the Scottish ‘Kaleyard’ novels, familiar to readers of Archibald McIlroy’s books, where the conversational dialogue of characters is in Ulster-Scots with the rest of the narrative in standard English.”The ‘Wreck of the Never Budge’, ‘Courting and Possible Consequences’ or ‘The May Fair and lots of Houzeldoo’ provide a hint of Ballyclare May Fairs past and possible inspiration for future balladeers and storytellers.

With the signicant rise in the cost of living, particularly the continued increase in gas and electricity prices, many are struggling to provide the basics of food and heat. Recent research indicated that one in every four children in Northern Ireland are living in a family which is struggling to provide basic requirements of heat, food, clothing, and childcare. Under these pressures many families are at risk of getting into further debt and are heavily reliant on food banks to supplement their financial situation. Carol Ervine, Choice Group Director of Tenant and Client Services said,“As an organisation we are committed to providing more than bricks and mortar and realise that whilst having a home is a human right, there are many who are living with the real threat of poverty and financial instability. With the cost of living continuing to rise, the cost of the weekly shop has become signicantly higher, and many families are making the decision between heating or eating. Working with the Trussell Trust, we are able to provide much needed food parcels to families in need, with the knowledge that this will ease at least part of the burden. The Trussell Trust support a UK network of food banks providing emergency food and support to people in poverty whilst campaigning for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. The Trust recently outlined that in the year  , .m food bank parcels were given to people in crisis in the past year across the UK with close to , emergency food parcels distributed across Northern Ireland in the same period. Jonny Currie, Northern Ireland Network Lead from the Trussell Trust said,“We welcome this partnership with Choice Housing providing vital support to our network of food banks in Northern Ireland. Food banks and their volunteers are extraordinary, and their response to need in their communities is inspiring. But that kind of response shouldn’t be needed. In the last year in Northern Ireland almost , emergency food parcels were provided by food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network – and more than , of these were for children. It’s not right that some of us cannot afford our own food.That’s why we are working towards a just, compassionate future, where no one should have to use a food bank to get by. Choice also manage a Financial Inclusion programme, through which they are supporting tenants to improve their money management, ensuring they can maximise their income. In the last year this programme helped tenants access pound. million in financial gains, and specialised staff at Choice are continuing to help tenants with benefits, debt, and budgeting advice.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbbbaaabab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fffbaafebbdab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1649166321462.jpg--ulster_fry_index_at_its_highest_since_2014.jpg?164916632200","title":"ulster fry index at its highest since  ","story":"Farmers and consumers alike can expect food, fuel, and energy prices to increase as a new cost of living crisis continues to put pressure on Northern Ireland households. The message came at an event hosted by Ulster Bank ahead of its sponsorship of this year’s Balmoral Show where senior figures from within the bank outlined a number of key issues facing the local agri-food sector and reaffirmed Ulster Bank’s commitment to supporting the industry. Ulster Bank Senior Agriculture Manager, Cormac McKervey, and the bank’s Chief Economist, Northern Ireland, Richard Ramsey, updated media, including members of the Guild of Agricultural Journalists, as well as other stakeholders, on the overall health of the local farming and food sectors and related economic issues. They were joined by Ulster Bank Head of Northern Ireland, Mark Crimmins, who encouraged those in the audience to grasp the opportunities presented by a new, greener economy. Speaking at the bank’s annual briefing held in Stock Kitchen, above St. George’s Market, Mr Crimmins said: “The agri-food sector is a key pillar of the Northern Ireland economy, and we remain strongly committed to supporting it through the many challenges it currently faces. In particular, we want to work in partnership with the sector to tackle climate change and provide the tools and expertise agri-businesses need to fulfil their green ambitions. “As a leading financier of renewable energy projects, we have recently launched two new green propositions including green loans and green asset finance options for qualying SMEs. All of our business managers now undergo specialist climate training and are now fully equipped to assist customers, including those in the agri-sector, on their sustainability journey.” Cormac McKervey, Senior Agriculture Manager, Ulster Bank, said: “Undoubtedly, farmers in Northern Ireland are operating through very challenging times and the pace and scale at which input costs continue to rise is alarming. Farm gate prices for beef, lamb, grain, and milk are at an all-time high but margins remain static and, in some cases, are actually lower than this time last year. “Many farmers are having to manage their cash flow extremely carefully, and while profitability has yet to dip, certain sub-sectors of the industry are being exposed to greater risks. Pig farmers are facing the most signicant impact with input costs rocketing and the price for pork falling throughout the year. “Land prices remain strong, and the demand is still high, yet we expect the majority of farmers to adopt a holding position rather than look to expand, given the other budgetary pressures currently facing the sector. Perhaps when Tier  approvals are received, then we will see an increase in overall capital investment.” At the event, Richard Ramsey presented his annual Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index, which shows that the price of all items making up the cooked breakfast gauge rose in the year to the end of February, using the UK Retail Price Index . Milk saw the biggest price increase in the index with a rise of .% in the -months. There were also strong rises in the prices of a range of other items including eggs , butter , mushrooms , breadand sausages . Overall, the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index – the average inflation rate of the items included - rose by a robust .% in the past year, meaning that the index is at its highest level since March . This was the peak of the Ulster Fry Index and coincided with another cost-of-living crisis. Looking back even further - since the last recession , the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index has risen a whopping %. Richard Ramsey says that the Ulster Fry Index contains a more important message this year than ever. “Food makes up a signicant proportion of household spending. ‘Food and drink’ is also a key sector of the Northern Ireland economy. So, understanding how the price of food items is changing gives us some insight into both the current state of consumer finances, and also some of the challenges facing the agri-food industry,” Mr. Ramsey says. “The fact that we are now in a new cost of living crisis means that creating understanding of price rises and cost pressures and where they are coming from is essential. What the Ulster Fry Index is telling us is that the prices of everyday items like milk and bread are rising really strongly at a time whenever households are also having to contend with big rises in their household energy bills. “The reality though is that the Ulster Fry Index is only going to go one way in the foreseeable future, and that is up. Given the surge in energy prices already, alongside the disruption to the global food supply-chain stemming from the war between Russia and Ukraine, the Ulster Fry Index is expected to experience double-digit inflation over the next  months. This would see the Ulster Fry Index hit a new record high,” he continues. He adds: “Exactly this time two years ago, we thought we were entering a food crisis. People were stockpiling food items in the expectation of supply shortages and empty shelves, despite repeated reassurances from the industry and politicians. The reality was that the food and retail sectors pulled out all the stops to keep the supply lines open and to keep us fed. Today, two years on, though, a new and worrying food crisis is on the cards for dferent reasons. Russia and Ukraine are two of the most important producers and exporters of agricultural commodities in the world. Overall, the two countries export one in eight of all calories traded worldwide. What Saudi Arabia is to oil, Ukraine and Russia are to cereal crops. And don’t forget that cereal crops aren’t just a direct source of food, they are also a major indirect source of food in that they are fed to the livestock that we then consume. Food supply problems will further fuel economic nationalism due to the scramble for food security, meaning the further unwinding of globalisation, or de-globalisation. Indeed, such is the concern about the supply of food that countries are now hoarding and stockpiling by banning exports.
