[{"url":null,"title":"National Enquirer says leaker Jeff Bezos texts known mistress","story":"The Enquirer published a story last month that included lurid texts between Bezos and former TV anchor Sanchez. Bezos claimed on Thursday that AMI later threatened to expose his revealing photos if he didn\u0027t have his private investigators back off.The Amazon boss has been investigating how the tabloid obtained his private exchanges with his mistress.Bezos, who is also owner of The Washington Post, detailed his interactions with AMI, in an extraordinary blog post Thursday on Medium.com. The billionaire did not say the tabloid was seeking money - instead, he said, the Enquirer wanted him to make a public statement that the tabloid\u0027s coverage was not politically motivated. AMI\u0027s attorney defended  the tabloid\u0027s practice on Sunday, saying it was a \u0027negotiation\u0027. Abramowitz also refuted allegations the story was politically motivated because of Pecker\u0027s close friendship with President Trump, who has repeatedly railed against Bezos.  \u0027It absolutely is not extortion and not blackmail,\u0027 Abramowitz said. \u0027Bezos didn\u0027t want another story written about him or those pictures published, AMI did not want to have the libel against them that this was inspired by the White House, inspired by Saudi Arabia or inspired by The Washington Post. \u0027It had nothing to do with it. It was a usual story that National Enquirer gets from reliable sources.\u0027          Bezos claimed on Thursday that AMI later threatened to expose his revealing photos if he didn\u0027t have his private investigators back off. The Amazon boss has been investigating how the tabloid obtained his private exchanges with his mistress          Elkan Abramowitz  refused to answer when asked if the leaker was Lauren Sanchez\u0027s brother Michael. Lauren is pictured above at Santa Monica AirportWhen asked if it was a \u0027take down\u0027 to please Trump, Abramowitz replied: \u0027Any investigator knew it was not the White House.\u0027 Bezos\u0027 accusations from earlier in the week added another twist to the high-profile clash between the world\u0027s richest man and the leader of America\u0027s best-known tabloid. Bezos\u0027 investigators have suggested the Enquirer\u0027s coverage of his affair - which included the release of risque texts - was driven by dirty politics. \u0027Of course I don\u0027t want personal photos published, but I also won\u0027t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption,\u0027 Bezos wrote of AMI, in explaining his decision to go public. \u0027I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\u0027 AMI has admitted in the past that it engaged in what\u0027s known as \u0027catch-and-kill\u0027 practices to help Trump become president. Trump has been highly critical of Bezos and the Post\u0027s coverage of the White House. The Bezos affair became public when the Enquirer published a January 9 story about his relationship with Sanchez, a former TV anchor who is also married. Bezos then hired a team of private investigators to find out how the tabloid got the texts and photos the two exchanged.Several days ago, someone at AMI told Bezos\u0027 team that the company\u0027s CEO David Pecker was \u0027apoplectic\u0027 about the investigation, Bezos said. AMI later approached Bezos\u0027 representatives with an offer.  American Media has defended their dealings with billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in a statement, saying the company \u0027acted lawfully\u0027 (AMI owner David Pecker on left, Chief Content Creator Dylan Howard on right)          The National Enquirer\u0027s cover story on Bezos\u0027 orce and relationship with Sanchez \u0027They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn\u0027t stop our investigation,\u0027 Bezos wrote.Bezos wrote that this week, the tabloid\u0027s editor, Dylan Howard, emailed an attorney for Bezos\u0027 longtime security consultant to describe photos the Enquirer \u0027obtained during our newsgathering.\u0027 The photos include a \u0027below the belt selfie\u0027 of Bezos, photos of him in tight boxer-briefs and wearing only a towel, and several revealing photos of Sanchez, according to the emails Bezos released.According to the emails, an attorney for AMI offered a formal deal Wednesday: The tabloid wouldn\u0027t post the photos if Bezos and his investigators would release a public statement \u0027affirming that they have no knowledge or basis\u0027 to suggest the Enquirer\u0027s coverage was \u0027politically motivated or influenced by political forces.\u0027Bezos said he decided to publish the emails sent to his team \u0027rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail,\u0027 despite the \u0027personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.\u0027In its initial story, the Enquirer said reporters followed Bezos and Sanchez \u0027across five states and 40,000 miles\u0027 and \u0027tailed them in private jets, swanky limos, helicopter rides, romantic hikes, five-star hotel hideaways, intimate dinner dates and \u0027quality time\u0027 in hidden love nests.\u0027It reported that Bezos sent \u0027sleazy text messages and gushing love notes\u0027 to Sanchez, months before Bezos announced he was splitting up with his wife, MacKenzie."},{"url":null,"title":"Christian Louboutin wins landmark victory copycat shoes","story":"    Christian Louboutin won a seven-year disputeLuxury footwear designer Christian Louboutin has won a landmark victory over claims a rival was ripping off its distinctive red-soled shoes.Following a seven-year dispute, Dutch shoemaker Van Haren has been ordered to stop selling copycat versions of the upmarket high heels.Louboutin has been locked in a legal battle with Van Haren since 2012 after discovering the retailer was selling high-heeled shoes with red soles.The shade used by Louboutin is trademarked in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.Last year Van Haren argued that the trademark is invalid because EU law does not allow shapes in trademarks -

It was too dangerous after my heart attacks’          Mr Markle says he only asked for help to move house and that any ‘modest’ financial gifts from Meghan were ‘greatly appreciated’          Her father says: ‘I didn’t stop answering my phone. I was in hospital with a heart attack! Meg and Harry knew what was going on’          Mr Markle comments: ‘I have no idea what this means. This is pure Harry. Americans don’t use the “rabbit hole” expression’          Meghan complains Thomas sided with her half-sister Samantha in criticising her, but he insists: ‘I never wanted Meg to suffer.’Trussell also highlighted the embellishments in Meghan\u0027s handwriting, including the strokes that sweep across the tops of words. She said: \u0027They look like little protective umbrellas, giving further credence to her deep feelings on the matter. \u0027They also reveal her vulnerability - the chink in her armour. Surely this is enough proof how much Meghan cares? It must be exhausting for her!\u0027In the letter Meghan admonishes her father, in anguished tones, for siding with her half-sister Samantha – who has attacked her in the press – while she ‘silently suffered at the hand of her vicious lies’.She goes on to complain that Mr Markle has made no attempt to contact her – and chastises him for falsely telling journalists he is the one who has been shunned – a criticism her father vehemently refutes.She also accuses her father of snubbing her and Prince Harry’s offers to help when he pulled out of attending their wedding following two heart attacks and accuses him of being ungrateful for money she has given him.The former award-winning Hollywood lighting director, who now lives in Mexico, said that he never intended to make the handwritten missive public ‘out of respect for Meghan’ – but says he has been forced to do so now because its contents have been falsely portrayed.Contrary to claims made by the Duchess’s friends, he said the letter made no attempt to heal their bitter rift. ‘I thought it would be an olive branch.

The issue with her father is an open wound and I’m not entirely sure it is the best idea to aggravate that.’Last night, Mr Markle said it was unfair for his daughter’s friends to use the media to ‘spin a line’ while he was being criticised for ‘giving a handful’ of interviews to the press. In the article last Wednesday, the Duchess’s friends said that she was devastated by his response to the letter, in which he suggested father and daughter pose for press pictures.One friend said: ‘She feels like “that’s the opposite of what I’m saying. I’m telling you that I don’t want to communicate through the media, and you’re asking me to… Did you hear anything I said?” ’Mr Markle said he had suggested the photo op as a way of showing the world they could be friends again, describing the Duchess’s reading of it as ‘tragic misunderstanding’ he wishes he could put straight. The rift between the Duchess and her father began after The Mail on Sunday revealed, just days before her wedding in May last year, that he had colluded with the paparazzi to stage a series of lucrative photo opportunities.Such was his humiliation that he offered to pull out of attending the Royal Wedding and was later prevented from going after suffering two heart attacks.Since then, he has given a series of damaging interviews in which he has spoken of his dismay at being cast adrift by his daughter and the Royal Family.Emma Bache\u0027s first book, Reading Between The Lines, is published by Quercus on the 30th of August 2018.             Thomas\u0027s Anguished Reply           The Duchess insisted she phoned him, but he had no missed calls          Mr Markle says he never attacked Harry, but feels he should have met him before the wedding          Mr Markle insists his bid to reduce press intrusion was ‘completely misinterpreted’      "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry seen time Meghans devastating letters","story":"    The Duke of Sussex alongside French Rugby Federation president Bernard Laporte in the Twickenham stands before England\u0027s Six Nations clash against France today             The royal was stood next to Rugby Football Union president Chris Kelly (left) as he sang the National Anthem  with the home crowd   Make like Meghan in a monochrome dress by GivenchyShop the brandThere is no doubt  the Duchess of Sussex has built an impressive fashion portfolio since joining the Royal Family.

The 2016 documentary claims that Apollonius may have been the son of God: he was born around the same time as Jesus Christ, and preached the same things\u0027Aurelian the Roman Emperor vowed to erect temples and statues to his honour. Was there ever anything among men more holy?\u0027He reportedly restored life to the dead and spoke of things beyond the human reach.

He also took aim at her stepfather Danny Peat (right at the inquest today)  Kelly Peat  had put her daughter Amber\u0027s disappearance down to \u0027attention-seeking\u0027 and had believed she would come back, an inquest has heardHe then asked him: \u0027Making Amber wash the dishes all the time, did you ever consider her emotional well-being?\u0027Danny replied: \u0027I saw her as my daughter, but obviously kids do have to have some sort of discipline in place. I didn\u0027t think washing pots was a massive thing.\u0027Adrian then asked if it was \u0027neglectful\u0027 that they had waited so long to report Amber missing.          Kelly Peat was pictured at her daughter\u0027s inquest in Nottingham todayDanny replied: \u0027I wasn\u0027t worried. I just assumed she would walk through the door. That she had had a strop and walked out and would be back soon.\u0027  Nottingham Coroner\u0027s Court has heard allegations the 13-year-old was \u0027heavily sanctioned\u0027 for \u0027undesirable behaviour\u0027 – including being told to wash every pot in the kitchen and being woken at 10.30pm and forced to mop the floors. Earlier, Amber Peat\u0027s mother denied her daughter had wanted to kill herself and instead claimed the teenager was taking part in a self-harming \u0027competition\u0027 at school.Kelly Peat said her 13-year-old child\u0027s intention was to \u0027mark herself\u0027 rather than take her own life  when she was found hanged in bushes in Mansfield.She said today: \u0027We thought she was going to come back. I was just giving her time to calm down\u0027. Amber\u0027s mother also told the Nottingham inquest into her death that she had smashed her daughter\u0027s phone with a hammer during one big row.She also admitted they would \u0027butt heads\u0027 over household chores but denied allegations that the 13-year-old was made to get up out of bed at 10.30pm and clean the floors for three hours.Mrs Peat also sobbed as she knocked back allegations made by Amber\u0027s youth worker that she laughed when her daughter gave her a note saying \u0027I just want to be your little girl again\u0027.            Amber was found dead in this hedgerow in Mansfield - but her mother believes she had not meant to hang herselfLast week a police officer claimed that Mrs Peat showed \u0027no emotion\u0027 after the 13-year-old fled and gave \u0027rehearsed\u0027 information to police before putting Amber\u0027s disappearance down to \u0027attention-seeking\u0027. The 37-year-old added she didn\u0027t believe her daughter intending to kill herself – and instead wanted to possibly to \u0027make a mark to show her friends\u0027.Mrs Peat said: \u0027There was a lot of competition at school at that time with self-harming when kids were cutting themselves and harming themselves.\u0027I think she had every intention of coming home.\u0027Ms Bower told Mrs Peat that she\u0027d seen or heard nothing in the evidence about a \u0027self-harming competition\u0027 – and suggested it was \u0027odd\u0027 that Amber would have it on her mind when she was angry after the cool box row.            Daniel Peat said to police that Amber\u0027s her \u0027only hobby was reading and she had no real friends\u0027But Mrs Peat replied: \u0027I am just saying what I was aware of at that time.\u0027She went on to deny claims Amber had been harshly punished at home for bad behaviour – and said it was her OWN choice to wear baggy jogging bottoms to school, an incident the inquest has previously heard made her the subject of ridicule from other children.Mrs Peat added the incident came about when she told Amber to pick something to go to school in after realising she had no clean school trousers.She said: \u0027They didn\u0027t look like uniform but she would not take them off. She could be very headstrong when she wanted to be.\u0027The mother told the hearing that other incidents that had been mentioned in evidence were untrue. She said Amber had never shown her a letter that she claimed to have written with a school support worker that read \u0027I just want to be your little girl again\u0027.And she denied Amber had been forced to mop the floors at night, or clean every pot in her kitchen, by Mr Peat – saying she had \u0027no idea\u0027 why the youngster would make up the \u0027stories\u0027.However, Mrs Peat DID admit smashing up Amber\u0027s phone with a hammer in January 2015, four months before her death – but said it was because she and a sibling had refused to confess to \u0027stealing and lying\u0027.She also refuted allegations that Amber had been told \u0027what goes on in this house stays in this house\u0027, adding: \u0027The only time I asked her not to say anything to her friends was when Danny was going to prison (for tax fraud in 2014) and I did not want her to get bullied at school.\u0027Mrs Peat said she had known her husband since the age of 12, and claimed the couple had first dated in 2009 before beginning a serious relationship in early 2013 after she and Amber\u0027s natural dad split up a month earlier.Within a few weeks they had moved in together and become engaged. Ms Bower asked Mrs Peat: \u0027In the space of a few weeks Amber had seen her dad leave home, a new man move in, you lived together as a family and become engaged. With the benefit of hindsight, was that a lot for a 10-year-old to take on board in a short space of time?\u0027Mrs Peat replied: \u0027Yes, but they already knew Danny and I thought it was time for a fresh start.\u0027She said her daughter and husband \u0027butted heads\u0027 at times, and it would often \u0027come to a point where Danny would say \u0027you talk to her, she is not listening to me\u0027.\u0027Alarm bells\u0027 were ringing at school over \u0027Cinderella\u0027 girl,...\u0027Cinderella\u0027 schoolgirl Amber Peat, 13, who ran away from...Tragic schoolgirl, 13, found hanged in a bush was LAUGHED at...Social worker says she felt there was \u0027no immediate risk\u0027 to...\u0027I haven\u0027t got anything happy to write about\u0027: What...Girl, 13, made \u0027running away list\u0027 before she fled her home...Share this articleIt is believed she was already dead by the time they called in the police. The last man to see her alive told detectives turned up at his door two days after he reported it to them.Adam Lamb said the police asked if they could walk to where he last spotted Amber at 5.20pm on May 30 2015 and she was found hanging in the hedgerow nearby.The coroner has been told the vulnerable teenager was being \u0027emotionally abused\u0027 at home and subjected to a series of draconian punishments for \u0027undesirable behaviour\u0027.On one occasion, she claimed she had been been awoken by her stepfather at 1.30am and told to mop floors as a punishment for failing to fulfil domestic chores. Amber vanished at around 5.10pm – but wasn\u0027t reported missing until 12.56am the following day, after her parents had their dinner and went shopping.Tragically  she was already dead by that point.PC Nicola Roe was one of the first officers to respond to the missing persons call from Kelly Peat.She went to the family home with a colleague and was told by the 37-year-old that Amber had stormed out of the house after being asked to clean out a cool box.           Kelly Peat, and step father Danny Peat appeal for missing Amber to come home - but by that time she was already dead          The family did not report Amber missing until they had \u0027been to Tesco and had their tea\u0027. Pictured above the missing poster which was put up once it had been reported that Amber was missing Asked by coroner Laurinda Bower for her observations about Kelly, PC Roe replied: \u0027She was quite matter-of-fact about how she was describing the situation.\u0027  Amber Peat wrote to her mother Kelly  telling her: \u0027I just wanted to be you little girl again\u0027 - but she laughed at it, the inquest heard previouslyThe officer said she \u0027wasn\u0027t really surprised\u0027 because \u0027people present differently\u0027, adding: \u0027She seemed tired but not particularly emotional. Not upset, maybe frustrated.\u0027She explained the background that she had gone missing previously in similar circumstances, and referred to her throwing temper tantrums and attention-seeking behaviour.\u0027PC Roe said the family \u0027seemed quite well rehearsed in giving information to the police\u0027, and \u0027the general consensus was they expected her back the next morning\u0027.She added: \u0027They said she normally came back at night and that is why they left it quite late to report it.\u0027In extraordinary scenes last week Amber\u0027s biological father was described as \u0027nothing but a sperm donor\u0027 and subjected to \u0027vile abuse by her stepdad\u0027, he told the inquest into his daughter\u0027s death. Adrian Cook found out about the 13-year-old\u0027s disappearance on Facebook and tried to contact her mother, Kelly Peat, for information, but was bombarded with angry insults from Danny Peat.Danny Peat told Amber\u0027s estranged father: \u0027She is not your f****** daughter.

From that moment on, the world of aviation would never be the same again.Since the first flight of the Boeing 747 half a century ago, the jumbo has transported 3.5 billion passengers as well as billions of tons of cargo all around the planet — including another aviation icon, the Space Shuttle, which was ferried around America on the back of a jumbo.More than any other aircraft, the jumbo jet, with its ability to transport around 600 passengers over 8,000 miles at just under the speed of sound, has shrunk the world.It also ushered in an age of luxury in the skies: glamorous air stewardesses who offered a smile as they marshalled food trolleys up the aisle serving filet mignon from an a la carte menu cocktails served to sharply dressed businessmen wreathed in cigar smoke.This was a time when commercial flights were a holiday in themselves. But now, 50 years later, the jumbo is slowly disappearing from our skies.Although nearly 1,600 have been built since 1969, there are only around 500 still flying.British Airways, Boeing\u0027s biggest jumbo customer, has only 34 in the air, with a further 36 in storage. By 2024, the airline will have stopped flying them altogether.Dutch airline KLM is also phasing them out, while Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines are now only using 747s — which weigh 435 tons at full-capacity — as cargo planes.You do not need to be an aeroplane anorak to find this a little sad. Many of us have an enormous affection for the jumbo, and no matter how many times you fly on one, you still can\u0027t help but be impressed by its size.The jumbo\u0027s demise is no fault of its age. Boeing is still producing planes even today, with some 24 orders for the latest cargo version — the 747-8F — on its books. Its problem lies in its cost.On a practical level, it is now possible to fly around 400 passengers across the Atlantic on two engines, and it makes little financial sense to fly 600 people the same distance on the jumbo\u0027s four.Environmental tariffs and landing fees levied by airports have also dramatically increased.Landing a jumbo at full capacity at Heathrow costs around £12,500. Of that, nearly £4,000 is in environmental tariffs, whereas for a Boeing 787, which can take around 330 passengers, that tariff is around £1,000.With airlines operating at such tight margins, it is far more economical to fly two 787s from, say, New York to London, than one jumbo jet.But while the jumbo\u0027s days might be numbered, it certainly had an extraordinarily good run.After all, its creators thought all long-haul aircraft would be supersonic by the Seventies, and planned to phase it out after a decade. Many at Boeing didn\u0027t even think the jumbo would last that long, given its birth was beset by myriad problems. The eventual choice of engine, made by Pratt \u0026amp Whitney and known as the JT9D, was a particular cause for concern.It suffered from power surges and had a tendency to stall — hardly ideal characteristics for any plane, let alone one as large as the 747.The JT9D\u0027s blades also rubbed against the bottom of the engine casing, which not only made it underperform, but was also potentially lethal if it destroyed the engine.    The Space Shuttle Orbiter is mounted on top of a Boeing 747 carrier aircraft and flown. The first landing test took place on 12th August 1977          The Space Shuttle Endeavour lifts off just just after sunrise on the first leg of its journey back to the Kennedy Space Center atop a Boeing 747 carrier aircraft          The Space Shuttle Discovery sits on top of  NASA\u0027s modified Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft as the aircraft takes flight from with Edwards Air Force Base in CaliforniaAnother large problem was the basic design of the plane, which was intended to have two decks.But during testing, they found it impossible to evacuate the plane within the required 90 seconds, and, worse still, people actually broke bones at they slid down escape chutes a few storeys high.As a result, the size of the top deck was reduced. But despite such problems, on September 30, 1968, the first 747 was rolled out to meet the press and public.To the tune of Elgar\u0027s Pomp and Circumstance, it emerged from its hangar, its red and white livery gleaming in the sun.Despite the fact that the 747 had never flown, the plane boasted the insignia of the 26 airlines that had already placed orders. Accompanying the plane — which would be called City of Everett — were female cabin crew from each of the airlines, who somewhat haphazardly smashed bottles of champagne against the fuselage.When the test flight took place just over four months later, the plane was treated somewhat better. Pilot Jack Waddell only tried the most gentle manoeuvres, and was delighted to find the 747 handled well.But, looking at the temperature gauge in the cockpit, he noticed that — for some unknown reason — one of the Pratt \u0026amp Whitney engines was running some 30 degrees hotter than the others. Rather than panic, Waddell coolly decided to continue to climb, and the engines suffered no further issues.But, several minutes later, Waddell lowered the wings\u0027 flaps and the three-strong crew heard a strange thud.Something was emphatically not right and, after a quick investigation by chief engineer Jess Wallick, it emerged that part of the flaps on the starboard wing had worked loose. This was a reason for ending the flight and, after one hour and 16 minutes, Waddell made the jumbo\u0027s first ever landing.Despite the glitches, the test flight was judged a success, and just under a year later — on January 21, 1970 — 336 passengers sat in Pan Am\u0027s Clipper of America to take the first commercial jumbo flight, from New York to London.Its lift-off was somewhat stunted, however. As the plane taxied down the runway, the pilot noted the exhaust temperature from one engine was too high. Deciding that safety was more important than public relations, he returned to the terminal.Unsurprisingly, the passengers, all of whom had paid $375 for their tickets — about $5,000 today — were thoroughly annoyed.Luckily, there was a spare 747, the Clipper Victor, which Pan Am had received only the day before. The passengers switched planes and touched down at London Heathrow just six hours and 16 minutes later.Since 1970, the 747 has had, well, many ups and downs. The plane has been involved in nearly 150 accidents and incidents, most of which have been caused by human error, or terrorism.In total, 3,746 people have died in jumbo jets. That may sound high, but it represents just 0.0001 per cent of all those who have flown on the 747.Tragic though those deaths undoubtedly are, there is much we should celebrate about the jumbo.It has carried everything from American presidents to pregnant livestock, and even though we will see less of her, she will continue to fly for many years to come.She is unlikely to survive another 50 years, but when she does land for the final time, she will never be forgotten.Boeing 747 — A History: Delivering The Dream by Martin Bowman is published by Pen \u0026amp Sword.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Welsh star Aaron Ramsey agrees 400 000 WEEK deal Britains highest paid footballer","story":"    Childhood sweethearts: Aaron Ramsey and wife Colleen at the \u0027Don\u0027t Take Me Home\u0027 film premiere, London, 2017Oscars 2019: Lady Gaga and Amy Adams lead the largest class...EXCLUSIVE: Convicted pedophile who confessed to killing...Share this article    Ramsey and Colleen (pictured) married  in 2014 and had their first child, Sonny, the following year  In October, Colleen, who describes herself as an ‘enthusiastic foodie’ on Instagram, gave birth to twin boysDuring that time he has won the FA Cup three times, twice scoring the winner – against Hull in 2014 and against Chelsea in 2017.His eye-watering pre-contract agreement to join Juventus in the summer is a result of the Turin side not having to pay Arsenal a transfer fee because Ramsey’s contract expires then.Ramsey grew up in the South Wales town of Caerphilly and met wife Colleen Rowlands at Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni, a Welsh-speaking school where he was a champion athlete and obtained ten GCSEs.

Money, said: ‘The alarming rate of cashpoint and bank closures risks leaving people facing an uphill battle to access the cash they rely on. Cash is also a vital back-up as fallible digital payments grow in popularity. So the Government must appoint a regulator to oversee these changes and ensure no one is excluded.’Mike Cherry, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘The rapid pace of bank and cashpoint closures is hurting small businesses.          At the same time, banks are closing more branches to cut costs, with more than 3,300 being axed since 2015‘Millions of small firms have customers who want to pay using notes and coins. The majority of shoppers either use cash frequently or want to see access to it maintained. Bank branches and cashpoints create a natural draw for high streets. They give shoppers a reason to visit.‘When bank branches and cashpoints are lost, local growth often takes a hit. It’s time for a regulator to be given responsibility for protecting access to notes and coins.’Natalie Ceeney, chairman of the Access To Cash Review – an independent probe into the future of money – said: ‘For millions of people in the UK, cash is not a choice, it’s a necessity. If we don’t plan for a world of lower cash – if we sleepwalk into a cashless society – millions of people will be left behind.’The ATM network is run by the Link organisation, which has a duty to ensure all communities have access. It said: ‘We agree with Which? – free access to cash is vital for consumers. As payment habits change, the UK needs to work out how to maintain cash access.’The Payments Systems Regulator – an offshoot of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority – has a role in policing electronic payments.

A Dispatches investigation aired by Channel 4 last night claimed ministers are so alarmed by HS2’s price that they are ‘increasingly minded to kill off the scheme’.The report claimed ministers fear HS2 will cost up to £6billion a year over the next decade – equivalent to Network Rail’s annual budget to maintain and upgrade Britain’s entire rail infrastructure.It also suggested officials believe HS2 easily exceed its current £59billion budget.Mrs Leadsom’s letter raised Mr Thurston’s admission that HS2 may run slower and less frequent trains in order to save costs and stick to its £56billion budget. Last month it emerged that officials have considered plans to lower train speeds of up to 225mph by around 30mph and reduce the number of trains per hour in both directions from 18 to 14.Mrs Leadsom said her constituents had warned that if the speed of the HS2 line was reduced to 186mph – in line with the top speed for Eurostar – this would shave just 15 minutes from the current journey time between London and Birmingham on the West Coast Main Line.HS2 had promised to cut the time taken for this journey by about half an hour, from one hour 21 minutes to 49 minutes.    A Dispatches investigation aired by Channel 4 last night claimed ministers are so alarmed by HS2’s price that they are ‘increasingly minded to kill off the scheme’.

But yesterday the Prime Minister’s spokesman dismissed claims that HS2 could be scrapped or scaled back, and said the organisation was working to control costs.Rachael Maskell, Labour’s rail spokesman, said the Department for Transport needs to ‘get a grip on HS2’s costs urgently’ and set out a detailed plan for the costs for MPs to review.A spokesman for the troubled rail project said: ‘HS2 continues to work to the scope and budget requirements that have been set out by government.’j.salmon@dailymail.co.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"The British cities faster cycle drive","story":"    It\u0027s now faster to cycle than drive in some city centres as Britain’s roads become increasingly gridlocked, a report has found (pictured, M6 Junction 10 at Walsall, West Midlands)It concluded that it has become ‘faster to ride a bike than drive or take the bus’ for millions of motorists in Britain.It found that last year drivers in six UK cities – London, Edinburgh, Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield – crawled along at an average speed of 10mph or less in the last mile of their journey.

Donald Trump has told Americans his administration had accelerated talks for a political settlement in Afghanistan and would be able to reduce US troops there as negotiations advance to end America’s longest war.No one knows what form a new government may take or how much control the Taliban might have under any deal, but for young people who were babies when the Taliban were driven from power by a US-led campaign in 2001, the prospect of peace with the hardline Islamists brings a daunting mix of hope and fear.For villagers in rural Afghanistan, where traditional ways have always counted for more than central government law, life may not change much. But for the young of Kabul and other cities, there is much to lose, in particular the freedoms restored after the Taliban were ousted – from playing music, to modelling and adopting trendy haircuts – which they’ve grown up with.“The thing I’m most worried about is that if they return, I’ll not be able to continue playing music,” said a 16-year-old pianist who attends music school in Kabul.  “It will be great if the government and the Taliban reach a peace deal. At that time there should be access to music for everyone and women’s rights must be protected.”When the Taliban were last in power, they gained global notoriety for a harsh regime that forced women and girls to stay at home, restricted music and sports and imposed brutal punishment on infractions of a hardline version of Islamic law. More recently, they have adopted a more moderate tone, including pledges on rights for women and girls’ education, appeals for support from foreign aid groups and promises to maintain good international relations.While huge doubts remain, the peace talks have given young people a sense of hope.  “I am optimistic about the Taliban joining the peace process,” said Hussain, 19, who like many young Afghans grew up in neighbouring Iran where millions have taken refuge from war. He now works as a hairdresser in Kabul. “It will be an end to the war and conflicts in our country. I want the Taliban to change their policy and not behave like before.”They have also had to deal with near-daily violence and a broken economy that cannot provide jobs for the 400,000 or so new entrants to the workforce every year. Hundreds of thousands have migrated in the years since 2014, when most foreign forces left. Many have risked dangerous journeys in search of new homes in countries such as Turkey, or in Europe or further afield. For some of those who have remained, there is now hope that peace will bring opportunities.Women’s rights have improved in recent years under the western-backed Afghan government, especially in cities such as the capital Kabul, where many women work outside the home and more than a quarter of the parliament is female.The male generational gap may be explained by younger men seeking rigid gender roles as they struggle to find work and stability in a country ravaged by war and poverty, said gender equality group Promundo. Religious teachings against women’s rights under the Taliban regime had also played a role in hardening views among younger men.Sultan Qasim Sayeedi, an 18-year-old model scours Facebook, YouTube and Instagram to learn about fashion and modelling, and draws inspiration from his favourite models, including Saudi Arabia’s Omar Borkan, and Canadian popstar Justin Bieber. “We’re afraid that if the Taliban come then we will not be able to hold our shows,” he said. Despite that wariness, Sultan says it’s time the fighting ended. “If American troops will go peace will come, we want peace,” he said.Maryam Ghulami, a 20-year-old living in the western province of Herat, says her generation will bring change that her parents never could. She is learning graphic design and computer coding at an online academy and likes to hone her skills with YouTube tutorials. While she believes Afghanistan faces many problems – a slow and unreliable internet connection, for a start – she has faith that her generation can bring change. “The new generation can change Afghanistan with knowledge, with technology,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e53fb65485b10071e1d2fbe832faf9295d14f4a2/1654_662_2180_1308/master/2180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa9de31ab1e67e2b2c79d8c9ef953454","title":"the freedom artist ben okri review","story":"The notion of the human condition as a prison or a dream state runs through western literature, from Plato through to Boethius, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Calderón de la Barca and all the way to Kafka, Camus, Borges and plenty more. Ben Okri’s 11th novel, The Freedom Artist, invokes all these preceding stories in a multilayered allegorical narrative that cuts to the heart of our current political and cultural malaise, while maintaining a mythical, mesmeric flavour that makes the reader feel these are stories they have always known.In a 2018 interview with the , Okri described his life project as trying to do something new with “that great oceanic tide of African fables and stories that I grew up on – what I call the vast invisible literature”. This image – of an invisible literature that permeates the collective consciousness – becomes literal reality in The Freedom Artist – inasmuch as anything in a magic realist world can be described as literal.One narrative thread is set in a society similar to our own, but in a world from which books have disappeared: “Gradually people stopped reading. Even the machines invented to make reading easier and portable fell into disuse… People simply stopped reading the ancient classics. Then they couldn’t read anything that required a little thought. Then they couldn’t read anything but the simplest books. Then all they read were newspapers of the popular variety. Literacy vanished from the world, along with bookshops.”This could sound like a rather heavy-handed satire on the state of literary culture from a writer who is now part of its old guard, but in the context of the story, such a recognisable erosion of reading and independent thought is chilling. “Storytellers sometimes see things before they have been experienced,” the novel tells us, darkly.In this Orwellian society in which myths are rewritten, questions forbidden and questioners disappeared, there are those who preserve the old stories in secret. One such is the unnamed father of a girl called Ruslana, a Prospero-like figure who has shut himself away with a basement full of books that he turns into holograms before they are destroyed.When he is taken away, Ruslana is left as  of these shadow books. In turn, she comes into contact with a young man named Karnak, jolted from complacency by the disappearance of his lover, Amalantis, an enigmatic beauty with connections to the mysterious question that keeps appearing scrawled on walls or dropped in pamphlets from the sky: “Who is the prisoner?”Okri builds his story in apparently disparate fragments that gradually cohere to build a picture of a society sleepwalking towards tearing itself apart, just as people in the novel find the old myths – those that have been rewritten by the authorities – saved in fragments and images. The pared-back style often feels closest in tone to the Fictions of Borges. Character takes second place to symbolism few of them are named, and those who are embody representative qualities, like figures from myth. It is often repetitive, in a way that reflects the historic cycle of hope and disillusion, as the people flock to rumours of warrior heroes and Messiah figures who might save them.“Sometimes it takes an image to wake a nation from its secret shame,” Okri wrote in his 2017 poem Grenfell Tower. The Freedom Artist elaborates on this idea. An image – a rose pressed anonymously into the hand, a smile glimpsed in the street – or a question, or a single word could startle sleepwalkers into consciousness.It is possible to read particular instances of current affairs or recent history into The Freedom Artist, but this is not a book that is so easily pinned down. It’s savagely political, disturbing and fiercely optimistic, the deeply felt work of a writer who refuses to stop asking the hardest questions. • The Freedom Artist by Ben Okri is published by Head of Zeus (£14.99).

At first, they beguile you. Then the drink flows, tongues loosen, fingers wag and the evening degenerates. I have been on both sides of the table. I have wagged and been wagged at so often I know the danger signs. Nowhere are they more evident than in today’s lectures on how liberals “just don’t get it”.Yael Tamir offers an upmarket version of contemporary cliches. She is more wine bar than saloon bar, although, as the glasses are downed, the distinction between the two blurs. Tamir is from the subgenre of former or self-declared liberals and leftists. She was an anti-war activist in the Israeli Peace Now movement and like Blue Labour in Britain, the Prospect founder David Goodhart and a significant faction in the leftwing press, she speaks to liberals more in sorrow than anger. To begin with, at least. She believes nationalist movements can be exploited for social democratic aims and deliver economic patriotism and social responsibility rather than, say, attacks on foreigners and stagnation.Her case starts uncontroversially to anyone who has read the work of Ernest Gellner, Benedict Anderson or, indeed, thought about nations and nationality without reference to academic work. I did not need to be told that all nations must define their boundaries or that national identity ties strangers together. It was not news that there is only so much ersity any society can take. And when Tamir tells us that from the 19th century the state created nationality as it “built schools, taught the national language and spread national culture”, my first thought was: “Really, have you only just noticed?”The first sign that we may need to call her a cab comes when she slips uncritically into the language of Steve Bannon. Before the election of Donald Trump and the Brexit vote, “globalists” dominated politics. By “globalist”, she does not mean the handful of bankers and executives who can move from excessively well-remunerated job to job but hundreds of millions of voters in the west who live in cities and have broadly liberal instincts. The casual misuse of language matters because it allows her to dismiss vast numbers as corporate elitists when in truth they are no more likely to fly to Davos than to the moon.They voted for parties that “emptied the public sphere of ideological and motivational forces that could promote social solidarity and encourage the erection of mechanisms necessary to combat social alienation”, she proclaims as she reflects a nostalgia for the lost communities of the rural and industrial west she never knew. Is this a fair description of Labour Britain from 1997 to 2010, which I recall spent billions on combating social alienation by building everything from Sure Start centres to a generous system of pensioner benefits? Tamir does not say. Although she is a professor at the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government, she seems to feel no pressing obligation to provide anything resembling evidence.The vulnerable rightly feel “those who exploit cheap labour and natural resources overseas portray themselves as moral universalists”, she continues, “while those defending their jobs are portrayed as narrow-minded bigots”. There is undoubted resentment that opposition to immigration is portrayed as racism when every country in the world has immigration controls, but who believes in a free for all apart from a handful of powerless commentators?Alas, there’s no stopping her. “Nationalism waters our memories, interprets our dreams and does not allow us to shrink into solitude,” she says as she sinks into a maudlin reverie. Do you want to hear Churchill’s Battle of Britain speeches or Henry V on the eve on Agincourt? Yet again? She repeats them anyway. Do you want to know why Remain lost the Brexit referendum? Because the “British Labour party, like many other progressive leaders around the world, was closer to the elites than to the people”. The professor does not seem to know that the British Labour party in 2016 was led by Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong anti-European, who has opposed his members’ demands for a second referendum ever since.There is a wider intellectual fault that goes beyond the work of one author. Too many regard today’s crisis as an end rather than a beginning. Rather than fight, they accept. The majority of MPs in the British Labour and Tory parties know that Brexit is a national mistake. The patriotic course for all who love their country is to stop it. Instead of fighting, however, they stay silent and play along. The people have spoken, they say. We dare not argue back.Dissent and opposition become impossible in these circumstances. As does a clear understanding of the world. At one point, Tamir declares that “liberalism is loneliness” and leaves us “bawling” into a void. If this were the case, then in Brexit Britain, Trump’s America and Orbán’s Hungary we ought by now to see evidence that nationalism is rebuilding solidarity and ending isolation. Couples should be staying together. Communities should be flourishing. No such evidence exists. Of course it doesn’t, but if you talk as if it does you will fail to hold reactionaries to account.A first step in imposing accountability is to insist on the honesty that the right of the Tory and left of the Labour party cannot manage. Leaving the EU, slashing immigration, allowing nationalism to “water our memories” will hurt. Before throwing your punches, you must ask the public’s permission to inflict the pain and specify who will suffer, whose services will be cut and whose futures blighted.I think it is fair to say that the losers will not include visiting professors at Oxford.

Well, there are a number of rules. You should not have too many paintings of “strong, iconic” but single women in your home cacti are bad because they’re “too spiky”.Bedrooms should be “a boudoir to welcome a man into”, where he feels comfortable and “not squashed out by anything else”. We’d already been told that men can feel threatened by confident women, women earning more than men and women expecting pleasure from sex but “menacing bedside furniture” is a new one.Speaking of bedrooms – books apparently aren’t allowed in there, as they are a room for “sleep and love”. This raises some questions. Does it mean that if you like reading a book in bed you must then go put it back elsewhere in the house just before falling asleep? Is one book (singular) in the bedroom fine but two or more forbidden? What if you do find a partner thanks to your attractive new flat and he also enjoys reading in bed, does this create a loophole? Should you read this singular book together at the same time? Any word on Kindles?Roynon doesn’t expand on these particular quandaries, but does offer more advice on books. As it turns out, a single woman in search of companionship should not own novels with “depressing titles” like Little Deaths or The Suspect.This presumably means that sad or brutal novels with deceptively cheerful titles are AOK. Jonathan Littell’s Holocaust fiction bestseller might have a scene where a soldier bashes the head of a newborn child against a kitchen counter, but it is called The Kindly Ones so on the happy shelf it goes.It is also telling that when it comes to books, we are left with a number of don’ts but no do’s – what we read cannot be in view when we fall asleep and cannot (seem to) be a bummer, but that’s pretty much it.Perhaps we should try to go further. If you are a single woman and would like a man to come to your flat and not run away weeping and screaming, why not let your book collection do the talking for you? Buy 35 copies of Chris Kraus’s I Love Dick and leave them lying around every corner of your house, in places where he will least expect it, so he is constantly reminded of the fact that you’re up for it. It doesn’t matter that the book is about a bit more than that as we’ve established, men only ever look at the covers.Or maybe put Normal People by Sally Rooney in a place where he is sure to spot it. Not only is it a good book, but it will subconsciously tell him that you are, in fact, normal. Just a normal woman, looking for a normal man, so you can be a normal couple together, living in your normal house. Normal, normal, normal. What’s not to love?Actually, scratch that: get rid of all your books. After all, looking for love should be a full-time occupation, and you have a welcoming boudoir you need to get started on. Do consider stuffing your cacti in one of the cushions if endless nonsensical relationship advice catered towards women has taught us anything, it’s that a man likes to be kept on his toes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b18e0633e4b6ac7d72b982310fc43e6b3a964b67/0_458_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40c5bfa743d6911314696e2f5ce48f15","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Colm Tóibín’s Nora Webster has been keeping vermontlogger up at night:Another first-class read. A middle-aged mother, recently widowed, must learn to live a new life and shows a brave independence. Emotion is made to appear through writing of perfect clarity and simplicity.Towards the end I had a horrible certainty as to how it would finish and lay awake worrying.Dogbertd has a different kind of worry about Tolstoy:I hesitate to mention it, but I’m almost finished War and Peace. I say hesitate, because people tend to look at you a bit funny when you say you’re reading W\u0026ampP - my wife simply said “Oh my god” as if I’d taken leave of my senses. And I also hesitate because actually I’m re-reading it. According to the date inside the cover (Penguin, 2 volumes, Tr. Edwards) I last read this in 1974, when I was clearly much too young to really appreciate it, since I remembered nothing of it except that I thought the philosophical bits rather dull.I can see now that waiting 44 years to come back to it was a serious mistake. I suppose I was put off by its length and “classic” status, but I have to say it’s a cracking good read, and I’d recommend it to anyone: I’ve hugely enjoyed it.“My God, I’m having a hoot,” says MachenBach, who has been reading Markus Werner:I’m on Zündel’s Exit which is (as you say of the other) terse and bitter, but also full of great lines and belly laughs (Hoffman did the translation). Like a funnier Bernhard. It’s hitting the spot like you wouldn’t believe.A bold sequel to A Wizard Of Earthsea - bold in that it’s initially unclear that it bears any relationship to the first novel, other than being set on the same world (if you weren’t aware of the sequel, you might not have recalled that Atuan is even mentioned in AWOE).Like several others recently, SeriouslyLentil has rediscoverd Ice by Anna Kavan, “which I read decades ago and lost”:It really is astonishing, mixing post-nuclear apocalyptic disaster (new Ice Age) with feminism, often hallucinogen at times, dreamlike and sometimes stream of consciousness from an unreliable narrator searching for a strange, ephemeral girl and as ice closes in and the world turns to shit. Details are left vague and the three protagonists are nameless. The author spent most of her life addicted to heroin so there are obvious metaphors here. The writing is beautiful and I can only compare her descriptions of the freezing world as similar to Doris Lessing’s The Making of the Representative for Planet 8.Bill Bryson’s A Walk In The Woods has worked its magic on sblejo:Describing the frustrations of ‘camping’ on the Appalachian Trail with little or no equipment, walking for miles in hopes of encountering the next small town with motel and restaurant, and the revelations of walking with his friend Katz who is in no shape to take on such a trial. All true, very enlightening, not only about human nature but about the dismal ‘care’ the U.S. National Park System and associates ‘lavish’, so to speak on unforgettable, fabulous nature, out there for any of us to partake. Of course there are always the spoiled Ralph Lauren hiking outfit types, simply out for a night of camping and extreme drinking. Altogether an entertaining, wonderfully hilarious and thought-provoking comment on society, history, nature and ourselves.Finally, NicolaVintageReads has discovered an unfortunate truth in a Raymond Chandler novel:Racing through Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe novels which I’ve never read before. Plots utterly confusing but what a great writer. I loved Marlowe’s advice on giving up alcohol:“It’s a different world. You have to get used to a paler set of colours, a quieter lot of sounds, you have to allow for relapses. All the people you used to know well will get to be a little strange. You won’t even like most of them and they won’t like you too well.”If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Four trams from four different directions. For a child on a bike that’s really confusing!”Lotta is the first junior cycle mayor in the world and her working area is the Dutch capital. It is her mission to inspire children to cycle every day and draw attention to the obstacles that kids on bikes are facing.But children who cycle in Amsterdam face challenges, Lotta says: “The three biggest problems for us are cars, cycling tourists and scooters. The cars take up too much space, the tourists are always swaying side to side and stop when you least expect it, and the scooters simply run you over.”Lotta became junior cycle mayor in June last year when she won a contest in which schoolchildren were asked to come up with plans to make cycling safer and more fun. Her idea was to add children’s bikes and tandems to the popular bike share programme run by Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS), the state-owned railway operator. “My parents don’t have a car, so when we go to another city we always take the train and then a railway-bike,” she says. “But because they don’t have bicycles for children, I have to go on the back of my father’s bike, which is a bit dangerous.”NS congratulated Lotta on her idea and offered to equip the railway station near where her grandparents live in Haarlem with a child’s bike. But the junior cycle mayor was not that easily satisfied: “I told them it was not enough. I am not bicycle mayor for myself, but for all children in Amsterdam.” NS is now considering a pilot with children’s bikes in one station.In the office of BYCS, the organisation that runs the cycle mayor programme, Lotta meets Katelijne Boerma, the cycle mayor of Amsterdam. It was Boerma’s idea to appoint a junior colleague. “There are 125,000 children in this city and I was thinking of ways how to reach them,” she says. “And then I realised, to encourage children to start cycling, you simply need a role model.”But do children in Amsterdam really need to be encouraged to jump on their bikes? Boerma thinks so. “There are people from 200 different cultures living here and some do not see the bike as a safe mode of transport. So their children go to school by bus, they ride a scooter once they are 16 and when they grow up, they go to work by car. There’s still a world to win.”Since Lotta was appointed junior cycle mayor, she has been busy, giving interviews, opening cycling contests in the city and being a jury member during the Amsterdam Light Parade, an event in which Amsterdammers decorate their bikes with lights.She is now planning a meeting with the city’s mayor to discuss ideas that children have come up with: “One of our proposals is a bicycle park where children can learn how to cycle. Right now, most of us learn it in the street, which can be quite busy. It’s much nicer when you can practise in a special park. Another idea is to create an app for tourists to teach them the rules of cycling, because most of them really don’t know.”When asked if she cycles a lot herself, she says it is so normal for her that she never really gives it a second thought: “I go to school by foot, because it is very close by, but I do many other things by bike. I cycle to my theatre class every Saturday, for example. But the traffic in Amsterdam is very busy. We really need more people to leave their cars and go by bike.”Following the success of the Amsterdam scheme, cycle mayors around the world are now planning to appoint junior colleagues. “They see it works really well,” Boerma says. “I talk to the parents, Lotta talks to the children. And if you look at the city through the eyes of a child, you will also make it accessible for others. A city that’s good for an eight-year-old is also good for an 88-year-old.”Lotta thinks it is great that more cities are following Amsterdam’s example. “Once I went on a holiday to England, to a city called Bath, and I saw there were not so many children cycling there,” she says. “They could really benefit from a junior bicycle mayor.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/594c406cbaea418b326c358859af4197b0e2a60e/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a1f021bc60b2d4b09d99611f74a22eb","title":"irish brexit northern ireland young people","story":"England’s casual indifference to the border question has betrayed the post-Troubles generationTouts are a three-piece rock band from Derry. The name is a reference to the Northern Irish colloquialism for a police informer, which is scrawled and sprayed around their home city the music they make is full of a sense of Derry’s violent past and its uneasy present. It harks back to the distant days of punk rock, but its sheer velocity also speaks of an urge to get on with the future, whatever that might be. The band are part of a lineage of music interwoven with Northern Ireland’s difficult politics and history: as the Belfast-based music writer Stuart Bailie’s brilliant book Trouble Songs puts it, raw art that has “challenged given stories” and provided “succour and a sense of collective worth”.All three Touts members were born at a time when the Troubles were receding into history two of them were too young to vote in the 2016 EU referendum. Last week, I watched them rehearse, in a freezing room on an edge-of-town industrial estate. They talked about Northern Ireland’s political predicament with the kind of incisive eloquence that most English musicians seem to have lost. “Politics is just inescapable, coming from here,” said 21-year-old bassist and co-vocalist, Luke McLaughlin. “If you have a platform, you may as well say something.”The band’s drummer, Jason Feenan, 19, mentioned a video he had seen online of the then-Brexit secretary Dominic Raab being questioned by the Northern Irish MP Sylvia Hermon, and awkwardly admitting that he had never made time to read the Good Friday agreement. “Every household in the North has a copy of it,” Feenan marvelled. “You could read it in a day. And someone supposedly negotiating on our behalf couldn’t even be bothered.”He looked pained. “It’s kind of Irish history repeating itself,” he said. “A decision’s made in England, and we’re just dragged along with it.”Over four very sobering days, this was a sentiment I heard time and again. After I left Derry, with ringing ears, I drove along the often labyrinthine border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, stopping to talk to people for whom that largely invisible line had been a complete irrelevance until the great convulsion of June 2016 put it back on the political agenda. Just about everyone I met knew perfectly well that Theresa May’s travails over the so-called backstop are the product of politicians and voters elsewhere forgetting about the island of Ireland, only to be reminded that for the people who live there, Brexit represents a profound set of dangers. No one was that surprised about this amnesia, but many were very angry about it.The boredom with Brexit that I have endlessly encountered in England was nowhere to be seen. Eighty-eight miles from Derry in the old port city of Newry, people talked about a place that had lived in the shadow of the old border for more than 60 years and suffered dire economic consequences, only to undergo an amazing recovery that suddenly feels fragile. Here and elsewhere, there was exasperation at the historical accident that had made Theresa May dependent on the Democratic Unionist party, whose original opposition to the Good Friday agreement still rankles and whose hostility to the backstop is a central part of Northern Ireland’s current pain. On the other side of the sectarian ide, in even the sleepiest places, I spotted newly printed posters and hoardings demanding a united Ireland, their strident tone betraying the fact that setting out on that road would inevitably trigger no end of strife.Across the sea, Brexit has triggered a certain obstinacy and aggressive nostalgia among older people, and here, you can pick up something comparable. In the tiny southern Irish border town of Clones, a sixtysomething drinker in a local bar said that Britain could have Brexit if it “gives us back the six counties”, while a younger man shook his head at the discomfiting echo of conflicts he obviously wanted to forget. In Enniskillen, a local member of the DUP who had served in the British army told me that if there was any serious attempt to unite Ireland’s two halves, “I would stand back, and get my uniform back on, and stand firm with the British.”Everywhere I went, people whose views were less entrenched asked the same set of questions. If the UK leaves Europe with no deal, and Northern Ireland and the Republic are suddenly separated by tariffs and new regulations, would that mean the return of what official-speak calls “border infrastructure”? If it did, wouldn’t that give people spoiling for a fight something to shoot at, or blow up? Whatever the prime minister’s current contortions, what if Brexit – even with a deal – and the Ireland envisaged by the Good Friday agreement turn out to be mutually exclusive?Such points were usually balanced by a set of convictions people seemed to be clinging to: that no one wants the border back, and any kind of reversal of the peace process is unthinkable. But then the unease would return as it was acknowledged that Brexit is a veritable Pandora’s box, brimming with unforeseen consequences.What lots of people understood as a matter of instinct was obvious: that in the context of the peace process, the UK’s exit from the EU is a colossal breach of trust, made infinitely worse by the fact that it has been perpetrated so casually. The guilty parties stretch from mindless Tory Brexiteers, through the Labour politicians who have accepted our exit as a given, to the kind of voters who seem to have instant recall of the distant glories of the second world war but huge blind spots when it comes to a conflict that was still rocking the UK only a quarter of a century ago.As a recent car bomb in Derry proves, the challenges of peace and stability are by no means over. Thanks to an arcane scandal about government subsidies for renewable fuels – which involved vast amounts of wasted public money – and tensions between Sinn Féin and the DUP over the Irish language, there has been no devolved government since January 2017. The damage caused to relations between Dublin and London by Brexit is hardly helping. Among people of Touts’ generation, some of the most pressing political issues centre on the fact that as the Republic has been pushed into a new era of social liberalism, Northern Ireland has been exposed as the last redoubt of very different official attitudes, where abortion remains illegal and equal marriage is still being fought for. And stark regional inequalities have yet to be tackled: for all its cultural vivacity, Derry has deep-seated problems with unemployment, and a gross median wage £69 per week lower than in Northern Ireland as a whole.All this feeds into a deep sense of anxiety and uncertainty, not least among young people who yearn to escape the pull of the past and find out what the future might hold.Touts have a song titled Bomb Scare, which, they say, juxtaposes observations of racism in the US and the European refugee crisis with the insecurities of their home turf. Its chorus sounds like a glimpse of very real fears: “Checkpoint Charlie  It’s not my heaven  It’s where we’re headed  It’s really not that far away.” To my English ears, it also suggests a finger angrily pointed at people who averted their eyes from Northern Ireland, and thereby committed the gravest Brexit folly of all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8f64e4ac4cfae80cae371c5306bf4f0fb172966/0_265_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d1bae690c31858b79d9cd7091e3c6c0","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of afternoon","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘afternoon’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘afternoon’.Share your photos of what afternoon means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 13 February at 10am.

There is a second spring of human action, he argues: the pursuit of excellence. A poet, a philosopher, or a sportsperson working obsessively may hope to be happy, but, more likely, what matters to them most is what they can achieve.Sidgwick’s work faded from fashion soon after his death in 1900. At Cambridge University, where he had been professor, he became a symbol of times past. The young Bertrand Russell and his fellows referred to him as Old Sidg. But his fortunes revived in the 1980s, and he is being read by undergraduates again. I don’t know if the current generation of university regulators ever studied him, but, if so, they have only remembered half of what he taught. We have the Research Excellence Framework, and the Teaching Excellence Framework. Where is the Research Happiness Framework, or the Teaching Happiness Framework?Still, if you wanted to be happy you might do better to keep clear of the higher education sector. For most academics and students the idea of making progress is about putting in the hard work and experiencing the frustration of getting most things wrong, most of the time. Almost everyone you talk to claims to have imposter syndrome, feeling that somehow they got their place or position as a result of clerical error. In the rare cases where they don’t, they probably ought to.It’s the pursuit of excellence, not happiness, that is built into every university mission statement. But what do we mean by excellence? The philosopher Harry Frankfurt begins a paper on equality with a joke. “First man: how are your children? Second man: compared to what?” And here, I think, he has put his finger on our problem.One kind of parent wants their children to reach their potential by developing their talents, forming strong relationships, achieving valuable goals, and having a satisfying life – excellence as flourishing. Another kind wants their children to come top of their class, and captain the team – excellence as winning. Universities talk the language of flourishing but a variety of league tables force us into competition. Our excellence is comparative.And what exactly is the point of pushing universities to compete with each other? To keep us sharp and on our toes, no doubt. To drive up quality, innovation, and variety of supply. But competition can have other effects, too. Karl Marx points out that the natural logic of competition is that someone wins. The Research Excellence Framework accelerates this process by rewarding the winners with the resources to do even better next time. This can leave others struggling to keep up, and, rather than innovating, they may try to ape the strategies that have been successful for those at the top. We see this in teaching, too, where university after university is shrinking the supply of lower-demand subjects, such as languages, and aiming to boost market share by copying successful programmes elsewhere, especially those that, for the moment, have the highest earning potential.Unlike free-market ideologues, economic regulators know that a competitive system is a delicate ecosystem, and to get its benefits loving care and attention are necessary. Otherwise, the relentless search for profits means every high street looks the same, with small, quirky shops driven out, and one retailer scooping up every online purchase. It is hard to set up a competitive system that rewards difference, and makes room for genuine innovation at all levels. In the HE sector at the moment it is hard to tell if we are even trying.Although Sidgwick believed that iniduals seek both happiness and excellence, eventually he reveals that he regards the pursuit of excellence as irrational unless it leads to a greater total of happiness in the world. Too bad he isn’t around to work out whether we have this right in the HE sector today.• Jonathan Wolff is professor of social policy at the Blavatnik School of Government, Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d6459a1040bdec97e00ea3d1eceded4a4deb398/0_616_5331_3199/master/5331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10ec71da143bf9461c97ca4acef62ed1","title":"biggest offshore windfarm to start uk supply this week","story":"High hopes for Hornsea One as developer says its output could fill the gap left by nuclearAn offshore windfarm on the Yorkshire coast that will dwarf the world’s largest when completed is to supply its first power to the UK electricity grid this week.The Danish developer Ørsted, which will be installing the first of 174 turbines at Hornsea One, said it was ready to step up its plans and fill the gap left by failed nuclear power schemes.What obstacles has wind power faced?The first subsidies awarded to offshore windfarms promised developers a guaranteed price of up to £150 per megawatt hour, or roughly three times the wholesale cost of electricity. Such steep subsidies would not be sustainable but cost reductions in the industry have seen that figure drop to as low as £57.50. The offshore wind industry has previously been criticised for not using enough UK contractors and suppliers.What is the economic benefit to the UK?The industry employs around 11,000 people. One of the side effects of offshore wind’s growth has been an injection of money and jobs into coastal towns that in some cases have big pockets of economic deprivation. Ports have been upgraded and new maintenance facilities built, such as the one at Newhaven in East Sussex for the first windfarm in the English Channel. The different parts of turbines are made across the UK, from the Isle of Wight to Hull.What does the future hold for offshore wind power in the UK?The industry has a target of growing today’s 8GW capacity to 30GW by 2030, which, if achieved, would see offshore wind power supplying more than a third of the UK’s electricity. The government has put a £557m pot of funding aside for subsidies for renewables in the next few years, most of which is expected to be taken up by offshore windfarms. The industry is also hoping for export opportunities for UK firms, as new markets grow in the US and Asia.The size of the project takes the burgeoning offshore wind power sector to a new scale, on a par with conventional fossil fuel-fired power stations.Hornsea One will cover 407 sq km, five times the size of the nearby city of Hull. At 1.2GW of capacity it will power 1m homes, making it about twice as powerful as today’s biggest offshore windfarm once it is completed in the second half of this year.“The ability to generate clean electricity offshore at this scale is a globally significant milestone at a time when urgent action needs to be taken to tackle climate change,” said Matthew Wright, UK managing director of Ørsted, the world’s biggest offshore windfarm builder.The power station is only the first of four planned in the area, with a green light and subsidies already awarded to a second stage due for completion in the early 2020s.The first two phases will use 7MW turbines, which are taller than London’s Gherkin building.But the latter stages of the Hornsea development could use even more powerful, 10MW-plus turbines. Bigger turbines will capture more of the energy from the wind and should lower costs by reducing the number of foundations and amount of cabling firms need to put into the water.Henrik Poulsen, Ørsted’s chief executive, said he was in close dialogue with major manufacturers to use the new generation of turbines, some of which are expected to approach the height of the Shard in London, the tallest building in the EU.Offshore windfarms could help ministers fill the low carbon power gap created by Hitachi and Toshiba scrapping nuclear plants, the executive suggested. “If nuclear should play less of a role than expected, I believe offshore wind can step up,” he said.The turbines for Hornsea One are built and shipped from Siemens Gamesa’s factory in Hull, part of a web of UK-based suppliers that has sprung up around the growing sector.Around half of the project’s transition pieces, the yellow part of the structure that connects the foundation to the tower, are made in Teeside. Many of the towers themselves are made by a firm in Campbeltown in the Scottish highlands. Altogether, about half of the components for the project are made in the UK.Ørsted is not yet ready to bid for a share of a £60m pot of further offshore windfarm subsidies, to be auctioned by the government this summer, but expects the price to reach even more competitive levels than those seen in 2017.Like other international energy companies, Ørsted has put in place contingency planning in event of a no-deal Brexit – but the hope is that will not come to pass. “We want a Brexit deal that will facilitate an orderly transition out of the union,” said Poulsen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c493b425463fec5789736194a7b53b2c65e2770/0_189_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ff022fdad925bbb37c5f52746f310f8","title":"nearly a fifth of eu budget goes on livestock farming greenpeace","story":"Europe urged to promote diets lower in meat and dairy and restrict animals to grass-based systems to free land for cropsNearly a fifth of the EU’s total budget – more than £24bn of taxpayer money – goes to support livestock farming across Europe, according to new research by Greenpeace.At a time when scientists are calling for significant reductions in meat consumption, the report’s authors say taxpayers’ money should be redirected away from grain-fed, industrial animal farming.Yet, Europeans eat more than twice as much meat as national dietary authorities recommend, as well as twice the global average.“Adopting diets lower in meat and dairy would not only tackle health problems but would also reduce the pressure on land, freeing up more space for nature,” said the Greenpeace EU agriculture policy director Marco Contiero.Researchers from Greenpeace used publicly available data from the European Commission and Eurostat to estimate farm subsidies and land tied to rearing livestock.Instead of the intensive model of grain-fed livestock, the campaigners argue that meat and dairy production should be restricted to grass-based systems, where the animals are reared outdoors and fed a largely grass-based diet. This would free up large amounts of land to growing crops directly for human consumption.“If Europe produced and consumed exclusively grass-fed livestock, we’d be a long way towards producing and consuming less and better meat and dairy in line with what science tells us is necessary to protect nature, the climate and our health,” said Contiero.However other groups argue that intensively reared livestock is less carbon intensive than grass-fed meat, because it uses less land.Greenpeace said that EU farm subsidies should be redirected towards incentivising more fruit and vegetable production.“In the long run it makes increasingly less sense to incentivise production that creates more costly impacts to society than economic benefits,” said Professor Tim Benton, the UK’s former “food security champion”.“Farmers are not the ‘bad guys’ in a simplistic story: they are trapped in a system that rewards producing more at the expense of wider social costs arising from environmental and health impacts,” he said.The Pasture-Fed Livestock Association said the research had clearly identified that environmental damage does not arise from livestock per se, but as a result of the way in which some animals are reared."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

As the woman behind the counter pushed the extremely small lump of cheese through the grater, sliced the dusty pink mortadella and scooped from a veined round of gorgonzola, there was chatter – about the uncollected rubbish reeking by the side of the market, a grandchild, but mostly about the gorgonzola itself, and how much the woman’s husband hated it as much as she adored it. We were four in line, one woman twitching with impatience, but that didn’t matter – there was a tub containing about 600g of gorgonzola to be sealed and a story to finish.There are many stories as to the origins of gorgonzola. Franco Angeli recounts the most likely in his thorough and serious book about Italian cheese, Il Grande Patrimonio. At some point in the sixth century, in a town called gorgonzola, an unnamed Lombardian innkeeper found some forgotten rounds of stracchino – a simple cheese traditionally made from the milk of cows after they return stracce (tired) from the high pastures of Valsassina. Forgotten, the rounds had developed musty coats and thin veins of mould within. The innkeeper declared his discovery delectable, and christened it erborinato, a term which probably comes from Lombardian dialect for parsley, for the green-blue marbling that ran through the newly born cheese.For quite some time, the discovery was simply called stracchino verde or stracchino di gorgonzola. It was only at the start of the last century that it became gorgonzola, and was granted the cheese equivalent of a knighthood – DOC or protected status – in 1955.The Milanese food writer Anna Del Conte describes the traditional process well, how gorgonzola is made from both the hot and cold curds of two milkings, how penicillium is added along with the rennet, and the curds pressed into 30cm rounds. Fine needles are then inserted into the rounds, and these holes encourage and help the mould spores to do their thing and grow green-blue-grey veins that marble through the cheese.Gorgonzola was famously aged in the grotte (caves) of Valsassina and Val Brembana, alpine valleys near Milan. Some small producers and farmers still work in this way, continuing to age gorgonzola in mysterious, dark caves, but mostly these conditions are recreated in factories.There are two sorts of gorgonzola. Gorgonzola piccante, as the name suggests, is feisty and piquant the prominent veins in this firmer, at times crumbly, cheese have a musty tang and bite – even a slightly metallic note. Dolce means sweet, and, although it is not actually sweet, gorgonzola dolce is certainly sweeter in nature, the veins lighter both in look and taste, and pleasantly tangy next to the creamy cheese.Salty-sweet blue cheese with its pointed tang craves bitter flavours, according to food writer Niki Segnit, author of The Flavour Thesaurus. She is right, which is why sage, with its inherent musty bitterness, works so well here – as do the optional toasted walnuts, milky but with their slight nicotine-like bitterness, also adding a rubble of texture to the rich sauce. This is a luxurious dishy dish, which – if both people in the couple love gorgonzola as much as they love each other – could be just the thing for February 14th (just don’t choke on a walnut).500g fresh or dried egg tagliatelle30g butter1 garlic clove, peeled and thinly sliced6-8 sage leaves75g gorgonzola, cubed100ml double creamSalt and black pepper1 handful shelled walnuts, roughly choppedBring a large pan of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook as per packet instructions.

Especially when you have people around you doing bad things.”More than a month away from celebrating his 19th birthday, the first player born this millennium to represent England and a trailblazer for his generation is holding court at Borussia Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion. Dressed in a turquoise green tracksuit and immaculate matching trainers, the unassuming Sancho does not come across as the most coveted teenager in world football as he makes a point of shaking hands with every journalist around the table with the greeting, “nice to meet you”. Clearly at ease in his surroundings in western Germany as he prepares for his return to London to face Tottenham in the Champions League on Wednesday, he is taller and broader in the shoulders than this time last year something the makers of the Fifa video game may want to take note of. “I am stronger than it says,” he says, laughing. The boy from the Guinness Trust Buildings estate who left home at 12 has now become a man.“For the kids that are in south London I hope I can give a positive message,” he adds, intently. “Don’t do those bad things. You don’t have to be footballers. You could focus on your school work. Education is the most important thing and a lot of kids in south London get distracted from education.”Had he not been blessed with a talent with the ball that convinced his headteacher at Crampton primary school he was destined to be a star when she first saw him as a five-year-old, Sancho knows his story could have turned out very differently. Eight goals – including the brilliant finish from a tight angle in Saturday’s 3-3 draw with Hoffenheim – and nine assists in the Bundesliga this season have allowed Lucien Favre’s vibrant young Dortmund side to dream of winning a first title since 2012. His bold decision to reject a new contract with Manchester City worth £30,000-a-week and move to Germany in search of first-team football is proving a masterstroke.Yet just like on the pitch, where his outstanding skill and dribbling speed have made him a social media sensation and earned comparisons with Neymar, Sancho has always been prepared to take risks. Having joined Watford aged seven, he would travel across London three nights a week to train and was later persuaded to leave his friends and family behind to join the club’s affiliated school, Harefield Academy in Uxbridge, west London.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels“I didn’t really want to go to that boarding school,” Sancho reflects nearly seven years on. “I wanted to stay at home and travel but the people around me told me what was best and I listened to them. I am happy that I am here today, where I am.”Now sharing an apartment with his father, Sean, a former security guard, near Dortmund’s impressive home, Sancho is in regular touch with his mother and friends back in Kennington and says he is enjoying life in “a chilled city”, even if he admits “learning German will be always kind of hard to me. But I’m getting the basics right,” he adds with enthusiasm, “working up on speaking German in training. I know what the manager is saying in training sessions, which makes it easier for me and for the players also: that’s how you interact, you come together more.“Me being so comfortable being abroad is due to the fact I’ve always been away from home. When I first left home it was very difficult, because I wasn’t used to it, I was always with my mum. The first couple of years were very tough and then as I got older people started to tell me: ‘It’s either this or going back home.’ And I always loved football, so I always chose the hard option. That’s what’s made me more comfortable being away from home than other people, so I’m kind of lucky.”Last month, Chelsea rejected a bid of £35m from Bayern Munich for Callum Hudson-Odoi that would have made him the most expensive British teenager. Germany’s most successful club remain confident of signing him in the summer and it is no exaggeration to say that Sancho’s impact at Dortmund since he was handed Ousmane Dembélé’s No 7 shirt in 2017 has been a major influence in their determination to sign his former England Under‑17 teammate.BVB’s sporting director, Michael Zorc, said it was during a youth international that they first became aware of Sancho’s extraordinary ability and subsequently made every effort to persuade him to leave City.But having come up against his childhood friend Reiss Nelson against Hoffenheim on Saturday – the 19-year-old is on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season – and with several other English teenagers starting to follow in Sancho’s slipstream as opportunities for young players in the Premier League continue to be scarce, he is quick to explain that the adaptation has taken time.“It hasn’t been easy. I’ve had to work for this. Everyone around me is keeping me grounded and keeping me focused. I’m improving every day and Marco Reus, Mario Götze and Axel Witsel are great role models to me and everyone else in the team. It’s really nice to have them around telling me what to do, and what’s not good, helping me solve things I wouldn’t solve by myself, so I’m happy.”Sancho won his first senior England cap against Croatia in October and was visited in Dortmund last week by Gareth Southgate’s assistant, Steve Holland. He is expected to be part of the squad that will face the Netherlands in June in the Nations League semi-final in Portugal but says being out of the spotlight in another country has allowed him to keep a distance from the developing hype surrounding him back home.“I’m not aware at all,” he says. “Obviously I’ve seen Twitter things, but I don’t know how … I don’t ask questions really, I just stay focused on what I’m doing and just keep going forward. All this media. This is all new to me. This is all crazy. I never knew you could be so known over your success. I thought if you are doing well everyone talks obviously, the fans, but I never knew they would take so much interest, but this helps a young player, the media training. It helps them out but this is the biggest thing. This is crazy.”It must be said that his innocence is rather endearing. Sancho also barely seems able to believe that he will be back in his home city to play against Tottenham in the first leg of their last-16 tie in Europe’s premier club competition. Thirty members of his family and close friends will be at Wembley to see whether Dortmund can gain revenge for losing home and away to Spurs in the group stages last season.“I feel like we have improved so it won’t be the same match as last year. It will be more difficult for them. Especially as they have some big players missing out so it is going to be a tough one,” Sancho says.“It’s a great feeling. I’ll be playing in front of my family, which is something I’ve always wanted to do since I was a young boy. Now I’m able to do it and hopefully I can show London people what I’m about. Everyone was messaging me saying: ‘I need a ticket!’ It’s big. I’m just happy that I’m playing in the Champions League. It is a big thing for me like it is for every player. That’s the biggest stage in the world so I’ve got to keep on working hard and hopefully I will get many more chances.”As well as his quick feet and mesmerising ball control, Sancho attributes his fearless attitude to the hours and hours of cage matches he played as a child on the estate in Kennington. He plans to return to Crampton and Harefield at the end of the season to answer questions from pupils and is clearly passionate about giving something back to the community that helped raise him.Eloquent, intelligent and with the world at his feet, Sancho is certainly a decent role model for any child of the 21st century."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b46073d2da57c7c43febe8476a07e7df4f95e8f/0_90_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee514c6819c036ef8c23cc6c6d27da97","title":"maurizio sarri month chelsea malmo europa league","story":"• Europa League takes on added significance for Blues• Chelsea have still to score an away goal in 2019Maurizio Sarri’s fate as Chelsea’s head coach will in effect be determined over the remainder of this month as the Italian seeks to convince the club’s hierarchy that he can recover some poise and still deliver Champions League qualification for next season.Sunday’s humiliating 6-0 thrashing at Manchester City, Chelsea’s worst defeat since 1991 and a loss which confirmed a drop from fourth to sixth place, has left Sarri clinging to his position only seven months into a three-year deal. The head coach will hope progress in the Europa League, starting with Thursday’s knockout tie at Malmö, earns him time, given the competition’s winners gain entry into next season’s Champions League.Yet eliminating the side who finished third in the Swedish league last season would only marginally bolster his job prospects unless a team clearly struggling to come to terms with his tactical demands can improve their performances over a daunting run of domestic fixtures.Chelsea face Manchester United in the fifth round of the FA Cup, Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final and Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League before the month is out, games in which the board will expect to see reasons for optimism. Any decision over Sarri’s future would still be taken by Roman Abramovich, despite the fact the owner has not attended a game this season and now spends the vast majority of his time in Russia and Israel.The director Marina Granovskaia remains his eyes and ears at the club and was instrumental in the appointment of the Italian last summer. Sarri’s post-match suggestion at the Etihad Stadium, delivered to his country’s media, that he “never hears” from Abramovich was apparently not considered as a slight against the owner.Yet there was risk attached when he appeared to echo his predecessor Antonio Conte’s regular complaints about a lack of contact with the real power at the club, even if it is understood that, should Sarri indicate he wishes to speak face to face with Abramovich, a meeting could be arranged. Whether the team’s cluttered schedule would grant the Italian the time to travel abroad and meet the Russian, however, is open to question.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsSarri, whose side have yet to score away from Stamford Bridge this calendar year having been soundly beaten at Arsenal and Bournemouth prior to the embarrassment at City, was back at the club’s Cobham training ground late morning on Mondayto oversee his players’ brief warm-down session before preparations began for the last-32 tie in Sweden.The squad split between the gym and work outside on the training pitch, with a small-sided game overseen by the head coach, with the mood described as “workmanlike” by one observer.The hierarchy will now demand a positive response. They have consistently put out experienced sides in the Europa League this season, albeit often using senior players otherwise on the fringes, and that is unlikely to change this week given the importance now heaped on progress in the competition. There remains the potential for the much maligned Jorginho to sit out that tie, with Mateo Kovacic having been employed in his midfield brief at times during recent games, but a full-strength squad is still expected to travel to Malmö.Frank Lampard, who has been mooted as a potential successor, not least in the wake of the success instigated by Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Manchester United in recent months, moved to distance himself from the position on Monday. “Chelsea are certainly a club I respect, and have a manager I respect,” said the Derby County manager. “My job is here and I’m working very hard. All my thoughts are on Ipswich Town away on Wednesday. I hope to see Chelsea put some form together and turn their results around.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88aa1a03519274b64aeac3f515569610b134231a/0_0_5040_3360/master/5040.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=40733a1ca9eb722a2b0eee1588b7bca6 960w","title":"everything you need to know to function as a successful adult","story":"One of the key benefits of age is wisdom.

It’s not their fault or ours, but you tend to lose touch with your childhood the older you get and it can become difficult to understand each other.What do you wish you’d known growing up?When you’re young you don’t have much confidence.

It also helps to be optimistic and positive.What simple skill do you think everyone should know?I find anything to do with plumbing really complicated, but I recently learned how to bleed a radiator. Instead of sitting in a cold room for years I could have done something about it – so that’s a good skill to have.And if you lived your adult life again, what would you do differently?Before I had a family I had a lot of disposable income, but I didn’t save any of it. I wish I’d put some aside for later life.What do you wish children understood about adults?What gives you authority as an adult is that you’re regarded as omniscient, but it would be nice if children appreciated that you haven’t got the answer to everything.What do you wish you’d known growing up?The importance of learning. I treated education as a passive thing and assumed that other people who were clever were just naturally gifted – I didn’t appreciate the fact that you could educate and improve yourself.What’s your golden tip for how to breeze through life?Smile, be helpful and think of others.

But host Pete Hegseth may now have managed to upset the famously germaphobic president – by revealing that he has not washed his hands in a decade.The admission came as Hegseth discussed eating day-old pizza that had not been refrigerated. He did not see any issue with eating the pizza, he said, then added that he didn’t think he had washed his hands in 10 years.“Really,” he said. “I don’t really wash my hands ever.”Met with laughter, he explained: “I inoculate myself. Germs are not a real thing. I can’t see them, therefore they’re not real.”On Twitter on Monday, Hegseth gave mixed messages. He claimed he had been joking and paraphrased the president in blaming the media for being so “self-righteous and angry”.

By  Olivier van BeemenThe first time Heineken amazed me was in Tunisia, in early 2011, when I was covering the Jasmine revolution and the fall of President Ben Ali for a Dutch business newspaper. During my reporting, I discovered that Heineken maintained close ties with the kleptocratic family clan that had ruled Tunisia for almost 25 years. It was not just the relationship itself that had me stunned – it was the fact that Heineken was brewing beer there at all. I knew the company was doing business all over the world, and I had some vague notion that it would have breweries outside the Netherlands, but I had never realised the scale: 165 breweries in more than 70 countries, including this north African autocracy.The following year, I decided to begin work on a book about Heineken’s operations in Africa. When I told people in the Netherlands about my plan, I was mostly regaled with positive stories. A woman who had done an internship at Heineken told me she chose to apply to the company because of its corporate social responsibility, and she waxed lyrical about “the combination of idealism and no-nonsense business”. I went through Dutch news archives and found enthusiastic stories about the company’s work in Africa, with headlines like “Heineken is Helping”.In total, I spent six years researching Heineken in Africa. On my first few reporting trips, I was suitably impressed. As a Dutchman, you inevitably feel a certain pride when you are far away from home and notice how popular “our” brands are. The company, which has operated in Africa since the 1930s, likes to present itself as a dynamic enterprise that has achieved remarkable success on a commercially challenging continent, where many countries struggle with bad infrastructure, low education levels, corruption and political instability.But I started having misgivings early on. In the company archives, I discovered that in the early 1960s Heineken was an ardent supporter of a “white bloc” of southern African countries, including Rhodesia, South Africa and the two Portuguese colonies Angola and Mozambique. I learned that in South Africa a senior manager urged his colleagues not to act “in opposition to the letterspirit of apartheid”, and I also read about the enormous amounts of money that Heineken channelled from Africa into a subsidiary in Switzerland, taking away an important source of fiscal revenue from the governments of newly formed independent states.While travelling around the continent, I heard about free crates of beer given to elites in Burundi, I saw little schools in Nigeria with beer logos painted on the walls, and I witnessed the misery of the drinking dens in the South African township of Soweto. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), I saw the worryingly cosy relationship between the brewery’s PR department and local journalists. These issues turned out not to be incidental, but formed part of a pattern.In time, I began to realise that Heineken’s references to the difficulties of operating in Africa, however real, form part of a narrative in which the company’s own achievements are enlarged and responsibility for its wrongdoing lies elsewhere. The message is that it is actually nothing short of a miracle that this beer brewer can operate under such difficult circumstances and, along the way, does so many good things for the people and planet.What is absent from the narrative is that some of the apparent difficulties Heineken faces in Africa can also be surprisingly useful. Consider, for example, weak governments that fail to maintain roads and healthcare, obliging the company to find costly solutions – clearly an obstacle for business, one would think. But at the same time, lawlessness in many countries enables Heineken to sell and advertise its drinks without the hassle of regulation. Levels of education are often low, which can be a hindrance when looking for qualified personnel – but also a blessing in disguise when there is information to be spread about the supposed “positive” properties of beer.“Don’t turn this into a crusade against Heineken. You’re too young for that,” Van Boxmeer warned me during our first meeting. I can reassure him. This is not an indictment of Heineken specifically, but a study of the ways one multinational in Africa operates. As far as I have been able to determine, the Dutch beer brewer’s behaviour resembles that of its competitors and other western companies in many respects. My aim is to provide an accurate image of a company that likes to blow its own trumpet regarding its supposed African success story – a story for which it has been lavishly praised, both inside the Netherlands and on the international stage, at the UN general assembly.In its code of conduct, Heineken describes its workers as “our greatest assets”. So what is working for Heineken in Africa really like? Not bad, at first sight. Across the continent, I have met former employees who look back with pride on their careers – no matter whether they were carrying crates or running the brewery. Most of Heineken’s staff members in Africa are on relatively low salaries by local standards, but Heineken compensates for this by being an attentive and encouraging employer.“As a simple operator, you don’t earn much,” says a former Rwandan manager whose first job was as a maintenance engineer. “But supervisors and higher staff are well paid, and when I started out there were many more managerial roles available, compared to other companies. If you do your work well, you get recognised and promoted.” For successful employees, there are also status-enhancing perks such as company cars or tablet devices. Employees also appreciate the wide range of training courses on offer.For most of Heineken’s staff in Africa, there is no pension scheme, but at the end of their careers they are often entitled to a good severance package. Some use the money to start their own company. I found former employees who had started a fish farm, a consultancy business and a bakery. Others had stayed faithful to their old line of work and opened a bar.One group of employees gets fussed over more than most: expats. Very often, the company maintains rent-free luxury villas on or near local Heineken premises, for expatriate staff. The number of African managers has risen across the continent as a whole, but in most countries white staff remain at the top of the pecking order. (At the time of writing, nine out of 13 African subsidiaries are headed by Europeans, and four by Africans.) According to Heineken’s 2014 annual report, entry-level employees at Nigerian Breweries got a little over $2,000 per year (£1,500), while the company spent the same amount every day on a Dutch director in Nigeria – not counting the bonuses.In its operations across Africa, Heineken uses subcontractors and zero-hour workers increasingly often. In many countries, the income of a day labourer or a temporary worker does not amount to the “decent standard of living” that the company says is its goal. A cleaner in DRC cannot survive on a monthly salary of $40-50, and even a security guard who makes three times as much will find it hard to make ends meet. Moreover, external workers have no rights to healthcare or other services. In theory, it is the agencies that hire them that must provide these, but failure to do so does not tend to stop Heineken from working with them.In Lubumbashi, a city in DRC, I met a temporary worker who told me he was not allowed to take a break. “When the directors leave for lunch, the staff just keep working,” he said. “We were supposed to get a canteen, but the budget for that has been cut. They don’t have the whip like they used to in colonial times, but the pressure of work is too much and bears no relation to our salaries.”He said he laughs out loud at the slogan of Fondation Bralima, Heineken’s local charity: “Committed to the wellbeing of the Congolese.” His conclusion: “Let them start with the wellbeing of their own workers.”If there is one group to whom the temp’s last words should apply, it is the “beer promotion girls”, young women who are hired to help boost sales in bars. In 2000, a group of aid organisations in Cambodia sounded the alarm about the risks promotion women faced in doing their job. They spoke of promotion women as being akin to “indirect sex workers” who earned very little and were often harassed, pressured into having sex with customers and ran the risk of contracting HIV.Heineken set up an internal working group to tackle the problem in Asia. “It was difficult because these girls were not directly employed by us and turnover was large,” recalls former HR manager Hans Wesseling.Katinka van Cranenburgh, a former Heineken executive, who took responsibility for the issue within HR, says it wasn’t until an important shareholder lodged a complaint that any significant action was taken. “Internally, we appealed to morality and the rights of women, but we saw that an angry letter from an investor yielded better results,” she says. Heineken issued a series of guidelines entitled Promotion Girls Policy: Selling Beer Safely. Henceforth, the young women would receive training, and the company promised to try to ensure better working conditions.As early as 2003, according to internal documents, Heineken became aware that similar problems were occurring in Africa. A spokesman at the time commented in a Dutch daily: “It’s nothing special. It’s like the girls you used to see walking on the streets in the Netherlands, giving away free magazines for a private broadcaster and wearing a dress with its logo.”Wesseling, who worked at Heineken from 1991 until 2005, says: “We had promotion girls in Africa. We knew this, in spite of internal denials. It was extra problematic because we had been running a very successful Aids policy in Africa.” From 2001, HIV-positive Heineken workers in Africa and their immediate families had been offered free therapy for life, which would continue after retirement or redundancy. Therapy always came with counselling, free condoms and HIV tests – and Heineken’s treatment of its workers won praise and admiration across the world, including among US politicians. “It gave our people in the US a great story,” said Wesseling. “So nobody was going to kill that image with African promotion girls having to sell our beer under the direst of circumstances. Better to frame that as a local custom: ‘That’s how they do things over there.’”In 2007, an internal inquiry showed that Heineken was using about 15,000 promotion women globally, mostly in non-western countries. No fewer than 70 markets were considered risky for the promotion women because the work involved or could lead to sexual abuse, low pay or being forced to wear provocative uniforms. Sixteen of those markets were in Africa: circumstances were least favourable there, and Heineken was said to use almost 2,000 promotion women. According to internal documentation, only one African market was problem-free.The person who Heineken chose to conduct this research was a 21-year-old intern, lending weight to the notion that the brewer did not consider this a subject of great importance. “I was a little taken aback that they asked me for such a delicate and important subject,” says the former intern, Diego Centurion.What did Bralima, the Congolese subsidiary of Heineken, get out of this in terms of extra sales? “I don’t think they were that valuable,” says a former director in DRC. “It was a mess. When this thing was going on in Cambodia, we also got rules, but they did not change a great deal. For a while, management hired taxis to get the girls home at night, but eventually they decided this was too expensive. Those girls were getting less than the minimum wage, and they were used by Bralima personnel. Very often these were girls with problems, very vulnerable. Given that we paid them so very little, they were virtually forced to go home with a man.”Stefaan van der Borght, Heineken’s former director for global health affairs, says that at one point Heineken tried promotion boys: “We wanted to take away the association with sex, but it didn’t work. Another problem was that we used subcontractors, for reasons of flexibility. Sometimes you needed a lot of girls, for parties, and at other times it was quiet. So you were burdening these subcontractors with the workload and the social obligations, while Heineken was held accountable.”Promotion women in DRC and Nigeria continue to work under the most dreadful conditions. “Every evening I am touched against my will. It doesn’t matter whether I work in an expensive cafe or a popular bar,” says Peace, a promotion girl in Lagos. Her colleague Sylvia adds: “We learn how to handle this. During the instruction, they tell us there will be annoying men. But you have to tolerate them because you are trying to increase sales and make the brand stronger.”“We learn that we should not respond aggressively or say ‘stop’. By walking away, you let them know that it’s not appreciated,” says Peace.But what if someone continues? Is there someone there, from the agency hiring the women, someone they can talk to? “Yes there is, sometimes, but often not,” she continues. “It is a public space, so there will be no rapes. That can only happen when the girls go with the customers. But that is a choice. Our employer thinks: if you don’t like being fondled, you must look for other work. I don’t even notice it any more. I anticipate it.”The women’s incomes differ from one agency to another, and on average, at the time of this research, they earn about $8 per day. In an expensive city like Lagos, this is not much, but it tallies with other forms of unskilled work.A lot of women take the risk of sleeping with the customers. Peace and Sylvia think that at least half of their colleagues are doing this. “These girls can’t support themselves and they are desperate. This is the way they earn much more money,” said Peace. And what do the employers think? Are they trying to prevent it?“No, definitely not,” says Sylvia. “They like it when you act like this because it helps sales.”Peace agrees: “They keep girls like that because they bring many customers.”In Lagos alone, hundreds or possibly thousands of promotion women are used to sell Heineken brands. The situation in Nigeria is not exceptional. According to a well-connected source, there are at least 100 women active in Kinshasa, captial of DRC, and an unknown number in other Congolese cities.“Of course these girls are harassed, they are filles à tout faire (girls you can do anything with). It’s part of the profession,” says one Kinshasa salesman who used to work with the women. He calls them “whores” before continuing: “Sometimes Bralima uses real prostitutes because they know how to seduce a customer, and that’s advantageous. But others are stricter and draw a line the customer must not cross. They have a difficult time because if you work in a bar you are considered a public girl. The brewery doesn’t care about them.”Even for other Heineken staff in Africa, being a woman is not always easy. According to a number of people I spoke to, across the continent, ambitious women sometimes have to get intimate with the HR manager – usually a local member of staff – to get a job or secure a promotion. Expats at management level know the rumours, but rarely consider it their priority to bring the issue to attention.Wesseling, the former HR manager, says: “We knew that during the 1990s, things were happening in Congo that were beyond the pale. We had a very powerful HR manager who maintained a selection procedure that would not be accepted here. Women had to provide sexual services to get a job.” Heineken’s current CEO, Van Boxmeer, was general manager of Bralima from 1993 to 1996. But according to Wesseling, “he did not act when he was general manager there”.Other insiders told stories of expat managers in Africa a handing out jobs to their girlfriends. The Rwandan girlfriend of a top manager in DRC became the fuel supplier for one of their breweries even though the previous one was cheaper and more reliable, according to those in the know. In Nigeria, an expat director gave secretarial jobs to two of his conquests, for which they were entirely unqualified, according to colleagues. And one national director allegedly asked for female staff he wanted for himself to first be sent to the medical department in order to have an Aids test.When my book on Heineken was published in the Netherlands last year, the Dutch parliament passed a motion calling on the current minister for development and foreign trade, Sigrid Kaag, to get tough on abuses within or by Dutch business abroad. The abuse of promotion women had direct consequences for the company. The Global Fund, supported by Bill Gates, suspended cooperation with Heineken because of the scandal, and the Dutch ASN Bank, following a third inquiry, removed Heineken from its sustainable investment fund and has halted all other financial involvement with the company until further notice.Heineken revised an earlier declaration in which it had claimed that the company employed just 200 promotion women in two countries in Africa. An internal inquiry now revealed an estimated 4,000 women in 13 countries. The company announced a series of measures: clear and unambiguous rules, training, dress codes, no alcohol on the job and transport home after work. These are, almost word-for-word, the same measures that were put in a policy paper in 2004, which remained an empty promise.But this time, Heineken said, things really would be different. So, in March 2018, the company made a firm promise that reassured some politicians and stakeholders. “If we can’t guarantee good working conditions for our promoters in certain markets by the end of June, we’ll stop employing them there.”In the summer of 2018, I went to Kenya to see for myself whether Heineken had kept its word this time. Was I even surprised? I met with six promotion women, who all told me the same stories: nothing had changed. They still had to accept sexual harassment as part of the job, their uniforms were so short it made them feel like prostitutes, and some of them were forced to sleep with their bosses. In an interview with a Dutch newspaper a few months later, Van Boxmeer called my reporting on the promotion women “exaggerated”, without specifying why. “We cannot be responsible if a customer treats a promoter inappropriately,” he said. “We can’t control everything.”Freddy Heineken, the company’s legendary CEO, who died in 2002, used to say: “People don’t drink beer. They drink marketing.” He understood that selling beer successfully is a matter of psychology. It’s about image and an emotion. For many years, Heineken’s image has remained largely untroubled by the reality of its operations in Africa. “I can tell you from the bottom of my heart that here at Heineken we want to improve things and want to contribute positively to the societies where we operate,” one member of staff at Heineken’s head office in Amsterdam told me. “We try to stick to all the rules, however difficult that may be. I am hurt that this is trivialised with remarks that suggest it is all just commerce and marketing to us. It is very difficult to be an island of perfection in a sea of misery, but please, do not doubt our sincerity.”Heineken as an “island of perfection”. And Africa, where Heineken has made billions in the past century? “A sea of misery.” But, of course, we should not doubt Heineken’s sincerity.Translated by Bram Posthumus.

They say basic religious freedoms are under threat.The argument over whether schools should teach children about LGBT issues arose in a Birmingham state school last month when 400 predominantly Muslim parents signed a petition calling for the topic to be dropped from the curriculum.In November a Christian parent threatened legal action against her child’s state primary school in south London, claiming it had forced pupils to take part in a “gay pride parade”.Last July the DfE said all state schools would teach children about relationships and health education, including LGBT issues, from September 2020.Its draft guidance to independent schools is non-statutory but Ofsted inspectors and the DfE will take it into account when assessing schools or taking action. The advice is expected to be formally issued later this year.Objections have been raised by independent schools with a conservative religious character and by parents citing religious freedom. The letter supporting the new guidance expresses concern that the DfE plans to water down its advice.Any dilution would pose “a significant safeguarding risk to LGBT young people, who are still subject to significant levels of homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying,” the letter says.“Challenging LGBT discrimination in school lessons and in everyday school life is fundamental to fostering equality at school and in wider society,” it says. “Being LGBT and having a religion are not mutually exclusive. LGBT people are members of all communities, across religions and non-religious worldviews.”Among the signatories are the Rev Jeffrey John, the dean of St Albans Laura Janner-Klausner, senior rabbi to Reform Judaism Fiyaz Mughal, director of Faith Matters Andrew Copson, chief executive of Humanists UK and Kevin Courtney and Mary Bousted, joint general secretaries of the National Education Union.Copson said: “There is widespread support for LGBT inclusion in schools and it is imperative that LGBT lessons in independent schools are not diluted out of fear that it could offend some religious groups.“Providing an inclusive education for all pupils, including LGBT students, so that they can learn and develop in freedom must be the priority for schools and we urge the department against the watering down of its draft proposals.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We want all children to grow up to become happy, healthy and safe, which is why we are making relationships education compulsory for all primary schools as well as relationships and sex education compulsory for all secondary schools.“The draft guidance is clear that teaching should look at healthy relationships and that all pupils learn about equality.

We must have our own, independent trade policy,” May’s spokesman said on Monday.May will stress her continued focus on the backstop, but the EU’s chief negotiator insisted on Monday there was no question of Brussels giving in to Downing Street’s demands.“We’re waiting for clarity and movement from the United Kingdom,” Barnier told reporters after talks in Luxembourg with the country’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel.At a dinner with Barnier in Brussels later on Monday, the UK’s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, had been expected to echo May’s calls for a time limit on the backstop, a unilateral exit mechanism or its replacement with an “alternative arrangement”.But Barnier suggested beforehand that he would offer Barclay little succour. “Tonight I will repeat the EU’s positions. I will listen to what the secretary of state has to tell us concerning the alternative arrangements which the UK would like,” Barnier said. “But it’s not more than a concept today. I will also evaluate the interest from the UK side for possible changes to the political declaration, which, let me remind you, fixes the outline quite precisely for the future separation.”Following the dinner, Barnier said there had been “constructive talks” but reiterated the EU’s refusal to renegotiate the Irish backstop. “It’s clear from our side that we’re not going to reopen the withdrawal agreement but we will continue our discussion in the coming days,” he said.The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.\u0026nbspThat committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no ergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026nbspBut it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\u0026nbspThe problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.\u0026nbspThe backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.\u0026nbspThe new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.\u0026nbspBut an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.\u0026nbspThe Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is\u0026nbsp a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspExtending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.\u0026nbspStaying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the\u0026nbspEuropean court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.\u0026nbspA spokesman for the UK government offered no indication of any progress, adding that the two sides had agreed to further talks and were still seeking to find “a way forward”.A commission official said the two sides had “discussed the urgent need to find a solution that both respects the EU’s guidelines, as well as one that is supported by a strong majority in the House of Commons. Further engagement is foreseen over the next week.”Barclay will travel to Strasbourg on Tuesday to set out the UK’s stance to MEPs, and the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, will take the same message to Paris. In Westminster, meanwhile, May is expected to confirm she will hold another Brexit vote in parliament on 27 February.Opponents of a no-deal Brexit inside her cabinet and on the Tory backbenches want to hear confirmation from the prime minister that any motion she tables then will be amendable. That would allow them to have another attempt at winning a majority for an amendment that could force the prime minister’s hand, if she has not brought a reworked version of her deal back to parliament for MPs’ approval before then.Yvette Cooper and Nick Boles, two senior backbenchers whose amendment against no deal failed to gain majority support last month, have not yet made a final decision about whether to table a reworked version or wait until 27 February, the  understands. But they have been working on a revised version of their bill to extend article 50, which would then have to be tabled by mid-March to have a chance of being passed before exit day.Their amendment would set a final mid-March deadline for May to win a majority for her deal, obliging the government to make time for the bill if she has not secured parliament’s support before then.May’s hopes of cobbling together a majority were boosted on Monday as Boris Johnson said he would be willing to accept a deal with a time-limited backstop. The former foreign secretary told a meeting in parliament: “I think it must be pretty obvious that if you are going to have a time limit to the backstop – and I think that would be very good – it has got to fall before the next election.”Some more hardline Brexiters have suggested the backstop must be removed altogether from the withdrawal agreement, but that looks highly unlikely to win favour in Brussels. Downing Street hopes that if May can win round Johnson, she can split the hard-Brexit European Research Group (ERG).Together with a group of Labour backbenchers encouraged by promises of fresh guarantees on workers’ rights and environmental standards, May hopes she can win over enough MPs to pass her deal.Labour will table its own amendment this week seeking to put what the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, calls a “hard stop”, on the government’s negotiating time by enforcing a deadline by which May must bring a deal back to the Commons.May’s insistence that she will not countenance joining a customs union was seized on by those MPs who want to see Labour embrace a “people’s vote”. They suggested it was now time for Corbyn to do so.It emerged on Monday that an earlier draft of Corbyn’s letter to the prime minister last week, which was initially drawn up by Starmer, included a reference to a referendum, but it was removed during the editing process.Asked about the claim by journalists in Dublin on Monday, Starmer said: “The letter was an agreed letter that went out. We’ve now got a response from the prime minister. The critical question is: is she, in her response, indicating a willingness to drop her red lines or not?”In her letter to Corbyn, May argued that her own Brexit plan “explicitly provides for the benefits of a customs union” in terms of avoiding tariffs, while allowing “development of the UK’s independent trade policy beyond our economic partnership with the EU”.She wrote: “I am not clear why you believe it would be preferable to seek a say in future EU trade deals rather than the ability to strike our own deals.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/062d16ab63661687bbf8ca1dbf747dc97bdd30f2/0_360_1937_1162/master/1937.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fd7d762c697c63848a2de39a7b3ab0e","title":"brexit leadsom urges tories not to be purist about irish backstop","story":"MPs should ‘hold their nerve’ and give May time to seek changes, says Commons leaderAndrea Leadsom has urged Conservative MPs not to be “purist” about the changes Theresa May hopes to secure for the Irish backstop arrangement, as she said the House of Commons must give the prime minister more time for negotiations.The comments are likely to spark concern among Tory Eurosceptics who have insisted the withdrawal agreement must be reopened and legally binding changes made to the backstop, though MPs differ over whether they would like it removed entirely and replaced or just given a time limit.May will give a statement to the Commons on Tuesday where she will hope to convince MPs to give her another fortnight’s grace to keep pushing for changes to the backstop – despite the insistence of the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, overnight that it is Britain that must compromise.Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said MPs should “hold their nerve” and give May time to seek the changes they required, a coded warning to some MPs who may have been seeking to amend the prime minister’s motion later this week to force a new timetable for a fresh vote on the Brexit deal.May had previously vowed to Eurosceptics after a vote passed in parliament mandating her to find “alternative arrangements” to the backstop that she understood that meant reopening the withdrawal agreement text – something the EU has insisted cannot be done.Leadsom sounded cooler about that prospect on Tuesday, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, and hinted that a codicil may be an alternative.“The point is to ensure that the UK cannot be held in a backstop permanently. How it’s achieved is not something to be purist about,” she said.“I’m wedded to delivering on what parliament has said it would support and that is some kind of unilateral means or alternative arrangements for the UK not to be held in the backstop permanently.”Leadsom would not commit to a new vote on the Brexit deal being held by the end of February, or even before the next EU summit on 21 March, eight days before the UK is due to leave the EU.She said the meaningful vote would be brought back only when May had “met the terms of parliament’s instructions two weeks ago that the backstop needed to be time-limited”.May is expected to bring forward another amendable motion, similar to the motion tabled this week, on 27 February so MPs will have another opportunity for debate if no deal has been reached by then.“Her message today is going to be that parliamentarians should hold their nerve,” Leadsom said.“What the prime minister wants is a bit more time to undertake what are now pretty crucial but delicate negotiations with the EU. The work is under way and the prime minister needs a bit more time.”Yvette Cooper and Nick Boles, two senior backbenchers whose amendment against no deal failed to gain majority support last month, have not yet made a final decision about whether to table a reworked version or wait until 27 February, the  understands.But they have been working on a revised version of their bill to extend article 50, which would then have to be tabled by mid-March to have a chance of being passed before exit day.Their amendment would set a final mid-March deadline for May to win a majority for her deal, obliging the government to make time for the bill if she has not secured parliament’s support before then.Labour will table its own amendment this week seeking to put what the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, calls a “hard stop”, on the government’s negotiating time by enforcing a deadline by which May must bring a deal back to the Commons.At a dinner with the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, on Monday night, Barnier said he would listen to the UK’s plans for alternative to the backstop but insisted there was no chance of reopening the agreement.“I will listen to what the secretary of state has to tell us concerning the alternative arrangements which the UK would like,” Barnier said before the dinner. “But it’s not more than a concept today.”Responding to his comments, Leadsom said it was clear the compromise needed to be from Brussels.“It would be an extraordinary outcome if the thing the backstop is seeking to avoid – a hard border in Northern Ireland – if the EU were so determined to be completely intransigent about it that they actually incur the very thing they are seeking to avoid by pushing the UK into a situation where we leave without a deal at the end of March,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1d465f10ea186534254013243b55206c28b25d4/190_138_3171_1902/master/3171.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1c43d104e55447f19b7a4ba4a3281b2","title":"hammonds brexit dividend claim rejected as uk economy stalls","story":"Chancellor’s claim undermined as rapid slowdown in GDP growth is revealedPhilip Hammond’s claim that Britain can reap an economic idend from Theresa May’s Brexit deal has been flatly rejected by MPs, as official figures confirmed the UK has suffered its worst year for GDP growth since 2012.In a highly critical report, the Treasury select committee warned that the chancellor’s claims of a “deal idend” if Britain avoided a no-deal exit lacked credibility.Nicky Morgan MP, the Conservative chair of the committee, said Hammond’s “idend” claim, at the Conservative party conference last year, had already been undermined by the government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. The OBR had told the committee the idend was not an economic boost so much as “avoiding something really very bad” in the form of a no-deal departure.“The OBR already assumes an orderly Brexit, so there won’t be a ‘deal idend’ beyond the forecast just by avoiding no-deal. Business confidence may improve with increased certainty, but it’s not credible to describe this as a idend,” said Morgan.The OBR has made a smooth departure from the EU a key part of its forecasts, which prompted the Treasury committee to state there is no evidence of an economic boost from supporting the deal over and above those central estimates.Hammond has repeatedly suggested that, should parliament throw its weight behind Theresa May’s Brexit plan, it would generate a dual economic boost for the country by lifting the fog of uncertainty blocking businesses investment, while also allowing him to spend public funds held in reserve for a no-deal scenario. Reacting to Morgan’s comments, Treasury insiders dismissed the suggestion that Britain would not see a deal idend from MPs supporting the prime minister’s Brexit plan, as it would give firms more clarity about the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU.“The chancellor has been clear that when we agree a good deal we will harvest a deal idend. This is because businesses will have the certainty they need to invest, grow and create jobs which will improve the public finances,” the source said.Most economists believe that Britain agreeing a Brexit deal with Brussels would help to give firms clarity for the future, potentially unleashing projects that have been put on hold due to the uncertainty.Amit Kara, the head of UK macroeconomics research at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: “It could be a idend as all we’re saying is we’re moving from an acute phase of uncertainty to remaining within the EU for at least the next two years.”He added: “The idend is just because of the mess at the moment.”The committee’s intervention undermines one of Theresa May’s key arguments to persuade MPs to back her withdrawal agreement with less than 50 days to go before Brexit. It also comes as the British economy shows increasing signs of stress as the deadline for the article 50 process looms ever closer, causing more business to put their plans to invest in Britain on hold.Companies have intensified their contingency planning to cope with the possibility of a disruptive Brexit. Car manufacturers are stockpiling parts, banks have moved employees to Ireland and continental Europe and two Japanese electronics firms, Panasonic and Sony, have moved their EU headquarters to mainland Europe.Labour and trade unions called on the prime minister to remove no-deal Brexit as an option in order to shore up confidence in Britain, something which May has so far refused to do in negotiations with Brussels.Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “The prime minister’s failure to rule out a no-deal Brexit is harming confidence in the economy and holding back growth. With our manufacturing sector in recession, the prime minister must act now to remove the threat of crashing out.”GDP growth in December plunged into reverse, with a broad-based slump across each of the key sectors for the economy. The manufacturing sector, which makes up about a tenth of the economy, fell into recession, with six months of negative growth in the longest negative run since September 2008 to February 2009, the depths of the financial crisis.While the slowdown mirrors a loss of momentum in the world economy, including a deterioration in the eurozone, most analysts believe that unique challenges from Brexit have further hindered UK growth.Ben Brettell, a senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “There’s little doubt Brexit uncertainty is responsible for the disappointing numbers, though concerns over global trade will also have played a part.”The committee also warned that Hammond’s deficit reduction target – to eliminate the gap between government spending and income by the early part of the next decade – now lacked credibility. Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal is expected to come with significant negative consequences for the public finances, with potential for the deficit to widen.Hammond opted at the last budget to raise public spending, with a £20bn a year increase for the NHS by 2023-24, without making significant tax increases to balance the books.Referring to that decision, the committee said: “The government’s fiscal objective has no credibility and should be replaced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dffbab36a739cb8b4e0f70f79d12ae15788a644a/2_0_7107_4267/master/7107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82b74f126dd1076a801fdb044779eaa1","title":"un big mess how rest of europe views brexit","story":"Seven correspondents report on how the UK’s political upheaval has affected its image on the continentThe comment slipped out after a long, geeky conversation about Brexit’s potential impact on Ireland’s trade, employment, banking and consumer confidence. “You know, we’d almost forgotten how good it felt to stick it to the Brits.” The speaker shrugged and grinned. “Old habits.”This was not a grizzled Sinn Féin party activist in west Belfast, but a young business professional in a cafe near the Dublin headquarters of Facebook and Google – the heart of new, globalised Ireland. Yet here was an admission – a declaration – of schadenfreude echoing down from a centuries-old resentment at the colonial master who came and stayed for 800 years.I hear it from officials, shopkeepers, academics, truckers, artists and students: the Irish government is right to insist on the backstop, and if that gives Britain’s ruling class an aneurysm, well, grab some popcorn and enjoy the spectacle.A tendency to enjoy the neighbour’s discomfort had faded in recent decades. John Major and Tony Blair earned respect for the Good Friday agreement. The Irish economy took off. There was a sense of a fresh start in Anglo-Irish relations.In the centenary year of Ireland’s war of independence, Brexit seems to have turned the clock back.But it hasn’t, not really. There is some relish at Westminster’s convulsions – the parliament of Oliver Cromwell reduced to Benny Hill. But the overwhelming emotion is worry that Britain will crash out of the EU without a deal, wreaking havoc on Ireland’s economy and destabilising Northern Ireland.And there is also sadness. A once-valued diplomatic partner, a neighbour with whom Ireland shares myriad cultural commonalities, is turning away. Glee at Westminster dysfunction is, it seems, an attempt to extract solace from a sense that Britain doesn’t care about breaking Irish hearts.“Brexit has damaged so many ways of doing business,” says Eunan O’Halpin, a history professor at Trinity College Dublin. “There is a sense that with the British unless it’s written down, you can’t trust anything they say.” Rory Carroll“It’s a mixture of bemusement and bewilderment,” says Michiel van Hulten, a former MEP. “On one level it’s entertaining, great spectacle. A pantomime you can’t stop watching. As you know, we love British comedy. Except this isn’t Monty Python, it’s your politicians.”In June 1667, Samuel Pepys recorded an MP spluttering “I think the Devil shits Dutchmen,” after the Dutch fleet sailed merrily up the Medway and trashed the pride of the Royal Navy. Anglo-Dutch relations have come a long way since then. Politically, minds met in the EU: pragmatic, and distrusting of a Franco-German stitch-up. In business, dual-nationals Shell and Unilever flourished more than 80,000 Dutch companies now trade with the UK.And the people? The Dutch master English like none other admire and consume British culture in quantity adore British humour. The Brits were people the Dutch could relate to. Then came Brexit.It’s bewildering, says Van Hulten. “We had such a close relationship. For a whole postwar generation, the UK was a shining example. People just cannot fathom that a country that played such a vital role internationally, and in Europe, cannot even manage its own affairs.”Thijs van den Berg, an Amsterdam English teacher, says he feels rejected. “As with any ex-lover, you now dislike what used to attract you. We liked your eccentricity because we knew at heart you were serious. Now you don’t look serious at all. Those jokes, that posturing – it just looks silly. Irresponsible.”But mainly, a country they once felt they knew has become a mystery. When parliament sent Theresa May back to Brussels to renegotiate, the Dutch paper Trouw described it thus: “It’s a bit like the crew of the Titanic deciding, by majority vote, that the iceberg really must get out of the way.” Jon HenleySpain may be preoccupied with domestic issues – the landmark trial of Catalan independence leaders and the sudden eruption of the far-right, to name only two – but the Brexit pantomime continues to fascinate, confuse and appal.Spaniards, who have long viewed British politics as an ancient beacon of democracy and informed debate, are struggling to reconcile their ideal with the realities of recent days, weeks and months.“We’ve always had a bit of a complex – always thought our democracy was more imperfect because it was younger than that of France, the UK or Germany,” says Marta García Aller, a journalist with the online newspaper El Independiente.But the UK political class’s uncanny ability to ensure that Brexit somehow manages to play out as both tragedy and farce has marked a before and an after.“I think most people see it as chaos – and that’s very strange in a country whose people have such a strong reputation for being disciplined and well-organised,” says García Aller.There is, however, little schadenfreude. Spain is devoutly pro-EU and all too aware of how much is at stake. Perhaps that’s why the word that comes up most frequently in relation to Brexit is incertidumbre, or uncertainty.“People are starting to realise that this is all really happening, and worrying about what it will mean for the Spanish economy,” says García Aller.“What’s going to happen with the British tourists who are fundamental to the economy? To the retired Britons who live here? The thousands of Spaniards who work in the UK? We’ve all got a friend or know someone who’s a nurse in a British hospital or a teacher in a British university.”Ignacio Molina, a senior analyst at the Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid, agrees Brexit has disfigured the image of British politics as “moderate, pragmatic and dependable”. In the bungled departure preparations, he sees echoes of the UK’s post-imperial wane.According to Molina, the “systemic failure” of Brexit has called into question the very idea of “the great British democracy. It’s a project that hasn’t been thought through. Even with Trump, there’s a strategy. But with Brexit there’s no strategy and no plan. It’s the most un-British thing there is!” Sam JonesAs Brexit turns into what one French commentator called a “national psychodrama” – or, in the more prosaic words of a friend, “un big mess” – many French are addressing Britons with the sympathy normally reserved for the bereaved. “So sorry,” they say, as a no-deal B-Day looms. “What will you do now?”There is little gloating, much genuine concern, and massive incomprehension. The journalist Pierre Haski sums up Brexit bafflement: “Did electors really vote Brexit to allow the haughty aristocrat Jacob Rees-Mogg or the demagogue Boris Johnson to challenge Theresa May … or for Jeremy Corbyn to get into Downing Street without saying what he will do about Brexit?” It was a genuine question.The Channel tunnel has been key to softening historically fraught Anglo-French relations personal and cultural links have grown richer now that travelling between Paris and London is less traumatic than the average commute.As for the infamous “love-hate” relationship, of late the loathing has been largely one way. Screaming British tabloid headlines accuse France of deliberately orchestrating no-deal mayhem, while in the real world the French government is doing precisely the opposite.Thankfully, the abuse is shrugged off. If there is a response, it is frustration. “We’ve spent hundreds of hours on Brexit – and we do have other things to do,” one French civil servant tells me.Some try to make sense of the Westminster spectacle. Jean-Marc Puissesseau, the president of the company that runs the Calais port – also working hard to avoid Brexit chaos – says there were signs of Brexit years ago. “You had special conditions. You continued to drive on the left, you kept the pound … perhaps Great Britain is so fundamentally insular and protective of its own future and freedom, this is its destiny. But it’s a pity.”Hélène Orain, the director of Paris’s Museum of Immigration, hopes “the links between our countries will not stop, and we can continue to recount our common history”.If there is any silver lining to the present impenetrable Brexit cloud, it may be a growing feeling, for many Britons in France, that behind all the “frog” and “rosbif” nonsense, the French are really quite fond of us. Kim WillsherSigns of Anglophilia are easy to spot in Prague: a square named after Winston Churchill, a bunch of English-language bookshops and several branches of Marks \u0026amp Spencer. Since the Velvet revolution that heralded the end of communism in 1989, most Czech politicians, diplomats and opinion-formers have routinely deferred to Britain as a cradle of democracy and common sense. All this has added to Czechs’ bewilderment at the seemingly chaotic drama unfolding at Westminster as the UK staggers towards the EU departure gate.Jiří Pehe, a political analyst and director at New York University in Prague, recently summed up the mood when he tweeted that politics in Britain had become even worse than its Czech counterpart. “The infantilisation of politics, to say ‘if it’s not my way, it won’t be any other way’, reminds me of Czech politics,” he explains. “We ascribe it to the fact that Czech democracy is so young, and recovering from communism. To see an established democracy like Britain descending into this chaos and irrationality is really disheartening. It’s a very comprehensive defeat for British politics.”Some Czech policymakers worry that Britain’s impending departure from the EU will undermine the Nato alliance. Yet growing awareness of the political paralysis wrought by Brexit may have had one unexpected spin-off – a rise in support for EU membership here, where recorded levels of Euroscepticism have often matched, or even surpassed, those in Britain.In the days after the Brexit vote, Britons would remark that the Germans must be positively swimming in schadenfreude, after we had caused so much trouble in the EU. But among the people I spoke to – government spokespeople, supermarket cashiers, diplomats and taxi drivers – the overwhelming emotions were sadness and disappointment.A diplomat likens his melancholy to that of being dumped by a girlfriend. “I still have her jumper and I go round wearing it, hoping her scent will linger,” he says. He clings to the positive aspects of a Britain he cherished – from punk music to humour – and almost breaks into song: “They can’t take that away from me.”Germans are also resigned – if frustrated - by British misperceptions, from Boris Johnson’s claims that a “German-led” EU is pursuing a Hitlerian superstate to the notion that Berlin would force the EU to submit to the UK’s Brexit demands in order to save the German car industry. They are also immune to the British tabloids’ assertions that Germany is morally indebted to Britain for the defeat of Hitler, and so should throw Theresa May a lifeline.It’s a sign of the affection many Germans harbour for the UK that such feelings have not been dented. Even in their Brexit bewilderment, Germans still love holidaying in the UK, savour our lively parliamentary debate and obsess over the royals. But increasingly, they are coping with Brexit by separating Britain into two entities: cultural and political. Many kick themselves that they did not see it coming some ask what what they can do to help reverse it.But not everyone. A professor of risk assessment tells me the path to Brexit was long clear in Britain’s difficult relationship with the EU. “I think it is time Britain left now,” he says. “It doesn’t help anyone, least of all the British, for them to stay in.”I am one of thousands of Britons living here to have taken German citizenship since the referendum. My book on the process, Exit Brexit, has had an overwhelming response. That a Brit is prepared to embrace historically tarred Germany, in the way lots of Germans have embraced Britain, astonishes many.“If Brexit doesn’t happen, will you keep your German passport?” one interviewer asked. I assured her I have no intention of giving it up. Kate ConnollyPoland’s attitude towards Britain might be characterised as largely affectionate – but with an edge. Brexit is not helping.The wartime alliance is remembered in Poland as much in terms of British betrayals as of Polish pilots and the Enigma machine.Resentment eased during the cold war thanks to Britain’s role as a key adversary of communist Poland’s Soviet overlords, and the emergence – incongruously, for many – of Margaret Thatcher as a heroine of the Polish proletariat.At first, the large-scale migration of Poles– admired for their work ethic and almost universally accepted – to the UK in the 2000s appeared to herald a golden age in relations between the two nations. Many Britons assume the new arrivals were motivated exclusively by money, but many were also attracted by modern British multiculturalism. “I loved the freedom. I remember thinking: ‘This is it! This is my place on earth,’” a Polish woman who moved to the UK in 1999 tells me.That love of Britain has only intensified the pain of rejection after the Brexit vote. Complicating matters further, it is increasingly apparent that many other Poles living in the UK never accepted Britain’s multicultural model in the first place. Feeling rejected and economically exploited, the Polish community is increasingly a recruiting ground for the far right in both countries.There are of course many Poles who still live perfectly happily in the UK, and will continue to do so.

She added: “But they are telling me that universal credit is making their situation worse, not better.”Rudd, the former home secretary who has pledged a more humane approach to the benefits system since taking the work and pensions job in November, said: “I believe and hope that the changes we have made in terms of accessing early funds will have reduced insecurity, but of course I will take an early interest in the report that she is producing.”Universal credit has faced persistent criticism that its complexity and, in particular, delays to initial payments, have caused many people making new claims or moving from other benefits to go into debt, with some needing to use food banks.When he was a junior work and pensions minister, Damian Hinds, now the education secretary, said he did not expect the further rollout of universal credit to mean more people having to use food banks.In October, another junior minister in the department, Alok Sharma, rejected the findings of a report that said the shift to universal credit had caused many more people to use food banks, saying there were “very many reasons” why people used them.Ministers have sought to address the hardship caused by delays to initial payments by changing time limits and making it easier for claimants to receive an immediate sum as a loan.Since taking over at the department, Rudd has paused the planned mass “migration” of existing benefit claimants to universal credit pending another trial and introduced changes such as making payments directly to women if they are the household’s main carer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74ddfd9be2430cb98c888d3c9136808f63537685/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b065a186b66e188641b2f452cf49ba37","title":"brexit talking public spending local government audit","story":"Only a radical overhaul of auditing will ensure spending on benefits, health, care and infrastructure is fairThere are few upsides to Brexit, but one rare positive has been a heightened awareness about unfairness, especially between different places around the UK.A recent Centre for Cities report showed just how much northern cities, in particular, have been clobbered by austerity. The Key Cities group of 24 councils in England and Wales has joined the special interest group of mainly Labour and northern metropolitan authorities led by Barnsley’s Steve Houghton in calling for a fairer grants regime and economic rebalancing. Together the two groups represent urban areas where a quarter of the English population live. They have already made strenuous representations against the unfairness of this year’s funding settlement for local government, pointing out that “the most deprived areas have been forced to cut up to 10 times deeper than the most affluent”.The groups’ demands, as well as the Commons public accounts committee’s report on the unsustainability of local government finance, highlight what’s missing in how the government accounts for public spending. While auditors are despatched to sniff out economy, efficiency and effectiveness, they miss the vital element: equity.This spring should see a government spending review, to set the shape of public services into the 2020s. Butthis looks like becoming another casualty of Brexit, with uncertainty around when the review will take place and what spending it will cover. How can you make a plan when the prime minister is making big spending commitments on the hoof and the economy and public revenues face meltdown?But on past form, a Treasury-led spending review would, in any case, be deeply flawed. The Treasury is very good at control. It tells departments what they get and delivers the totals. But it is bad at ensuring the money is well spent, that it secures outcomes and does what ministers claim. Universal credit, to take just one policy, is a gigantic blot on the Treasury’s recent record.Lord Kerslake, former head of the civil service and former chief executive of Sheffield city council, says the Treasury needs to be more strategic. He wants it to look at the whole picture, from decisions about tax and spending programmes through to people’s everyday encounters with employment and benefit services, schools, clinics, policing and care. Spending should include appraising how projects are managed, how much contractors will get and, critically, who will benefit and where the money will end up.In a report for the Smith Institute John Tizard and I make the case for a radical overhaul of how we account for spending, before and after it is committed, and argue that it is opponents of austerity and advocates of higher spending who should be most clamorous for a tougher audit. Ensuring spending on benefits, health, care and infrastructure is effective and changes people’s lives for the better is at the heart of politics. Yet there are huge gaps in the data and in our understanding of what public spending actually buys. Getting value for money has too often been left to bean counters, which explains why the critical issue of equity – ensuring public budgets are fairly distributed – has been ignored.Later this year, Gareth Davies takes over from Amyas Morse as head of the National Audit Office, making it a good time to reflect on the future of that esteemed outfit. Amid plummeting regard for Westminster and Whitehall, the NAO’s reputation for rigour and honesty has never been higher. Yet its mission is fuzzy and there are large gaps. The NAO does the technical audit of government departments, but audit in councils and the NHS is done by private firms and not properly regulated. In recent years, the NAO has expanded its value-for-money studies, but no one looks at outcomes and outputs in local authorities or NHS trusts in any detail. No one compares and contrasts how money is spent and audited in England against Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which have separate accounts offices.Maybe the NAO should be repurposed. It could take responsibility for and tighten standards in the technical audit of councils and NHS trusts as well as Whitehall. Its value-for-money work, which goes far beyond accountancy, should be assigned to a new Office of the 3Es – equity, efficiency and effectiveness – which would join up the work of the various inspectorates, such as the Care Quality Commission, with value-for-money analysis across the whole public sector.Public money will always be scarce and precious. We need to raise more of it in tax – look at the array of problems facing the UK whatever happens to Brexit. The likelihood of voters agreeing to higher tax depends on persuading them that public bodies can manage and account for public money better and more fairly.*Spending fairly, spending well: time for a radical overhaul of value for money and public audit, published by the Smith Institute on 12 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bc2a1e70b9ade3ae49b6d9f1c2df04b49d1e932/0_3_3564_2138/master/3564.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1b073667a1624a90ab66f94476ba153","title":"hakeem al araibis family express indescribable joy at footballers release","story":"Wife of refugee thanks supporters for helping to secure his release as family call on Bahrain to ‘drop all the fabricated charges’Hakeem al-Araibi arrived in Melbourne on Tuesday, 77 days after he was arrested in Thailand on an Interpol red notice, drawing global condemnation and a campaign to see him freed.The 25-year-old refugee walked through the gates to cheers and a waiting group of supporters wearing T-shirts emblazoned with his name, as well as a throng of media, friends and supporters.Al-Araibi, a Bahraini refugee who has lived in Australia for five years, was released from a Thai prison on Monday after 76 days of incarceration. The shock decision by the Thai government and courts to free him brought to an end Bahrain’s attempts to have the dissident and athlete returned to them.Al-Araibi was swamped by his friends and team-mates before making a short statement.“It’s amazing to see all of the people here and all of the Australian people and all of the media who supported me,” said al-Araibi. “And I just wanted to thank the Australian government, the Australian people.”He stood next to former Socceroo Craig Foster, who spearheaded the campaign to free him.“I want to thank this man who fight so much for my case,” Al-Araibi said of Foster.“I thank the media, all the human rights. Thank you. I will be more strong for this country and I will be strong here for Australia. This is my country. I didn’t have citizenship yet, but my country is Australia. I love Australia.”The crowd erupted into cheers and shouts of “Welcome Home Hakeem”, and “It’s good to have you brother.”Foster said there was an “amazing coalition” of people around the world who worked to free Al-Araibi.He thanked prime minister Scott Morrison and foreign affairs minister Marise Payne, thanking Payne in particular for taking the issue personally and working “incredibly hard”.“Scott in recent times stepped up, particularly after so many athletes and Olympians asked him to take the issue personally, and he did so, and I thank him,” said Foster. “It made a significant difference.”Foster said they wouldn’t stop until people were held accountable for the past three months.“Nevertheless, above all else, this is about a young man getting back to his wife,” he said.Lou Tona, chairman of Al-Araibi’s Melbourne football club, Pascoe Vale, told the  he was overwhelmed, and he wanted Al-Araibi to know “Australia was right behind him”.Tona said Al-Araibi was a quiet kid and unassuming personality but a lion on the field.“When I walk in the change room I cop a lot of banter from all the boys. But he doesn’t give me any,” he said. “If he started now I’d forgive him for it.”The club’s first game is on Thursday. Team-mate Davey Van’t Schip said he couldn’t wait to see Al-Araibi.“I’m going to give him a hug,” Van’t Schip said.Tim O’Connor from Amnesty International told  Australia he was “feeling jubilant” and it was a day of celebration.“It’s so exciting to be here today to see Hakeem get off that plane,” O’Connor said. “He committed no crime – he was an innocent man caught up in a much bigger political game.”Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said: “Two moments captured the world’s attention this month. The photo of footballer Hakeem al-Araibi shackled and barefoot, and the moment of Hakeem breaking the chains and reunited with his beloved wife, friends and the football community in Melbourne.”His arrival in his home city came as family has thanked the international community for securing his release from potential extradition to Bahrain, a country he fled after he was imprisoned and tortured.In a statement provided to  Australia, Al-Araibi’s family said they were “heartened” to see pictures of his release, but urged the world not to turn away from those still unjustly detained in Bahrain.“We are heartened seeing our released son Hakeem Al-Araibi’s picture embracing freedom after more than two months,” his mother and siblings said.“Nonetheless, this indescribable joy would be greater when Hakeem’s detained acquaintances and compatriots are freed from Bahrain’s prisons of persecution.”Al-Araibi’s wife, who has not wanted to be identified throughout the ordeal, told  Australia she was thankful for everyone’s support. Before his departure from Thailand she said she wanted him to get on the plane before she could believe he was being released.Al-Araibi was arrested on 27 November on an erroneously issued Interpol red notice, which should never have been granted to Bahrain under clear Interpol policies designed to protect refugees from refoulement.While Thailand has said Bahrain withdrew its extradition request, allowing it to petition the court for Al-Araibi’s freedom, the Gulf state has maintained his guilt as well as its “right to pursue all necessary legal actions against Mr Al-Araibi”.Al-Araibi was sentenced to 10 years in jail in absentia for what has become a widely discredited vandalism conviction. The young footballer has said he was playing in a televised match around the time of the crime and could never have been there. He believes he was targeted amid a crackdown on athletes participating in pro-democracy protests.“As soon as our son reach (sic) Australia, we call upon the Bahraini authorities, which unlawfully treats Hakeem as a criminal despite his innocence, to drop all the fabricated charges, repeal the court’s unfair verdict, acquit and apologise for the physical and psychological repercussion it inflicted upon Hakeem,” his family said.Many dissidents remain imprisoned in Bahrain, where allegations and instances of mistreatment and torture have been repeatedly documented by human rights groups, and Al-Araibi’s family said they were “bitterly waiting for the world’s attention”.“Those are imprisoned merely in retaliation for their pro-democracy demands. Their parents as well aspire to reunite with them soon,” they said.“The outstanding fight for Hakeem’s case has averred that the continuous and effective efforts would find their way towards success.“We and Hakeem thank you again for your effort and free stance and ask you not to forget the oppressed people and prisoners of Bahrain.”The family thanked activists, media and human rights groups across the three nations involved and around the world who had “incredibly, and in all possible means, supported us and Hakeem to achieve this release”.“Our special thanks to the Australian football community and Hakeem’s colleagues particularly to the former Australia international footballer Craig Foster, who has honestly put nothing before this appalling case and has never lost any chance but to save Hakeem.“Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, O great warrior.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8dad12907e7ca2021b10a12e34db9dc63ce6ea/0_503_7466_4481/master/7466.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a73f7d1d14fae3d219d3fd27b5efed31","title":"north and south korea to launch joint bid to host 2032 summer olympics","story":"Seoul’s mayor calls Games a chance ‘to change the fate of the Korean peninsula’Seoul is hoping to “change the fate of the Korean peninsula” with the launch of a bid to jointly host the 2032 Olympic Games with North Korea.Representatives from both Koreas are expected to submit their plans to co-host the event at a meeting of the International Olympic City in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Friday. The South Korean Olympic Committee chose Seoul, a previous Olympic host, over the southern port city of Busan on Monday.The decision to involve North Korea in the bid reflects warmer diplomatic ties between the neighbours, a year after North Korea sent athletes, supporters and officials to the Winter Olympics in the South Korean alpine town of Pyeongchang.South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, who favours engagement with the regime in Pyongyang, has also suggested the two countries bid to co-host the 2030 World Cup. The countries also plan to send combined teams to the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.North Korea has yet to announce which city will join Seoul to bid for the 2032 Games, but experts say Pyongyang would be the obvious choice given its relatively advanced infrastructure.Officials described a jointly-hosted Olympics as an unprecedented opportunity for sports diplomacy to bring stability to the Korean peninsula.“Seoul will cooperate with the national government so that the 2032 summer Olympics become something more than a sports festival – an opportunity to change the fate of the Korean peninsula,” Seoul’s mayor, Park Won-soon, said in a statement.The feasibility of an inter-Korean Olympics would depend on the fate of North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes – the subject of talks in Hanoi at the end of the month between the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and Donald Trump.Sanctions that would make cross-border cooperation on Olympic infrastructure practically impossible are expected to remain in place until Pyongyang demonstrates a willingness to dismantle its nuclear programme.Nevertheless, serious discussion of a North Korean role in hosting the Games would have been unthinkable just two years ago, when the regime invited widespread condemnation after a volley of missile launches and its sixth nuclear test.North Korea boycotted the 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 summer Olympics, which were both held in Seoul. Bilateral ties deteriorated dramatically ahead of the Seoul Games, after the North bombed a South Korean airliner in November 1987, killing all 115 people on board."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d70bcfd3d6bedc8e8ce97270c43fb18fa821088/0_147_5450_3270/master/5450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8f8e84c97ac7af0faf6f86e28d5cd50","title":"westminster kennel club dog show new york 2019","story":"More than 600 dogs take up residence in New York’s Hotel Pennsylvania before the Westminster Dog Show. Jerry Grymek is there to accommodate every needIt’s the weekend before this year’s Westminster Kennel Club dog show and the basement of the Hotel Pennsylvania is a bustle of canine activity.An Australian shepherd and bichon frise trot away on side-by-side treadmills. A giant schnauzer is meticulously primped and primed on a grooming table while a half-submerged Newfoundland is scrubbed in an elevated bathtub. A half-dozen dogs mill about a sprawling purpose-built relief station covered with pine shavings and plastic fire hydrants.Jennifer Remazki, a breeder from Honey Harbor, Ontario, can’t help but smile as she takes in the scene with Shelby, her eight-year-old Alaskan malamute who’s come out of retirement for “one last go-round” at the Super Bowl of dog-lovers. It’s Remazki’s sixth time staying at the hotel, which sits across the street from Madison Square Garden, where the title of America’s top dog will be awarded this week.“I get a kick out of the facilities,” she says. “It’s so quirky. This is the part of the show I love to tell my friends and family about back home, because they can’t even conceptualize this. There is a room devoted to peeing and pooing. There’s been years there have been psychics here for the dogs. I find it very humorous.”Thousands of dogs and their owners have descended on New York to compete in the oldest continuously held sporting event in the United States after the Kentucky Derby. Predictably, many of the posh Manhattan hotels vying for a piece of the dog show market have temporarily relaxed their restrictions on pets.But none are more welcoming to the Westminster crowd than the Hotel Pennsylvania, where doggy concierge Jerry Grymek will cater and pamper to the more than 600 dogs – and their often particular owners – who will call the hotel home for the duration of the show.The 100-year-old landmark on Seventh Avenue is pet-friendly year-round, but becomes a veritable hotel for dogs each February when Westminster rolls around. The highlight is the basement conference room that is transformed into a canine salon and spa, but an assortment of other dog-related events on site throughout the week have elevated the hotel’s reputation among the tight-knit show community.“Every year we do this, we change something,” says Grymek, who works in public relations for the 1,700-room hotel during the rest of the year. “We’ve had a dog tourist corner. We’ve had a pet masseuse, an on-site veterinarian and a dog psychic who would communicate between the dog and owner. But it evolves over the years. Owners say I want to work on my own dog and some things fall out of favor. So we take the feedback and keep it to what they want and we plan for next year.”Grymek, who has worked in the role for 14 years, takes heart in seeing the same guests return year after year – and over time their children as they’re groomed into the sport as breeders or handlers themselves. The dogs are typically on their best behavior, he says. It’s the owners, many of whom travel great distances by car, who can be temperamental.“Some of the owners can be a little stressed out, especially when they’re lacking sleep,” he says. “But that’s why we try to do as much as we can here in this facility. Don’t worry, it’s all down here, you don’t have to go outside if it’s cold. People come down here in their PJs, do their business with the dogs and just go.”Grymek’s remit includes fetching comfort food for his canine guests on demand. The most popular orders include cheeseburgers, french fries and chicken sandwiches. Among the more unusual: spinach pizza. (“Nothing with onions,” he warns. “They’re bad for the dogs.”)The job can also mean accommodating the rituals and superstitions of owners. Guests will frequently ask to request a room where a former winner stayed, such as Uno, the popular beagle who captured the top prize in 2008. Or if best in show is awarded on 12 February – as it will this year – then an owner will invariably call to reserve room number 212. No ask, it seems, is too eccentric.“One owner wanted a green carpet rolled out for their dog,” Grymek recalls. “Another wanted to bring in an opera singer to serenade her Italian Spinoni.”Both requests, he says, were accommodated.“You can get anything and everything in New York,” he says with a laugh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fda7806872e5f66a153bc1b1566e01b3d08ffe5/0_146_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6326d93d70219082366714d290b91c5a","title":"world no 1 naomi osaka splits with coach two weeks after australian open win","story":"Naomi Osaka has split from coach Sascha Bajin, a little more than two weeks after she won the Australian Open to secure a second consecutive grand slam title and moved to No 1 in the WTA rankings.“Hey everyone, I will no longer be working together with Sascha,” Osaka posted on Twitter. “I thank him for his work and wish him all the best in the future.”Bajin, the WTA’s coach of the year in 2018, responded to thank the Japanese player. “I wish you nothing but the best as well,” he wrote. “What a ride that was.

England have been extremely well coached in both matches so far and so George North’s first try for Wales against France on the opening night will not have gone unnoticed by Eddie Jones and his assistants. They will have seen that Hadleigh Parkes’s kick forward found space, it put Yoann Huget in a position he did not want to be in and then a bit of pressure from North brought the mistake. England took that and seized on it.To be brutally honest, Sunday was as bad as the French can play – there was no structure and very limited awareness of what they were trying to do but again England stuck to their game plan and took their opportunities. France’s biggest problem was having Morgan Parra and Louis Picamoles stuck in the back field. Parra is a world-class player but England targeted him and France just could not react.A lot of teams leave their No 9 in the back field – Saracens are one example – and often if he is kicking from the back of a ruck or maul, the 9 will stay after the kick chase and the No 8 will often stay if the maul has gone to ground or he is the last man up from an exit ruck. But these guys have got to be practising fielding high balls and Parra and Picamoles looked completely exposed.Huget dropped the first one in the first minute but one would have expected to see him back there fielding most of the kicks. From that first minute onwards one knew what was coming – Owen Farrell, Elliot Daly and Henry Slade kept on poking the ball in behind, trying to keep it in play but it really was not a problem if it went out because the France lineout was malfunctioning as well. If your lineout is not going well and you are not dealing with kicks in the back fieldWith that combination, there is no relief from pressure and you are in for a long day at the office.England spotted it and took advantage but I am sure it was part of the plan coming into the match. It strikes me their open-field kicking percentage has gone up significantly in the last two matches – 47 open-field kicks is a lot – and what I am seeing is a lot of kicks on kicks. If Ben Youngs is sending up a box-kick and England are winning it back they are identifying quickly the picture of who is in the back field – a lot of the time against France it was no one – and finding the space. Youngs kicks again immediately. A lot of teams sometimes fall into the trap of box-kicking, getting the ball back and trying to play but it is a very good time to kick again. The defence is not set, they are anticipating getting the ball so get into an attacking shape and all of a sudden no one is reacting.Youngs did that brilliantly, Farrell as well, and England are benefiting from having two very capable left-footed kickers behind him in Slade and Daly. As soon as Farrell makes the pass England have moved the point of attack. That five- or 10-metre pass means the defending team has to get up because England’s wings come into play. England’s ability to put another pass in and kick from the edge then brings the defensive full-back up and if the opposing wings switch off it creates space in the back field.The questions now are how do Wales counter that and will England change their game plan in Cardiff? Firstly, Wales have to disrupt England’s rhythm. They must pressure England’s kickers and make sure Youngs is at the bottom of a ruck so he is not able to kick. If Wales kick to England, they should mix it up and make it as unpredictable as possible. Or keep the ball in hand.England will have a similar focus to the first two weeks and will try to put pressure on the back three. A lot will depend on whether Liam Williams is at full-back or if Leigh Halfpenny returns. If it is Williams I would expect England to keep the ball away from him, George North can be turned and targeted aerially, as can Josh Adams, so they will go after the wings. If it is Halfpenny, I expect a lot more contestable kicks because he is not the biggest but is so good positionally there will simply not be the same amount of space.But more important for England will be the power game. There has not been a lot of play from deep, not a great deal of in-phase play, so they will look to win the territorial battle and use the power of Manu Tuilagi and the Vunipolas, should Mako be fit, in the right areas of the field. England will go to Cardiff with the belief that their forwards will win the battle against the Wales pack.England would not be kicking as much against the southern hemisphere teams because Australia and New Zealand have a greater ability to play more from deep. England want to win the Six Nations, though, and they are employing the right tactics to do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f1baf15a5aa50181bbdf3825b78f6ff2a82f97a/249_42_4604_2762/master/4604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2511b9a9a3802b63a274c2d912f7506c","title":"grand national weights bristol de mai aintree","story":"Martin Greenwood may allow the grey into the race on a reduced rating to continue attempting to attract quality horsesBristol De Mai is very likely to be given a lenient weight for the Grand National when the list of weights is published later on Tuesday, according to a clear hint dropped by the handicapper Martin Greenwood, who will frame the race for the first time. Greenwood takes over the job from the retired Phil Smith and plans to continue with Smith’s methods, including compression of the top end of the weights, a policy which has made the Aintree race more attractive to quality horses.“I’m certainly going to be using certain guidelines that Phil had,” Greenwood told me in his first interview on the subject. He would not say exactly how he will handle Bristol De Mai’s lofty rating of 173 but sounded very much as though he was prepared to drop it by a few pounds for the purpose of making this National more competitive.“If Bristol De Mai runs off 173,” he said, “that would leave horses on 149 at the bottom weight of 10 stone. That could leave a whole host of horses out of the handicap and I’m fully aware of the implications of doing that. I’ll be looking very closely at that aspect, probably more than any other horse.”Had the grey run in last year’s National off 173, half the 40-strong field would have been “out of the handicap”, or, in other words, carrying more weight than would be justified by their rating, because no horse is allowed to carry less than 10 stone. Rather than leave the connections of 20 horses feeling their runner is at a disadvantage with all the best horses in the race, Greenwood is likely to focus the fears of those people on Bristol De Mai, allowing him into the National on a reduced rating and moving all the other horses up the weights towards him.“As a National fan all my life, it’s an honour and a privilege to be a small part of it,” Greenwood said. “Because it’s my first National, I’m going to do as much research as possible.”He did not enthuse over the concept of an “Aintree factor”, used in the past to justify giving a bit of extra weight to horses who have repeatedly run well in the National, which might on occasion help them make the cut for the race. “That’s probably something a bit more from yesteryear,” he said. “I think the race has moved on, it’s a better quality handicap than it’s ever been.”Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsGreenwood dismisses any suggestion that Irish horses might be generally well treated in Britain, having filled the first four places in last year’s National. He noted that British handicappers keep their own performance ratings for Irish races and use those to produce ratings for Irish horses when they race here, so it is not the case that the Irish handicapper’s work is simply copied.Amid the pleasure of setting his own weights for the National, Greenwood is braced for criticism from any owners who feel their horse has been harshly treated when his work is unveiled. “You get pressure from owners and trainers all week, every day. So, while this is a more advertised pressure, it’s the same story we get regularly, just on a more inflated basis. It wouldn’t ever stop me putting a horse on what I think it is. I’m not aiming to upset anybody but I’ve got to do what I think is right.”• The National weights will be listed on this page from 3pm GMT."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps. We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

The former airline’s stylish terminal building, designed by Eero Saarinen and opened in 1962, is being redeveloped into a 512-bedroom property. The midcentury modern-inspired hotel will open on 15 May, with bookings starting on 14 February (at noon EST, 5pm GMT).The original 1962 building, known as the TWA Flight Center, will be the hotel’s main hub, featuring six restaurants, eight bars, shops and a rooftop pool, while two new “wings” will house the guestrooms. The 1960s-style interiors will include midcentury modern Saarinen furniture, retro TWA posters, rewired vintage rotary phones and views of the runways through noise-cancelling floor-to-ceiling windows.The original neofuturist structure includes a winged, thin shell roof and fluid, open design, which the architect hoped would evoke the sensation of flight. It became a designated New York City Landmark in 1994 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The redevelopment includes renovation of the arched, red-carpeted flight tubes – as seen in Steven Spielberg’s 2002 film Catch Me If You Can – which connect it to terminal five. The hotel will also feature a classic Italian Solari split-flap mechanical message board, a large observation deck and a museum dedicated to the Jet Age, with vintage uniforms, original in-flight amenities and other memorabilia.A 1958 Lockheed Constellation airplane has also been transformed into a cocktail lounge just outside the hotel. Originally commissioned in 1939 by TWA owner Howard Hughes, the “Connie” model broke the transcontinental speed record in 1946. This particular plane, Connie N8083H, is one of only four remaining of its kind, and has been restored with original parts, including cockpit controls. It had a colourful former life, shuttling supplies to Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in the 60s before being modified to airdrop marijuana from in South America, and abandoned in Honduras in the 80s.Managed by MCR and Morse Development, the hotel has been under construction since late 2016 and is expected to be popular with “avgeeks”, preservationists and Mad Men fans as well as JFK stopover travellers.

She has been working for two weeks straight, with no break at the weekend, and she has six-year-old twins, a boy and a girl. “So I’m a wee bit tired. But good, really good,” she says. She is dipping into her free time to talk about her new TV series, Flack, because she is not only starring in it, but executive-producing it, too, and it is co-produced through her own company, Casm. She has spent five years trying to get it off the ground, in stops and starts, and they finished filming it just four days before we meet. Hence the tiredness? She nods. “It’s not a name-only credit. I’m a huge control freak. I’m involved in every single aspect of every single decision.”In person, Paquin is brisk, earnest and articulate, and careful with her words. She was born in Canada in 1982, but grew up in New Zealand, then moved to the US as a teenager for work. She has been in front of the camera since she was nine, when she was cast in Jane Campion’s film The Piano. “I entered this industry in a very backwards sort of way,” she says. “I did one job, won an Oscar, and then people said: ‘Ooh, you have a career now.’” She points out, though, that there is a wealth of talented women in her age group, which means she will “still have to audition my arse off for stuff I really want”, but it does mean that she can generally work on things that she wants to. “I do have the luxury of being a little more choosy because of the circumstances of my career.”In Flack, Paquin is Robyn, a hard-living, self-destructive type who works in the crisis-management area of public relations. The show is a lot of fun, and reminds me what good TV was like before shows developed grand cinematic ambitions. It’s outrageous, a little bit camp and darkly comic in tone. “Oh, it goes places, and it keeps going places,” Paquin says with a smile, admitting that it speaks to her sense of humour. In the first episode, Robyn has to cover up a philandering TV chef and a footballer’s drug-fuelled gay tryst, all the while juggling her own issues, which seem to involve a lot of cocaine. “Some people will be offended, other people will be laughing so hard they’re going to snort coffee through their nose while they’re watching it.” That’s a state of affairs that suits her. “I want people to absolutely love it, or, possibly, be violently like: ‘How could you?’” Would she take that as a compliment? “Oh, yeah. It means that we did it properly.”Oliver Lansley, who wrote and created Flack, told Deadline Hollywood that with Robyn, he wanted to create a female character who could stand alongside “difficult men” such as Tony Soprano, Mad Men’s Don Draper and Breaking Bad’s Walter White. Paquin feels passionately that stories about “complicated women” should be told. “I mean, take Dexter. Male protagonists get to quite literally be serial killers and the audience still loves them. Whereas traditionally, if female characters put one foot out of line, from the sort of patriarchal ideals of what a perfect woman is like, then you have to watch them being punished for it. And I really am enjoying the fact that I’m part of a generation of women in film where we can just tell interesting, complicated stories about people who happen to be women.”What’s changed? “The power balance has changed,” she says. “There are more women in executive and behind-the-scenes roles who have just had enough of being told what we can and can’t do. And women like myself going: ‘OK, I’ve been doing this for 27 years I’m not going to sit around and wait for those roles to show up. I’m going to go out there, find it, create it and make it happen for myself.’”There is a reason, she suggests, that it takes more time for women to step into positions of power. “One has to work extra-hard as a woman in a very male-dominated industry. As an actress walking on to a film set, you’re guilty until proven innocent. They assume you’re going to be a pain in the arse, high-maintenance and difficult, and you usually spend the first couple of weeks having to work hard to prove that you’re not going to be a problem because you’re a woman. And I think we’re all just collectively done with that.”I ask her about her experiences of being an adolescent in a business like this, and she takes a deep breath. “You’d need a year to really get into the broad strokes of that one. Look, I’ve had some really amazing experiences, and I’ve had some absolutely horrific experiences. People treat people who have no power, sometimes, in ways that are completely unacceptable. But when you’re a child and you don’t know any different, and you don’t want to get into trouble, you just keep your mouth shut.”She is cautiously optimistic that, in these more open times, sets are being made safer, and women might be able to make it a better industry. “When I see younger girls on set, or kids, that I once looked at thinking: ‘Please, dear God, get out of the film industry,’ I now think: ‘Actually, we might be able to make this a safe environment for young people in positions of no power.’”Paquin almost gave up acting in her late teens. She enrolled at Columbia University, planning to study French and English literature. Her mother is an English teacher, so she thought she might follow in her footsteps, or perhaps write. But theatre reignited her enthusiasm, and she went on to appear in a series of blockbusters, including a stint as Rogue in the X-Men film franchise. In 2008, she took her first TV role, as Sookie Stackhouse in the supernatural series True Blood, and it was a huge hit.In 2014, while promoting the show, she sat down with the talkshow host Larry King, who asked her a series of what she found to be intrusive questions about its sex scenes. “I’m not saying that the generation thing is an excuse … but I do legitimately think he is of a generation where certain kinds of entertainment didn’t exist, probably, when he was growing up,” she says. Would that line of questioning happen now, even five years later? “I do think in general people are a little bit more careful about how they ask women questions about anything to do with sex, sexuality and provocative content. As they should be.”She adds that he got more stick for asking her about being bisexual, and whether she was a “former bisexual” because she had married Stephen Moyer, her True Blood co-star. “He got the shit kicked out of him by the LGBT community.” Paquin, who came out as bisexual in 2010, says that misunderstandings are fairly common. “People understand the version of the world they live in, and if it’s outside their experience, then sometimes it frightens people, or they just don’t get it. And that’s fine.” She has worked with LGBT advocacy charities for years, and her Twitter and Instagram feeds suggest she’s more than happy to get into discussions with people who disagree with her. “I don’t want to hit somebody over the head with something and go: ‘You’re stupid.’ I want to explain things to people,” she says.With Flack, there is a sense that Paquin is pulling back the curtain on showbiz. It is heightened, of course, but nevertheless it speaks of the uneasy relationship between the illusion of fame and the reality of it. “When you have a job that involves being everything to everybody at all times, being a chameleon, what does that do to your sense of your real self? How do you maintain a grasp on reality when your job is constantly playing with reality?” she asks. She’s talking about her character, but I tell her that it sounds like a good question for an actor, too. “Yes,” she laughs, quietly. “You could say that.”Flack starts on Thursday 21 February at 10pm on W."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08f2a914803ad9e2a60dea5e4c10bae2a75c82af/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c129a16dd4a4daa0894baad5753210d5","title":"sarah jessica parker what would carrie bradshaw be like in 2019","story":"Sex and the City’s shoe-loving star returned to TV in a beer commercial. But what would a 2019 Carrie’s socials look like?Carrie Bradshaw is back! Well, she appeared in a Super Bowl ad for Stella Artois at least. So what would she be doing in 2019? “I’m sure she has a lot to write about given what’s happened in this country over the last two years politically (and) socially,” Sarah Jessica Parker told E! recently. “I think she would be deeply engaged in those conversations.” Clearly, these conversations would be happening online – and definitely on Instagram. Below is Carrie’s imagined Insta feed and what themes would be thirsting for ‘likes’ …Loose attempts to ‘join the conversation’ politicallyWe might not have known it in 2003, but Carrie Bradshaw is fake deep. Like fashion or the personal problems of her friends, politics surely also exists to Carrie only as a window into what might be going on in her own life (“with everything going on generally in healthcare, I had to wonder: is heartbreak a pre-existing condition?”). Still, Carrie’s never-ending fountain of puns would be put to good use in this era of the viral protest sign. I’m sure Miranda made the whole gang pussy hats.Subtle photos of Big that he asked her not to postObviously, John would not have Instagram. In fact, it seems extremely likely that he would have had a stern conversation with Carrie about not wanting to be anyone’s #relationshipgoals. His wife, on the other hand, literally built a career out of being one of those people who compulsively “my boyfriend”s five minutes into any conversation. It stands to reason, then, that Carrie would become a master of the uninvited candid: snapping Big reading the newspaper, hanging back a little to catch him walking away, maybe even catching bae slippin, all in service of a stealthy #mcm.Book stacks in sunlightThis is an undeniable staple of writerly Instagram: a way to assert one’s taste, brag about getting cool galleys early, and make good use of the way the light hits the coffee table in the afternoon. Carrie’s version of the manicure-on-a-manuscript post would have to be a little lighter than average … perhaps a stack of her own books? A discreet but searing burn on whatever trash Berger published recently? Or maybe back issues of Vogue, instead of dinner … It would feed her more likes.Shoes, duh!Full-on flat lays are a younger woman’s game, and I’m sure Ms Bradshaw would have much to say about the Caroline Calloways of the world, but at the end of the day I doubt our girl is above a classic bright-tiles-and-fancy shoes snap. After all, Carrie was proposed to via Manolo. This is her version of the “nothing to see here, just a nice pumpkin spice latte and my engagement ring SOMEHOW snuck into frame!” shot clogging everyone’s feeds around Christmas and Valentine’s. Showing off fancy footwear is a hallmark of Sarah Jessica Parker’s real-life Instagram, too.Meaningful quotes“She thought she could … so she did.” “It’s not the number of breaths you take, but the moments that take your breath away.” Most of the inspirational quotes floating around Instagram in a curly font could have easily originated in one of Carrie’s columns. Would she mine the accounts of yoga hotties for important thoughts of the day? I think so. Could we see her accidentally posting an ironic meme with full sincerity, having misjudged the picture of the sunset behind it? Probably. Might she put a fun Bradshaw spin on a done-to-death UK classic and Keep Calm, Carrie On? Yes, and I’m sorry.Thot-y Throwback ThursdaysWhat are #tbts for if not showcasing iconic looks and visible nipples gone by? This would be, I think, Carrie at her IG best: looking back on the sartorial choices of a simpler time, and the various stolen shoes and naked dresses that came with it. Carrie is the kind of woman whose happy birthday posts are always throwbacks where she looks amazing and the friend in them wasn’t quite ready for the photo: “Happy birthday to the amazing, strong, fiery Miranda. Here she is moments after giving birth … I had just run in from a fashion show!”Plane wingsIf you think Carrie is above a picture of some clouds from the air, you’re sorely mistaken. Get a few in-flight vodkas in her and she’ll be marvelling at the mechanics of flight with the rest of Instagram.

New Zealand news website Stuff claimed to have spoken to multiple sources saying the turnback was down to a “reference to Taiwan which China took to be an acknowledgement that the island was independent”.Air New Zealand did not respond to questions about a Taiwan link but said “as is required, the application includes a list of destinations the airline operates to, including Taipei”.China has a history of demanding international airlines not refer to Taiwan’s independence or nationhood on its websites or promotional material, and in the past has urged Qantas, Air Canada and others to change how it refers to the island.John Nicholson, CEO of industry body Aviation New Zealand described the incident as “very unusual”.“Aviation is a highly regulated market, and China is a highly regulated market and everyone has to do everything by the letter of the law,” he said.“It gets into the political situation and the way the different governments recognise or don’t recognise states, and I would think Air New Zealand would be guided very much by what the New Zealand government position is … therefore look at it in context of the New Zealand government’s relationship with China.”Opposition leader Simon Bridges suggested the returned flight was indicative of increasingly tense relations between China and New Zealand. “We need to know what has happened here. Is it part of the ongoing deterioration in relations between this NZ Govt \u0026amp China?” Bridges tweeted.Prime minister Jacinda Ardern responded saying “it was wrong” to view the incident as politically motivated.“Our relationship with China is a complex relationship, it sometimes will have its challenges, but they remain an incredibly important economic and people-to-people partner.”Ardern cancelled her first planned state visit in November 2018 because both parties were too busy. She said the two countries “continued to discuss dates” for a visit sometime in 2019.Relations between the two countries have become increasingly strained in recent months, following a recommendation from New Zealand’s spy agency that the roll-out of 5G by Huawei posed “significant national security risks”.Subsequently New Zealand telco company Spark said it would not use the company as part of the 5G roll-out, although justice minister Andrew Little has stopped short of calling it a ban.A major joint tourism event to be unveiled in Wellington between the two countries has also been postponed, with reports that China refused to send any government ministers to attend.China’s foreign affairs spokesperson Hua Chunying said the Air New Zealand flight had turned around on its own accord. “Due to temporary glitch in dispatchment, this airplane failed to obtain a landing permit with its destination and decided of its own accord to return en route.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6987ed577939bac8e1e6457299e59a79c023d56/0_75_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f48c6f8090368050ff621b1e88af0f2c","title":"italy matteo salvini mafia immigration security focus","story":"Organised crime increasingly being forgotten in favour of anti-migrant efforts, say observersIn recent decades, the ruthless Casalesi clan of the Camorra mafia has earned billions of euros by burying more than 150,000 cubic metres of toxic waste in the countryside north of Naples.So last Thursday night, when 90 carabinieri paramilitary police officers surrounded several apartment buildings in Caserta, the provincial capital, many residents thought an anti-mafia blitz was under way. The targets were in fact immigrants, under scrutiny for sanitary inspections of their homes.On Sunday, Salvini announced the interior ministry would review spending on police protection for men and women under threat from the mafia, declaring “some people have been under police escort for too long”.In Catania, the eastern Sicilian stronghold of the powerful Santapaola clan, prosecutors are investigating NGO rescue boats, one of which was ordered to be seized in November after fears that discarded clothes worn by people arriving from Libya could have been contaminated with HIV.In Riace, part of Reggio Calabria, from where the feared ‘Ndrangheta is thought to control much of Europe’s cocaine trade, Mimmo Lucano, an anti-mafia mayor who revitalised his community by welcoming asylum seekers, has been under investigation since October on suspicion of aiding illegal immigration. Lucano has had repeated death threats from mafiosi, who also poisoned two of his dogs.In the past eight months, nearly 250 of Salvini’s tweets have addressed immigration, compared with 60 about organised crime.The evictions followed the approval of the “Salvini decree”, which removed humanitarian protections for those not eligible for refugee status and suspended the asylum application process for iniduals considered “socially dangerous”.Claudio Fava, the head of Sicily’s anti-mafia commission, whose father was murdered by the mafia in 1984, said: “The new security decree is a mirror of Salvini’s propaganda.“The law addresses almost exclusively immigration, but a security decree should also be concerned with the mafia, which is clearly not a priority for Salvini. The only element in the decree that mentions the mafia regards the seizure of property.”The Salvini decree established that villas confiscated from mafiosi would be auctioned off publicly after a certain time. Experts have questioned this, citing the likelihood that properties could be purchased by citizens acting as stand-ins for mafia bosses.It feels as though the Italian mafias no longer make headlines, but others do. The interior ministry has carried out a ferocious campaign against what Salvini has described as a worse menace – the mysterious Nigerian mafia. In recent months, magistrates have arrested numerous iniduals within the Nigerian community on suspicion of belonging to mafia clans.Many investigators point out the Nigerian clans are subordinate to the Italian mafias, but Salvini and his supporters have been swift in justifying anti-immigration policies in the face of what they describe as an “invasion” of alleged African mafia bosses, which has risked aggravating racial prejudice.The linking of migrant communities and organised crime has echoes of the past in Italy. Between 1880 and 1915, 4 million Italians reached the US, a small minority of whom were tied to the mafia, the largest criminal organisation in the world.Mario Del Pero, a professor of international history at Sciences Po, said: “The anti-Italian prejudice, or rather ‘Italophobia’, was very strong in the United States. Its origins ranged from widespread hostility against the Catholic church to labelling Italians as criminals. Restrictive laws passed in 1921 and 1924 were written precisely to keep Italians out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed03c9d97053cad8aa3db1b12ee312f721a68fcd/0_489_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15893b0d4c90dc41196ef109dfa31487","title":"sticky situation usb found in seal faeces reunited with owner","story":"Amanda Nally, a seal enthusiast, had helped scientists to collect the sample 12 months earlierThe owner of a USB stick which was found in the frozen faeces of a rare leopard seal in New Zealand has been tracked down after a nationwide search and revealed to be a seal enthusiast who had helped collect the sample 12 months earlier.Last week the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) put out of a call for the owner of a USB stick they had recovered from the scat of a leopard seal, which had sat in a scientist’s freezer for more than a year, waiting to be examined.The USB stick was functional and revealed footage of an unidentified person in a blue kayak filming two sea lion pups on the southland coast on the South Island.That person was Amanda Nally, the only sea lion volunteer on the entire south coast, who spotted the footage on the nightly news and immediately recognised it.In a strange twist, Nally was the good Samaritan who phoned the leopard seal hotline in December 2017, reporting that she had found an animal on Oreti Beach looking thin.A vet was dispatched to examine the animal, which is usually found in Antarctic waters. While the seal was being checked over Nally spotted an intact scat, and suggested it be sent to Niwa for analysis.Leopard seal faeces is valuable to scientists because it holds a wealth of information about what the Antarctic predators eat, their general health and how long they have been in New Zealand waters.The leopard seal was deemed in reasonable health, and the scat was dispatched north by courier. Unbeknown to Nally, it concealed her lost USB stick.Nally initially thought she must have dropped the device while examining the leopard seal, but Niwa scientists are convinced the tale is even stranger, and more unlikely.“The USB stick was embedded deep in the poo. Niwa are convinced that a bird ate my USB stick, and the leopard seal then ate the bird, because he had a lot of feathers in the scat. And then bizarrely I come along and say ‘oh there’s a sample we should send to Niwa’,” Nally said.A Niwa spokesperson confirmed the theory.Nally said she had told Niwa they could keep the USB stick as she had the footage backed up in various places.“No one needs to spend $1 on the postage, I have many copies of this footage, it is some of my favourite”.Nally is aware how strange this string of events is.“This is probably the weirdest set of coincidences in my life – ever.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b12ee463258637117b94a435f3517ddef4d64bd/203_548_3196_1917/master/3196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5b6526a545992f4110a1ee39c0dcd3e","title":"tuesday briefing pantomime of brexit baffles europeans","story":"Latest developments in our ‘national psychodrama’ … Trump campaigns for his wall in El Paso … and giant windfarm to open off YorkshireHello, it’s Warren Murray, and I would like to draw your attention to the following matters.“It’s a mixture of bemusement and bewilderment … a pantomime you can’t stop watching,” says Michiel van Hulten, a Dutch former member of the European parliament. “A national psychodrama,” is how one French commentator puts it. “I think it is time Britain left now,” says a German professor.

It stems from the unilateral referendum on independence that was held in autumn 2017 by the Catalan regional government, in defiance of Spain’s national government and the courts. Spain’s ambassador to London, Carlos Bastarreche, has said in a rare public intervention that the trial is not political and the proceedings are of “paramount importance to Spain’s reputation as a modern democracy”. The Catalan government has embarked on a vigorous diplomatic and PR campaign to portray the proceedings as a show trial. Nine of those on trial are accused of rebellion while those on the most serious charges could face up to 25 years in jail.Tehran vs Trump in war of words – Iran and the United States have hurled epithets at each other on the 40th anniversary of the Islamic republic. Cries of “Death to America” rang out in Tehran while President Hassan Rouhani called Donald Trump an “idiot” and defied calls for a fresh agreement to curb Iran’s missile programme: “We have not, and will not, request permission from anyone for increasing our defensive power and for building all kinds of … missiles.” Trump tweeted that Iran could only mark “40 years of failure … The long-suffering Iranian people deserve a much brighter future.” The Israeli PM reacted to an Iranian Revolutionary Guard threat to “raze” Israeli cities if the US attacked Iran. “It would mean that they had celebrated their last Revolution Day,” said Benjamin Netanyahu. “They would do well to take that into account.”Vane power – A windfarm off the Yorkshire coast that will eventually be the world’s largest is to supply its first power to the UK electricity grid this week. Hornsea One is planned to cover 407 sq km, five times the size of the nearby city of Hull, with 174 turbines providing 1.2GW of capacity – enough to power a million homes. It is due to be completed in the second half of this year by Danish developer Ørsted. About half of the components for the project are made in the UK, in places like Hull, Teeside and Campbeltown in the Scottish highlands. The UK has enough wind and shallow enough seabeds to “power most of Europe”, says Henrik Poulsen, Ørsted CEO. On a lesser scale, new windfarms could make up for cancelled UK nuclear power stations.Something to process – More than half the UK diet is ultra-processed food that, according to researchers, is linked to risk of premature death. A study followed 44,000 people for seven years, monitoring how much of their diet came from foods made in factories with industrial ingredients and additives, such as dried ready meals, cakes and biscuits. Those who died by the end of the study were likely to have eaten a greater amount of ultra-processed food, the researchers found. Commenting on the study, Nita Forouhi, a professor of epidemiology at Cambridge, said such foods tended to be eaten disproportionately by poorer people: “They tend to be cheaper, are highly palatable due to high sugar, salt and saturated fat content, are widely available, highly marketed, ready to eat, and their use-by dates are lengthy, so they last longer.

Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVenezuelan migrants climb on a truck on the road from Cúcuta to Pamplona in  Colombia as humanitarian aid is blocked from entering the country. Photograph: Raul ArboledaAFPIn dismissing the need for the international aid operation being organised by his political opponents, President Nicolás Maduro defiantly said Venezuelans are not anyone’s beggars.Like others who have made it here and cannot afford to get anywhere else, Aida Farfan ekes out her days approaching cars stopped at red lights, her two-year-old daughter in one arm, the other asking for the small change she hopes will be enough to buy them an evening meal.Four months ago, Aida and her husband left their home on the outskirts of the Venezuelan capital Caracas in search of one thing only – food. “He had a good job working for a delivery company,” she explains. “He earned a minimum wage but that used to be enough. But now with hyperinflation it buys you nothing, if there was something to buy. But there isn’t. Even the state-run supermarkets are empty. I had to think of my child so we left.”Like most of the estimated one million who have fled into Colombia, Aida crossed over the Simón Bolívar International Bridge, named after the South American liberator who was the supposed inspiration for the populist Bolivarian revolution of Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez.Closed to all but foot traffic since 2015, it is the busiest of the two frontier bridges open, an estimated 40,000 people crossing it daily.Others are hawking goods they hope to sell for money to buy the food and medicines they can no longer get back across the border, turning the hardscrabble neighbourhood of Parada that borders it into a ramshackle open-air market where everything is negotiable.Erika Martes and her cousin, Sonia, head back across the bridge after buying food and basic supplies (Parada does a roaring trade in toilet paper). “Some of our family got out to Ecuador and they are able to send us the money to buy food here,” says Erika. She still has a job back in Venezuela, but with inflation heading for 10 million per cent this year “your salary isn’t worth anything. What I earn in a month is not enough even to buy one bottle of gas.”But for the poorest of those who have crossed over, the neighbourhood has become a temporary home. They sleep in its litter-strewn squares at night, occasionally harassed by local police and vulnerable to the criminal paramilitaries that control the region, which has long been home to a thriving contraband trade.Among those wandering the dusty streets desperate for help is Maribel Mantilla, medical prescription in hand. She travelled more than 1,250km from Venezuela’s Caribbean island of Margarita to Cúcuta because, lacking a passport, she knew she could at least cross into Colombia using only her identity card.The grandmother came with her family in part to find medicine to treat her stomach tumour. But she cannot even afford the €5 to fulfil the prescription she was given by the medics who attended her. Her daughter and granddaughters who travelled with her cut off their long hair and, for €15, sold it to the wigmakers who hawk for business among those coming over the bridge. “But that went on food. Now we are desperate,” she says, tears filling her eyes.Severe malnourishmentThe situation has become so critical, say relief workers at the bridge, that they are seeing more and more cases of severe malnourishment among those arriving.“Our medical staff see kids here who should weigh 12kg but instead are just four,” says David Cañas, the priest in charge of a soup kitchen run by the Catholic diocese of Cúcuta. The kitchen opened in the middle of 2017 serving 700 lunches a day. Now when supplies stretch, it feeds 5,000, with another 2,000 getting a light breakfast of coffee and bread.Even then it has to turn people away. “Because of the demand we now have to focus on women and children and the elderly. We receive people here who travel up to four hours from Venezuela just to get a plate of soup here before they head back,” says Fr David.Among those grateful for the soup kitchen is Endrina Zentenas. She and her three young children were unable to eat on Sunday and Monday’s breakfast at the kitchen broke an enforced fast. “It is very difficult for us all. More and more Venezuelans keep arriving. We cannot live any more in our own country so people will keep coming here. We need help!”Humanitarian aid is arriving in Cúcuta, organised by Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who declared himself interim president last month in the latest bid to eject Maduro from power. But his goal is to transport it this week over another bridge in Cúcuta into Venezuela itself. On Monday, the opposition said more than 100,000 people had already signed up as volunteers to receive and distribute the aid.But the Venezuelan military has blockaded the Tienditas Bridge over which the aid is supposed to pass and many of the refugees in Cúcuta have no doubt Maduro will be true to his word and keep it out. While they acknowledge the situation back in Venezuela is increasingly desperate, they also ask if the aid, or at least some of it, could not be distributed among Venezuelans in Cúcuta if it cannot cross the border.“The thing is we all know that if the aid crosses into Venezuela it will be robbed by the . . ,” says Herman Rojas, who instead of finishing his sentence taps his shoulders to refer to the criminal mafias headed up by high-ranking officers in the Venezuelan security forces."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3790864.1549953052!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"deal reached in principle in bid to avert new us shutdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t President Donald Trump speaks during a rally at the El Paso County Coliseum on Monday in El Paso, Texas. Photograph: Joe RaedleGetty ImagesDemocrats and Republicans reached a tentative agreement on Monday evening that could avert a government shutdown at the end of this week, but it remains unclear if US president Donald Trump will endorse it.Lawmakers from both parties met in Congress on Monday evening in a last-ditch attempt to find a bipartisan solution to the funding impasse which threatens to shut the government on Friday if spending bills are not signed.According to members of Congress present at the meeting, agreement was reached “in principle” on a deal. It includes $1.375 billion (€1.22 billion) for a physical border - far less than the $5.7 billion (€5.05 billion)demanded by Mr Trump for his proposed wall with Mexico. The agreement also envisages a reduction in the number of migrants that can be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, a key demand of Democrats and an issue that had led to the breakdown of talks over the weekend.But the agreement must still be signed off by the US president. Asked if the White House would back the deal, Republican senator Richard C Shelby said “we think so we hope so.”The apparent breakthrough in negotiations in Washington took place as Mr Trump held a rally in El Paso, Texas. Flanked by enormous red banners with the phrase “Finish the Wall,” Mr Trump told the crowd: “Today, we started the big beautiful wall right on the Rio Grande,” a reference to the river that separates the United States from Mexico in Texas.Responding to chants of “build that wall,” Mr Trump said: “You should say ‘Finish the Wall,’ because we’ve got a lot of it built already.”But he appeared to suggest that he was not open to compromise on the need for a full border wall.“As I was walking up to the stage, they said that progress is being made with this committee,” he said during his speech. “Just so you know, we’re building the wall anyway.”He also referenced Democrats demands to cap the number of immigrants that are detained by ICE officers.“I will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of criminals into this country,” he said.Denounces DemocratsIn a free-flowing speech he claimed that 60,000 people had applied to attend the rally, but only 10,000 had been permitted to enter. “Is there anywhere more fun than a Trump rally?” he said to cheers.His speech also touched on abortion, as he denounced Democrats for supporting what he called “extreme late-term abortion,” as well as the controversy surrounding Virginia governor Ralph Northam who has been accused of racial insensitivity following revelations that he previously appeared in “blackface.” “I like him. Keeps us out of the papers,” he said of the beleaguered Democrat.Similarly, he returned to some of the themes of his state of the union address last week.“America will never be a socialist country,” he said. “We will live free, we will die free. We will always be free.”The former congressman held his own rally less than a mile away from the El Paso County Coliseum where Mr. Trump was speaking. “We stand for America and we stand against walls,” Mr O’Rourke said as he addressed a crowd of about 10,000 people.The US president has repeatedly claimed that crime in El Paso plummeted after the construction of a border wall near the city, a claim that local officials have denounced. During his rally, Mr Trump said that the city’s leaders were “full of crap” by claiming that a wall did not reduce crime.All eyes will be on the White House on Tuesday and Mr Trump’s response to the congressional proposal amid fears that the US government is heading for another government shutdown on Friday if new funding legislation is not agreed. It follows a 35-day shutdown - the longest in history - which ended last month after Mr Trump agreed to sign a set of bills without funding for his border wall.Mr Trump could also declare a national emergency to secure money for the wall - a procedure which would allow him to bypass Congress and tap department of defence funding directly. But such a move would face fierce resistance from Democrats and some Republicans who are concerned about an overreach in presidential power. It would almost certainly face legal challenges in the courts."},{"url":null,"title":"kumbh mela worlds largest religious gathering pictures","story":"Thousands of Hindu devout arrive to take a dip at Sangam, the confluence of three sacred rivers the Yamuna, the Ganges and the mythical Saraswati, on Monday, as part of the Kumbh Mela or Pitcher Festival, in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh state, IndiaBrexit latest news: Andrea Leadsom tells Tory MPs not to be \u0026#39purist\u0026#39 about changes to the Irish backstopValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Why Cupid and love hearts are associated with this romantic dateDuchess of Sussex being \u0026#39vilified and chased in same way that Diana was\u0026#39, says George ClooneySeventeen die in Delhi hotel fireDangerous criminals could abscond if UK loses access to EU records if there is a no-deal Brexit, says police chiefCall for Lords of Chaos film about suicide and satanism to be bannedComment: Karren Brady must now distance  herself from Sir Philip Green -

But nowhere is the prospect of regime change more likely than Sudan.Almost since the revolt began on December 19, rapidly spreading to towns and cities across Sudan, young medics have been at the forefront of the protests demanding Mr Bashir’s regisnation. They have also been among its most prominent victims, none more so than Babiker Abdelhamid, who was shot dead in Khartoum on January 17.Dr Babiker, who was 27, was only one of 45 people who have been killed by the security forces since the protests began, according to human rights groups. But the nature of his death, and the controversy it has ignited, has become a rallying call for the protesters, increasing rather than diminishing their determination to oust the president.According to witnesses, Dr Babiker walked out of his home, where he had been treating protesters,  and attempted to beg security officers to allow him to take the wounded to hospital. Moments later, a gunshot rang out and an hour later he was dead.“He walked down the street slowly, with his hands raised,” a colleague said. “He was trying to tell them he had critical cases and to ask them to reopen the road to Royal Care Hospital, which they had cut off. Then he was killed.Anti-government protesters rally in Khartoum, SudanFacing mounting outrage, President Bashir attempted to blame the killing on a foreign plot to bring chaos to Sudan. “The doctor who was killed… was killed by a weapon that did not belong to the army, or the NISS (National Intelligence and Security Services, or police,” he told supporters at a rally in the south of the country.“He was killed by someone among the demonstrators.”Yet there is no question that Sudan’s doctors, the most formidable group in a growing array of opponents to the regime, have borne the brunt of Mr Bashir’s increasingly violent and desperate response to the protests. At least one other doctor, Muawiya Khalil, has been killed, allegedly shot dead inside his house. Many more have been arrested, including the head of the Sudan Doctors Syndicate, his deputy and other members of the executive committee.Medics and nurses were beaten up after security forces raided two hospitals in Khartoum, firing live ammunition and teargas into the wards before dragging wounded protesters off their beds and taking them to secret detention centres. The assault on the medical profession partly reflects regime anger at doctors after they called a strike, encouraged other professions to follow suit and then threw open private hospitals to treat the wounded for free.But it is also an indication of the regime’s longstanding fear of the medical profession and the reverence with which it is held in Sudanese society.After seizing power in 1989, Mr Bashir banned independent trade unions, locked up and tortured opponents in secret prisons known as “ghost houses” and silenced dissent.But the doctors refused to be cowed, staging a strike within months of the coup — the regime responded by allegedly torturing to death one of the organisers at one of the ghost houses — and several more since.The medical profession’s opposition to the regime was driven by the distaste of secular doctors towards the coalition of Islamists and military figures that have run it and which allowed bin Laden to live in the country from 1991 to 1996. There was particular fury that Islamist militants were allowed to infiltrate a medical university in Khartoum, where students — including at least 16 Britons — were sent to join ISIL in Syria.But resentment is more deep-seated too. Sudan’s medical service was once among Africa’s most efficient. The Kitchener School of Medicine produced some of the continent’s best doctors.Tear gas is seen as Sudanese demonstrators take part in an an anti-government protest in KhartoumBut in recent decades, the health system has all but collapsed. As the Bashir regime erted government funds towards the military, slashing health expenditure to just two percent of the budget, once-functioning state hospitals became understaffed and poorly equipped. Medicines ran in short supply, free healthcare was mostly abandoned. Corrupt government officials plundered hospitals and ran dodgy procurement tenders. Unable to save lives, doctors were sometimes beaten up by the parents of children who had died in their care.Doctors’ attempts to galvanise public anger largely failed, however, with many Sudanese still too scared to confront their government. But an economic crisis in recent years, the legacy of US sanctions, lifted in 2016, and economic mismanagement in a country ranked by Transparency International as among the six most corrupt in the world, has changed the dynamic. Starved of cash, the government began printing money, sending inflation soaring to 70 percent, second only to Venezuela.Forced to adopt austerity measures, Mr Bashir lifted subsidies on basic staples, causing bread prices to treble. The rapid devaluation of the Sudanese pound had meant that the price of medicines, which are mostly imported, soaring by between 150 percent and 300 percent in the last 12 months.December’s protests began spontaneously in the city of Atbara, but they were quickly given direction and purpose by the Sudanese Professionals Organisation, an umbrella group dominated by doctors, which has marshalled near daily protests and industrial action across the country.“Demands for major healthcare changes have been repeatedly ignored over the year,” doctors’ groups said in a statement. “There has been a blatant policy of  systematically destroying the once free national health service. Our only option, coupled by our professional duty, was to escalate our protests.”The Bashir regime has thwarted previous protests, killing some 180 people during the last significant uprising in 2013. Yet Sudan observers say that, this time, the fear factor has been broken, with violence increasing rather than deterring the protesters’ determination.Other professionals have joined demands for Mr Bashir’s resignation, including professors at Khartoum University, another hallowed colonial institution that began its days as the Gordon Memorial College in 1902. Other groups, most significantly dock workers at Port Sudan, have joined the strikes.And even Sudan’s normally cautious opposition, sensing Mr Bashir’s growing vulnerability, has come out in support of the protests. Last week, Sadiq al-Mahdi, the bearded Oxford-educated former prime minister overthrown by Mr Bashir in 1989, demanded the president’s resignation.A Sudanese protester carries a portrait of President Omar al-Bashir with Arabic writing that reads \u0026#34down and that is all\u0026#34 Some observers see Mr al-Mahdi, great-grandson of Muhammad Ahmed, the Mahdi whose warriors killed General Gordon in Khartoum in 1885, as a potential candidate to head a transitional government — even though he is 83.President Bashir is not beaten yet. Middle Eastern states say they support the regime and Qatar, which has embarked on a multi-million pound development of the British-built port at Suakin, may bail him out financially. Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group, the Kremlin-linked outfit that has fought in Syria and Ukraine, have been spotted in Khartoum and are possibly assisting the regime’s repression.Yet there are rumours of splits within the regime, with even some of his generals reportedly sensing that only by sacrificing Mr Bashir will the protests, increasingly well organised and ever more determined, end.Some observers say there may be a peaceful way out, with suggestions that the president would be willing to step down if the International Criminal Court dropped its case accusing him of involvement in killing hundreds of thousands during the suppression of a rebellion in the Darfur region.Mohammed Ibrahim, a Sudanese-British billionaire and prominent critic of the Bashir regime, has led calls for the indictment to be lifted, warning that otherwise the demise of one of the Arab world’s most stubborn leaders is likely to be protracted and violent affair.“If that is going to save lives, if it is going to save us from a bloody civil war, let the man go in peace,” Mr Ibrahim told the BBC.Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Brexit latest news: Andrea Leadsom tells Tory MPs not to be \u0026#39purist\u0026#39 about changes to the Irish backstopValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Why Cupid and love hearts are associated with this romantic dateDuchess of Sussex being \u0026#39vilified and chased in same way that Diana was\u0026#39, says George ClooneySeventeen die in Delhi hotel fireDangerous criminals could abscond if UK loses access to EU records if there is a no-deal Brexit, says police chiefCall for Lords of Chaos film about suicide and satanism to be bannedComment: Karren Brady must now distance  herself from Sir Philip Green -

It will be able to filter out foreign content it doesn\u0027t like. Last week, Google reportedly agreed to receive lists of sites banned by Roskomnadzor every day and to block some of them. So far, it\u0027s blocked three-fourths of the sites forbidden in Russia.  The state audit chamber opposed the sovereign internet legislation last week on the grounds that it would lead to a rise in the cost of goods and services. Budget expenditures will be required to help telecoms implement the technology and pay for additional staff at Roskomnadzor.Human rights group Agora called the bill a “serious threat to internet freedom” in a recent report.  But the cabinet of ministers and Vladimir Putin\u0027s internet adviser have spoken out in favour of the law. The president famously once called the internet a “CIA project”.Moscow is seen to be moving toward a model similar to the “great firewall” of China, where certain keywords are blocked and users can\u0027t connect to blacklisted sites including Facebook.Western countries have threatened sanctions against Russia over cyberattacks.Four Russian military intelligence agents were expelled from the Netherlands in April for allegedly trying to hack into the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\u0026#39 networkMoscow has been accused in recent years of hacking the Democratic National Committee in the United States, a Novichok testing lab in the Netherlands and the World Anti-Doping Agency and International Olympic Committee. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo traveled to Hungary on Monday in a bid to counter Russian and Chinese influence in Europe. In his meeting with prime minister Viktor Orban, who has a warm relationship with Vladimir Putin, he was expected to warn against the growing reliance on Russian energy there. Speaking in Budapest, Mr Pompeo said Washington wanted to re-engage with the region.The Russian government has been tightening its grip over the internet since social media facilitated huge protests against Mr Putin in 2011-13. With no access to state television, opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been able to reach millions of people with videos about corruption by top officials.In response, the authorities have established an extensive blacklist of banned websites and required popular bloggers to register with the state. Young Russians have faced fines and jail time for social media posts ridiculing the Kremlin or Orthodox Church, and Roskomnadzor has in vain attempted to block the popular encrypted messaging service Telegram.  Under a law requiring citizens\u0027 data to be stored in-country, Moscow has also been trying to force internet giants like Facebook and Twitter to relocate servers to Russia, where its intelligence agencies would have access to them, and blocked the business networking site LinkedIn.Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Andrea Leadsom tells Tory MPs not to be \u0026#39purist\u0026#39 about changes to the Irish backstopValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Why Cupid and love hearts are associated with this romantic dateDuchess of Sussex being \u0026#39vilified and chased in same way that Diana was\u0026#39, says George ClooneySeventeen die in Delhi hotel fireDangerous criminals could abscond if UK loses access to EU records if there is a no-deal Brexit, says police chiefCall for Lords of Chaos film about suicide and satanism to be bannedComment: Karren Brady must now distance  herself from Sir Philip Green - and encourage his accusers to speak outWatch the moment a newborn baby is miraculously rescued from storm drain in South AfricaComment: Saving the world is not a job for Left or Right Refugee footballer makes triumphant return to AustraliaUS lawmakers reach tentative deal to avoid government shutdownMan held on suspicion of arson as firefighters tackle huge blaze at mental health hospital NHS ageism means elderly people with depression far less likely to be referred for therapy Planning appeals for controversial housing developments should be cut by five months, official review findsTesco knows more about its customers than NHS does its patients Social media firms that breach duty of care laws \u0026#39must face criminal sanctions\u0026#39US Democrats rocked by anti-Semitism row as Muslim congresswoman apologisesBBC, Facebook and Google face new curbs on their power over news to safeguard quality journalismFamous and Fighting Crime, review: Penny Lancaster stole the show in this arresting reality seriesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 12 february 2019","story":"16 of the world\u0027s up and coming fashion designers create one-off installations for the International Fashion Showcase 2019 previews at Somerset House, ahead of London Fashion Week.

I will die in Australia and I love Australia, he said.Araibi was detained on November 27 while on honeymoon at the request of Bahraini authorities who accuse him of offences linked to the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.His detention sparked worldwide outcry and a protracted diplomatic dispute between Bahrain, Thailand and Australia that raised questions about the neutrality of Interpol and the writ of Canberra’s refugee protections.Araibi had expressed fear that he would be tortured and killed if he returned to Bahrain and supporters alleged his prosecution was politically motivated.Hakeem Al Araibi leaves Thailand\u0026#39s Criminal Court, in Bangkok during court proceedings February 4 2019Prime Minister Scott Morrison led celebration of Araibi’s release, saying many Australians’ prayers had been answered.We know all Australians will deeply appreciate the decision, allowing him to return to his wife, family and friends.Morrison thanked the Thai authorities, who had earlier left his written appeals for Araibi’s return unanswered, but abruptly dropped extradition proceedings on Monday at Bahrain’s request.We have been informed that Bahrain wants to withdraw the (extradition) request... if they don’t want him, we have no reason to keep him here, Chatchom Akapin, a director-general in the Thai prosecutor’s office, said.The case had also become a cause celebre in the football world, with stars like Didier Drogba calling for Araibi’s release and FIFA urging the Thai football authorities to intervene.The international football governing body on Monday thanked Thailand in a statement for doing the right thing and said it hoped the athlete will be able to resume his footballing career soon.Former Australian football captain Craig Foster, who led a campaign in the sporting community for Araibi’s freedom, expressed his deepest gratitude for the news. Craig Foster, former Australian football captain and commentator speaks as refugee Bahraini footballer Hakeem al-Araibi arrives at Melbourne AirportMy thanks go to the wonderful people of Thailand for your support and to the Thai (government) for upholding international law, Foster posted on Twitter.Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said the case had brought the plight of others imprisoned in the country to light.Two moments captured the world’s attention this month: the photo of footballer Hakeem al-Araibi shackled and barefoot, and the moment of Hakeem breaking the chains and reunited with his beloved wife, friends and the football community in Melbourne.Kasit Piromya, a board member of the lobby group ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, said the case showed the failings of Thailand’s outdated laws and policies.Thailand’s treatment of refugees has been thrust under international scrutiny in recent weeks.In January, an 18-year-old Saudi woman who ran away from her family arrived in Bangkok’s airport, and armed with a smartphone and a captive Twitter audience managed to outmanoeuvre Thai authorities and gain refuge in Canada following her pleas for asylum from her abusive family.Bahrain’s reversal of Araibi’s extradition is surprising.Only last week the Gulf state issued a statement defending its decision to pursue the footballer after he fled while awaiting trial, and he was convicted in absentia in 2014 for damaging a police station.But Araibi says his prosecution was motivated by his criticism of Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, a member of Bahrain’s ruling family.A statement from Bahrain’s foreign ministry on Monday said it takes note of the halt in legal proceedings though it did not confirm it had withdrawn its extradition request.The guilty verdict against Mr. Al Araibi remains in place.... (Bahrain) reaffirms its right to pursue all necessary legal actions against (Araibi), the statement said.The reversal came a day after Thailand’s foreign minister met with Bahrain’s Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa in Manama to discuss... areas of interest, according to Bahrain’s state-run news agency.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Andrea Leadsom tells Tory MPs not to be \u0026#39purist\u0026#39 about changes to the Irish backstopValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Why Cupid and love hearts are associated with this romantic dateDuchess of Sussex being \u0026#39vilified and chased in same way that Diana was\u0026#39, says George ClooneySeventeen die in Delhi hotel fireDangerous criminals could abscond if UK loses access to EU records if there is a no-deal Brexit, says police chiefCall for Lords of Chaos film about suicide and satanism to be bannedComment: Karren Brady must now distance  herself from Sir Philip Green - and encourage his accusers to speak outWatch the moment a newborn baby is miraculously rescued from storm drain in South AfricaComment: Saving the world is not a job for Left or Right US lawmakers reach tentative deal to avoid government shutdownMan held on suspicion of arson as firefighters tackle huge blaze at mental health hospital NHS ageism means elderly people with depression far less likely to be referred for therapy Planning appeals for controversial housing developments should be cut by five months, official review findsTesco knows more about its customers than NHS does its patients Social media firms that breach duty of care laws \u0026#39must face criminal sanctions\u0026#39US Democrats rocked by anti-Semitism row as Muslim congresswoman apologisesBBC, Facebook and Google face new curbs on their power over news to safeguard quality journalismFamous and Fighting Crime, review: Penny Lancaster stole the show in this arresting reality seriesComment: Deselecting Brexit rebels would end up poisoning the Tory party – just look at what\u0026#39s happened to LabourWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000124398659_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO2wBkCq2Mm4bNdLs0EhrYzRZ0UrMOuSn1oQkfoARX90.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"saving world not job left right","story":"I used to hate the idea of visiting a rainforest for fear of things landing on me – icky, yucky flying things – but now I needn’t worry.

He did not say whether President Donald Trump would get any money for a US-Mexico border wall.Asked if Trump had signed off on the pact, Shelby said the negotiators talked periodically with White House representatives. Although not saying Trump had endorsed the outline, he added he thought and hoped the president could support the deal.Trump\u0027s December demand for $5.7 billion to help construct the border wall triggered a 35-day partial government shutdown that ended last month without him getting wall funding.Trump agreed to reopen the government for three weeks to allow congressional negotiators time to find a compromise on government funding for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, to avert another shutdown.Democratic Representative Nita Lowey said on Monday night: I hope by Wednesday we\u0027ll have a finished product. Lowey said she had been in touch with House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who she said has confidence I have made the right decision.The stalled talks restarted in the US Capitol just hours before a scheduled rally in the Texas border city of El Paso, where Trump will promote his promised wall along the US-Mexico border, a proposal opposed by Democrats.Beto O\u0026#39Rourke, Democratic former Texas congressman, participates in an anti-Trump march in El Paso, TexasA counter-rally was greeting the Republican president, led by hometown Democrat Beto O\u0027Rourke.The former congressman, who is considering seeking his party\u0027s 2020 presidential nomination, gained national prominence by nearly unseating Republican US Senator Ted Cruz in last November\u0027s elections.In Washington, the small group of lawmakers leading the negotiations met for about two hours.They said they wanted to seal a plan by Monday night to allow time for the legislation to pass the House and Senate and get Trump\u0027s signature by Friday, when funding is due to expire for the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and several other federal agencies.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Andrea Leadsom tells Tory MPs not to be \u0026#39purist\u0026#39 about changes to the Irish backstopValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Why Cupid and love hearts are associated with this romantic dateDuchess of Sussex being \u0026#39vilified and chased in same way that Diana was\u0026#39, says George ClooneySeventeen die in Delhi hotel fireDangerous criminals could abscond if UK loses access to EU records if there is a no-deal Brexit, says police chiefCall for Lords of Chaos film about suicide and satanism to be bannedComment: Karren Brady must now distance  herself from Sir Philip Green - and encourage his accusers to speak outWatch the moment a newborn baby is miraculously rescued from storm drain in South AfricaComment: Saving the world is not a job for Left or Right Refugee footballer makes triumphant return to AustraliaMan held on suspicion of arson as firefighters tackle huge blaze at mental health hospital NHS ageism means elderly people with depression far less likely to be referred for therapy Planning appeals for controversial housing developments should be cut by five months, official review findsTesco knows more about its customers than NHS does its patients Social media firms that breach duty of care laws \u0026#39must face criminal sanctions\u0026#39US Democrats rocked by anti-Semitism row as Muslim congresswoman apologisesBBC, Facebook and Google face new curbs on their power over news to safeguard quality journalismFamous and Fighting Crime, review: Penny Lancaster stole the show in this arresting reality seriesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/05/19/11/internet.jpg","title":"article 11 13 eu rules internet latest decision text passed copyright youtube google","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

It was an opportunity to reward homegrown talent, certainly, but the ceremony served\u0026nbspto put the\u0026nbsppieces into place ahead of the Oscars, which takes place in just two weeks.At this year’s Baftas,\u0026nbspThe Favourite\u0026nbspled the nominations with 12\u0026nbspleaving Alfonso Cuarón’s\u0026nbspRoma\u0026nbsptrailing behind with seven – not that having the numbers on your side is any guarantee of victory on the night. However, on this occasion, it did.Below are the evening\u0027s biggest talking points.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe Favourite ruled the night, despite Roma winning Best FilmThe Baftas had dual victors when it came to the ceremony. It was a night that belonged\u0026nbspto both Yorgos Lanthimos’s historical drama, which won seven awards, and Alfonso Cuarón’s Netflix-produced drama Roma, which won four awards.\u0026nbspThe Baftas 2019 winners list in full – updating liveThe Favourite may have a Greek director in\u0026nbspLanthimos, but the period piece received significant British funding, alongside being anchored by a British story (a love triangle between Queen Anne and two confidantes) and a largely UK-hailing cast, including Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz, who won Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively.\u0026nbspThe film not only won Outstanding British Film, but also won for Original Screenplay, Production Design and Make Up \u0026amp Hair. Roma, meanwhile, won the ultimate prize of the night, Best Film. Cuaron also won for Director, Cinematography and Film Not in the English Language.\u0026nbspJoanna Lumley played it (too) safeWhen Britain is currently facing one of the most turbulent political crises of recent history, it seems so faint-hearted of the ceremony to keep proceedings so… dry. Host Joanna Lumley’s monologue failed to deliver any topical gags, mostly consisting of a string of compliments and a cute joke about how The Favourite was, indeed, the night’s favourite. The only real jabs were saved for the Oscars and A Star is Born director Bradley Cooper. “Thank goodness Bafta has a host, though I suspect that has to do with the fact that I’m not on Twitter,” Lumley joked early on. Oscars organisers have confirmed that this year’s ceremony will have no official host for the first time in 30 years, after Kevin Hart stepped down when a number of old tweets resurfaced in which the comedian expressed homophobic views.Cooper, who is the star, director, producer, and screenwriter of A Star is Born, was declared by Lumley to be\u0026nbspa “multi-talented genius” who “needs to learn how to delegate”. While referencing Alfonso Cuarón’s nominations in six different categories, Lumley then turned to Cooper and added: “pull your finger out, sweetheart”.The speeches, too, were kept oddly short and free of political comment. Accepting the prize for Best Film, Cuarón\u0026nbspexpressed his gratitude for Roma winning during a time “when fear and anger would ide us” – perhaps he’s saving his most direct attacks on Trump’s policies for when he (very likely) wins at the upcoming Academy Awards. Andy Serkis made a quick reference while presenting the prize for Original Music, noting that: “Music is like Laurel without Hardy, Queen without Freddie Mercury - it\u0027s Britain without Europe”.\u0026nbspThe most controversial comment of the evening by far was made by presenter Eddie Marsan. While presenting the award for Best Costume Design with Cynthia Erivo, the actor described the difficulty of creating historically accurate costumes for films. He then added that it was particularly difficult to do since Britain had “reinvented its past to justify Brexit”. Perhaps the winners simply had no time, with such truncated speeches, to make their political case.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Baftas 2019: Best dressed guests on the red carpet Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The British actor looks chic in a white tuxedo by Stella McCartney on the red carpet.

Mahershala Ali beat Richard E Grant, the expected winner, to Best Supporting Actor, winning for his role as jazz musician Don Shirley in Green Book. Rami Malek, meanwhile, cemented himself as the favourite when it comes to the Academy Awards, winning Best Actor for his role as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. Thanking Dexter Fletcher, who stepped in as director when Bryan Singer was fired from the project, Malek said: “Thank you so much to Queen and to greatest outsider of them all, for being so unwavering and unflinching and uncompromising in every which way – thank you again, Freddie Mercury.”Letitia Wright proves the power of Marvel\u0026nbspLetitia Wright’s win for the publicly voted Rising Star Award proved that Marvel will always have its sway when it comes to the average cinemagoer. Although she’s proven herself time and time again in her performances – from Black Mirror to Young Vic’s staging of The Convert – it’s her role as Black Panther’s fan favourite character, inventor Shuri, that ultimately won her prize. In her speech, she said: “I identify myself as a child of God and I can’t get up here without thanking God. A few years ago, I saw myself in a deep state of depression and I literally wanted to quit acting.” She then credited God for helping her through this period, alongside an e-mail from Bafta asking her to take part in its Breakthrough Brits programme. “So this wasn’t an overnight thing. This wasn’t a click of the finger success. I’m still a work in progress,” she added. “I want to thank everybody that said yes to me.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The hunt for such alternatives inevitably leads to examples of other borders and it is usually only a matter of time before someone volunteers the Switzerland-France border as a model. Switzerland is in Schengen (so no need for passport checks) and regulations on goods are broadly aligned with those of the EU. Switzerland is not in the EU’s customs union nor its VAT regime, and that means border checks are required. Its watches and cuckoo clocks literally run like clockwork, so, the argument goes, must its borders.But it’s not as simple as that. As the Swiss Federal Customs Administration makes clear, even though they have the latest technology and much paperwork is done away from the border, there is still some physical infrastructure and delays of up to four hours if a lorry is searched.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn 2018 Switzerland launched a new IT-based customs transformation programme. This programme aims to simplify, harmonise and fully digitise customs tax and duty collection processes. It should be in place by 2026.However, this programme will not make controls at the border redundant. Quite the opposite. Because routine administrative work and bureaucratic procedures will be replaced by IT-based solutions, personnel will be freed up. These people will be used to strengthen security, especially for control functions and reinforcement of criminal prosecution. Some of these functions will continue to apply at the border. Hence, even with a highly technologically advanced customs management system, controls at the border will not become obsolete and nor will customs infrastructure vanish.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

Norway is not in the customs union either, so the origin of goods must be checked. Again, Norwegian Customs make clear what is required. Although it is technologically advanced, there is still a delay. The average time from when a lorry arrives at the border to when it leaves is about 20 minutes. This includes roughly ten minutes waiting time, three to six minutes of handling time, and the time spent coming off the road to complete the customs process. And there’s physical infrastructure too. All this despite existing agreements on customs facilitation, transit and rules of origin between the EU and the European Free Trade Association states, of which Norway is one.Less often talked about are Andorra and San Marino. Both are small European nations that are in a customs union with the EU. Although Andorra’s treaty only covers goods, its borders with Spain and France are strictly controlled. This is due to the fact that Andorra has no VAT (yet) and is known as low tax territory. Thus, smuggling has always been a concern of the neighbouring countries. The customs union with San Marino covers all goods except coal and steel. It has traditionally kept an open border without checks at its frontier with Italy. However, it levies an import tax, at 17 per cent.The Bulgaria-Turkey border is worse. Turkey is in a customs union with the EU, which removes tariffs and quantitative restrictions in bilateral trade between EU member states and Turkey for the goods covered. It also sets a single external tariff for both the EU and Turkey, so they charge the same duties on imports from non-EU countries.Unlike the customs union covering EU member states, the EU-Turkey agreement is incomplete. It covers industrial goods but not agricultural products (except certain processed agricultural products), coal and steel products, or public procurement.Finally, the border between Turkey and the EU is bureaucratic and lengthy. Lorry drivers need an export declaration, a customs permit, invoices for the products they are transporting, insurance certificates and a transport permit for each EU nation they will drive through. The queues at the border can be up to 17 kilometres long and the wait as much as 30 hours. While Turkey has invested significantly in modernising its border, with checks taking place an hour inland, Bulgarian officials check the paperwork for every truck and x-ray all refrigerated lorries.Which brings us to the US-Canada border. Again, much resource has been put into streamlining this border but there are still delays - the length can be seen online. All of this indicates that regardless of the technological capabilities of the EU’s neighbouring countries, there will be checks and the borders and this means infrastructure.By Professor Catherine Barnard, senior fellow The UK in a Changing Europe and Dr Georges Baur.

What began as a startup is now one of London’s leading destinations for yoga and\u0026nbsppilates, with five studios across the capital and more than 750 classes per week.Created with Sketch.Yoga Inc. The phenomenal popularity of yoga Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sattin had no initial plans to work in the wellbeing industry. “My father was a doctor and really wanted one of his three sons to follow in his footsteps,” he says.“For years, I thought that’s what I was going to do too. But I ended up going to law school and eventually became a lawyer, setting up my own practice when I was 27.”Looking for a better way to relax while studying, Sattin taught himself to meditate and the seeds for an altogether different life were sewn – not that he knew it at the time. In 1985, one of his colleagues who thought he was a little “left of centre” suggested he try yoga and sent Sattin to a private class in northwest London. The experience turned out to be life-changing.Sattin says: “It might sound clichéd but it’s one of these experiences that become more profound when you look back at them. At the time, I just realised instantly that I needed to change.“I was a heavy smoker, I used to smoke 40 cigarettes a day and a drink about 14 cups of coffee with two sugars each. Within three months of practising I quit all of that.” “It wasn’t that I suddenly gave up practising law, shaved my head and wore orange robes, but it was a catalyst for change. It encouraged me to do better.”After 18 years of practising law he decided he had enough in 1996. Sattin agreed to a year’s notice, which gave him time to think about his next steps. He says: “I was involved in the set up of Yo! Sushi and Protocol Multimedia Talent Agency. I was talking to some friends in Los Angeles, who said, ‘Why don’t you do what you love?’ and I realised yoga was what I was the most interested in.” He travelled to the US to see how studios like YogaWorks in Los Angeles and Jivamukti yoga in New York operated. “The aim was to see what they were doing wrong and what I could learn from their mistakes,” Sattin says.“Once I got the concept, I was very passionate about doing it and when you have that passion, people want you to succeed,” he adds.Sattin used his network to fund the company and managed to raise £500,000. In 2000, with the help of a company board, some of whose members he found while walking his golden retriever in Regent’s Park, the first Triyoga studio in Primrose Hill was born.Early investors included David Svendsen, who was then chair\u0026nbspof Microsoft, while Simon Low joined the company to be director of yoga, a role he kept until 2002.If you are a little shy about stepping inside this impressive mecca for yogis, you shouldn’t be. The whole concept was to create a place for all.Sattin says: “From the beginning, the idea was to create a place where anyone could practice yoga. It had to be authentic and we also wanted to have a wide range of classes. I knew from my own experience that people want different things at different times. The number of people who attend Triyoga classes each year“Sometimes you might want something dynamic and sometimes you might want something restorative. We wanted to help our customers to find the type of practice that was appropriate for them.” With its proximity to the London homes of Sadie Frost and Gwyneth Paltrow, who have both attended classes there, the Primrose Hill centre quickly become a byword for glamour – an image that Sattin is visibly uncomfortable with.He says: “When we first opened, our studio Primrose Hill wasn’t quite as cool and glamorous as it is now. It had the feeling of a village and it was quite awkward to get there. It was interesting as an area. We never sought to attract celebrities, our aim was to give time and space to practice to anyone that comes through our doors.”For the\u0026nbspfirst full year, the company’s turnover was £393,000, and in 2017 this jumped to an impressive £6.2m.\u0026nbspMore than 600,000 people attend Triyoga classes every year and in 2015 it opened a\u0026nbspteacher-training academy.A branch opened in Covent Garden in 2003, followed by Soho in 2005, and another two studios in Shoreditch and Ealing opened their doors in 2017.Of course, there were also some obstacles. Triyoga was forced out of its coveted location in Primrose Hill after losing a three-year battle against a development firm. Fortunately, Sattin promptly found an alternative venue in Camden in an old piano factory in Jamestown Road – a short walk away from its original location.Each studio now has a café and a shop. The company also offers teacher training, retreats and holidays. Sattin says: “As we’ve expanded, we’ve tried to get better, and improve our service and our offering. We always had changing rooms and showers – which was quite unusual at the time. But we’ve added cafés, shops and more treatments.“Essentially, we wanted our customers to have a comfy space where they wanted to stay and hangout. We wanted them to feel like they were part of something.” The market has changed considerably since Triyoga first opened its doors nearly 20 years ago. Competition might be more brutal than ever – but Sattin says the quality of the teaching at Triyoga is what makes them different from rivals.He says: “We are passionate with the quality of our teaching and our treatments. We now have 122 teachers, not including those who come for guest’s lessons.“We look at how qualified they are, but also if they teach the way that is right for us. As a basic rule our teachers need to have a minimum of five years’ experience. Each one goes through a thorough interview process and also teaches a class to the team and to our clients.”The company may not have embraced goat yoga, but it has been quick to evolve with the times – last year, Triyoga spearheaded an initiative for Consent Cards, the first of its kind, in response to the #MeToo movement. Sattin explains: “In yoga, some of our students may wish to be corrected, but others just prefer not to be touched. “These allow all students to put a card on their mat, so if they don’t want to be adjusted, the teacher knows without them having to say anything.”The company hosts a triyoga podcast, which Sattin says is all about confronting issues in the wellness world head-on. This include debates about yoga practices in a #MeToo era and the complex relationship between contemporary yoga and eating disorders.Perhaps it is down to the calming effect of yoga, but Sattin is refreshingly humble when talking about the centre’s success. When asked about oversea expansion plans, he says: “We don’t have plans to expand outside of the UK for now. I want to keep our values and continue investing in the right people, look at how we can improve our service and provide even better care for our clients.”A View from the TopOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, consumer confidence has started to come under pressure with British households £1,500 worse off on average than was forecast before the June 2016 vote to leave the EU.Households had been supplementing meagre earnings growth by increasing their levels of debt, but consumer credit growth dropped in December.The Bank of England reported\u0026nbspthe annual growth of unsecured lending in the month fell to 6.6 per cent, down from 7.2 per cent in November.This was the weakest figure since December 2014. Credit card lending growth slowed to 7.1 per cent, down from 7.9 per cent the previous month.A number of economists precisted the slowdown would continue into 2019 unless the government could deliver a degree of certainty about\u0026nbspthe UK’s trading relationship with the EU.Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said Brexit ucertainty and slowing global growth were “suffocating” economic\u0026nbspactivity.\u0026nbspHe added: “The continued decline in business investment is a blackspot for the economy as it undermines the UK’s ability to raise productivity and increase our long-term growth prospects.“It is increasingly likely that the slowdown at the end of 2018 will persist as continued Brexit uncertainty and the raised possibility of a no-deal exit from the EU weigh heavily on UK’s growth prospects. Firms are increasingly reporting having to ert staff, money and investment to protect against the chaos of a no-deal Brexit.”Paul Dales, chief UK economist\u0026nbspat Capital Economics, said the ONS figures support the more downbeat view given by the Bank of England last week.“But they also suggest there is plenty of scope for the economy to bounce back once the Brexit uncertainty is removed,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Come at me, says David BarnettClick to followThe IndependentOasis’s London debut at the Water Rats, January 1994There will be those who have just read the headline and already gone directly to the comments to take issue. For any waverers, I’ll set out my stall again: 1994 was the best year in music. Possibly ever.\u0026nbspStill here? Right, we happy few, let’s unpack this a little. Putting the words “best” and “music” together is always going to be subjective. One woman’s Metallica is another man’s Joe Dolce. And there’s also time and place to take into account. If you were six years old in 1994, you might not have been bothered about contemporary pop. If you were 76, maybe ditto. But there are certain immutable, irrefutable truths, and this is one of them. The year 1994 was spectacular for music on so, so many levels.Perhaps a bit of wider context is needed. To live through 1994 as a relatively young person (I turned 24 in the January) was to be at the centre of what felt like a time of transcendent change in the UK.That was the year the IRA ceasefire was signed, and 911 was still seven years away, and not on on our radar at all. After the breakup of the Soviet Union three years earlier, Russia was more interested in implementing democracy and capitalism than fighting a Cold War. It felt like the dawn of an age – sadly short-lived – when nobody was trying to blow us up.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn 1994, Bill Clinton was in the White House, and still a year away from staining his character (and a dress) by not having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. Neil Kinnock’s Labour had somehow lost the 1992 general election, despite everyone being confident the Tory stranglehold was finally over, but in 1994 Labour named Tony Blair as leader of the party, and things...\u0026nbspwell, things could only get better.To live through 1994 as a relatively young person ... was to be at the centre of what felt like a time of transcendent change in the UKAfter what seemed like years of stagnation, there was a whiff of change in the air. Things felt in some way more optimistic. The country felt more inclusive, less isive. There was opportunity, and expectation. It was the year they launched the National Lottery. Any one of us could become a multimillionaire by buying a ticket for a quid.And music reflected this, as it always reflects the world around it. There was a sensation of rapid, almost out-of-control evolution in music. People’s record collections became more eclectic, more wide-ranging, more small-c catholic. The old boundaries seemed to melt away. You didn’t need to choose between being a rocker or a raver or an indie-kid or a popster. You could be all of them at once, because if the bands and artists were refusing to stay in their pigeonholes, why should the public?Why we haven’t had a decent Christmas song since 1994Slap bang in the middle of the year, at the Glastonbury Festival at the end of June, I stood in a field and had a transformative experience watching the progressive techno band Orbital playing a set to what felt like half the people in the world. They had come to Glastonbury to see Oasis, or Rage Against the Machine they had come for Björk and James. They had come to listen to Nick Cave, to jump around to Blur, to dance to M People. And in the end, they all came to watch Orbital playing their bleepy, unnerving, bass-pounding music of the spheres, and for what felt like the first time ever the tribes were all united in the love of music.Of course, that could just be the drugs talking. But look at that Glastonbury line-up! Just one year, one scorching hot June weekend! And you can add to that list St Etienne, Paul Weller, Pulp, Spirtualised, Radiohead...\u0026nbsppossibly the best Glastonbury ever, in the year of the best music ever?That coming together at the Orbital set heralded a sea change for Glastonbury. According to Sheryl Garratt’s excellent book detailing the rise of rave culture, Adventures in Wonderland, Glasto organiser Michael Eavis had previously shied away from having a dance stage because of the negative connotations attached to rave and techno – primarily the drugs, illegal events and mass takeovers at places like Castlemorton two years previously.She wrote: “But after Orbital’s live set stole the show in 1994, a dance stage and dance tents were finally introduced the following year, and Glastonbury has become an annual event on the club calendar.”If I had to fight with myself over this bold claim for 1994 to be music’s finest year, I’d probably employ maybe 1988 as my weapon of choice. That was really the start of rave culture, and where dance music began to cross over with guitar bands, resulting in the baggy Madchester sound epitomised by the Happy Mondays, the Stone Roses, James and\u0026nbspthe Inspiral Carpets.But while that might have been where the seeds of fusion of the genres and inclusivity were sown, I’d argue that it wasn’t until 1994 that those ideas and concepts properly blossomed. And, of course, 1994 was the year of Britpop.It was actually in 1993 that Britpop got going, thanks to a feature in the now defunct music magazine Select. Grunge, with its poster boys Nirvana and their lead singer Kurt Cobain (more of whom anon) had held sway with its nihilistic, fuzzy guitars in Britain for a couple of years among an army of plaid-wearing, chain-smoking disaffected youth. But Select wanted to wave the flag for Blighty, quite literally as that month’s issue featured on its cover Suede’s Brett Anderson against a union jack background and an article\u0026nbspinside headlined, “Who Do You Think You Are Kidding, Mr Cobain?”. Denim, Pulp, Suede, The Auteurs and St Etienne were all featured, in a bid to push British pop back up the agenda.By 1994, two seminal Britpop albums went head to head – as did the bands responsible for them. Oasis released their debut Definitely Maybe, while Blur brought out their third LP, Parklife. Oasis v Blur bubbled under throughout the year, battle lines drawn at the Watford Gap. It was the naughty north vs the sexy south, Manchester’s Oasis and their Beatlesque anthems set against Blur’s cheeky chappy Camden Kinks roisterers. By the following year, the so-called rivalry even made the BBC evening news as the two bands released singles on the same day.If there ever was any proper animosity between Oasis and Blur, it didn’t extend to the fans. Blur or Oasis might have been a perennial pub debate throughout 1994, but I don’t think I knew anyone who didn’t own both Definitely Maybe and Parklife. The rivalry added a bit of spice, and music fans were the winners with two defining albums of the decade.Britpop wasn’t only about Blur and Oasis, of course, though as the cocky lads in the class they tended to get most of the attention. But let us consider some of the other releases that came under the red-white-and-blue Britpop banner:\u0026nbspPulp’s His ’n’\u0026nbspHers, considered to be the album that brought them to mainstream attention, especially for the standout tracks “Do You Remember the First Time?” and “Babies”\u0026nbspEchobelly’s debut Everyone’s Got One, with its spiky, caustic, feminist songs Suede’s second album Dog Man Star, which perhaps exemplified how bands were not afraid to evolve and transform in 1994. Suede’s first album was almost a paean to Bowie with a side order of The Smiths here they’d gone much more personal and perhaps introspective.Another band that completely reinvented itself in 1994 was Primal Scream. Never a band to stick with one musical style, they had, however, found a niche in the dance-rock mash-ups of 1991’s Screamadelica. When they returned in ’94 with Give Out But Don’t Give Up, it could not have been further from the blissed-out rhythms of “Loaded” and “Higher Than the Sun”. The Scream had gone full-on Rolling Stones blues, and the\u0026nbspfirst single from the album, “Rocks”, was the band’s highest-charting release.Had 1994 given us only Britpop, the year would still have deserved a place in posterity. But it was about so much more than that. Select magazine might have jokingly tried to drive America back into the sea the previous year, but US bands released some absolutely classic albums that year.What about Green Day’s Dookie, and its single “Basket Case”? By 1994, REM were stone-cold alt-rock royalty, and while their ninth studio album Monster might not be in everyone’s top five REM albums, it did at least give us the single “What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?”. Weezer released their self-titled debut, and Beck gave us the unalloyed eclectic joy of Mellow Gold and the single “Loser”.But the most influential American band of the era, Nirvana, came to a tragic end when, in April,\u0026nbspleader Kurt Cobain wrote a note to his imaginary childhood friend and then put a shotgun to his chin and pulled the trigger. He had gone and joined that stupid club, the one where the most talented musicians of a generation end their own lives at the age of 27. Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison. The year\u0026nbsphad its martyr.This was also the year that music fans who’d previously filled their CD racks with white boys playing guitars began to embrace rap and hip-hop\u0026nbsp– and also when hip-hop transformed, Kafka-like, into something quite new.Then Notorious BIG\u0026nbspreleased his debut Ready to Die, and indeed he did, becoming the martyr of 1997 a few years later. Public Enemy brought out their highly acclaimed fifth studio album, Muse Sick-n-Hour Mess Age, and the Beastie Boys fused hip hop with the greatest 1970s police detective show that never was with the video to their single “Sabotage”.In Britain, this acceptance of rap into the music collections of the largely white indie-kid audience led to the birth of something else we can thank 1994 for: trip-hop.The term was coined that year by a Mixmag journalist to describe the bass-heavy fusion of hip-hop and dance music that was largely coming out of Bristol. Massive Attack had already released the seminal Blue Lines album and the evergreen “Unfinished Sympathy” in 1991, but this year saw their second album Protection, and its standout single release “Karmacoma”. But the year was most notable for Portishead’s debut, Dummy, drenched in blue and heartbreak, and the soundtrack to a thousand all-back-to-mine post-club chillouts.What else? Well, we could still get away with forgiving Morrissey a lot back in 1994, especially with his fourth solo album Vauxhall and I. The Manic Street Preachers released The Holy Bible, the last work to feature troubled lyricist and guitarist Richey Edwards. The following year he would go missing, never to be found, making a martyr of a more introspective kind than Cobain’s dramatic exit. The old-stagers were keeping on keeping on, with albums from Madonna and the Rolling Stones, and even a wealth of previously unheard Beatles material from their sessions at the BBC.But if there was one comeback that exemplified 1994, it had to be The Stone Roses. Their self-titled debut album in 1989 soundtracked a generation. Their return five years later had a lot riding on it in terms of expectations. So, of course, they titled it The Second Coming.Bill Gates basically predicted rise of Netflix and Facebook in 1994Read this full unedited Tom Petty interview published in 1994Was it ever going to be as good as The Stone Roses? No, of course not, because that album was perfection. But with singles such as “Love Spreads” and “Ten Storey Love Song”, they made a pretty good fist of it. But it was an event, it was exciting, it was history-making. And it was brave and reckless and so typically Stone Roses\u0026nbspto release their first new album for years when everyone had all but written them off, and especially to do that in the greatest year for music ever.Without the benefit of the internet or smartphones, we discovered new music in 1994, we heard it in the pubs and at gigs and in clubs and festivals and on John Peel’s radio show. We bought indie music then we went to Creamfields or to superclubs in places like Leeds, and danced until dawn.Techno got hard and heavy. The aforementioned Orbital released Snivilisation, a growling, science-fiction nightmare of an album. The government tried to kill off rave culture good and proper with the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which drove people into the clubs but also earned a response from the Prodigy in the form of Music for the Jilted Generation, a howling, psychopathic protest album that gifted us the insane energy of “No Good (Start the Dance)” and “Voodoo People”. The Chemical Brothers, under the name the Dust Brothers, started releasing singles. Dance music became raw and scary, a self-fulfilling prophecy for those in positions of authority that thought they simply had to ban it.Music in 1994 was a erse mess, just like it always is. But it seemed as if there was an invisible thread running through all these genres\u0026nbspthat connected people through a general love of music. You might love Oasis more than the Prodigy, or Blur more than Portishead, but the chances are you listened to all of it. The year was about invention, about reinvention, about throwing open the doors and just trying everything. It was involving and inclusive and seems to shine so very brightly from the vantage point of today.\u0026nbspThe obvious answer to all this is that I am just old and clinging on to a year that seemed glorious just because I was there. But I insist: 1994 was the best year ever for music, and its spirit is something we could sorely do with today.

It opposes the extremism of no-deal but is not prepared to support ‘no Brexit’. Its position is for soft Brexit, triangulating between the instruction to Leave and the economic concerns of those who voted to Remain.That means a permanent customs union, alignment with the single market, and compromise on freedom of movement. Jeremy Corbyn’s letter to the prime minister of 6th February set out Labour’s Brexit plan clearly and coherently. What is distinctive about Labour’s plan for Brexit is that it honours the vote to leave while maintaining a close partnership with the EU such that it is capable of securing the consent of those who voted to stay. It has more than fulfilled its responsibility as the Opposition. \u0026nbspThe Labour plan appears to be based on the IPPR paper ‘the Shared Market’, first published in December 2017, which I co-authored. In fact, its first outing was not to the Labour leadership but to David Davis and Steve Baker at the Department for Exiting the European Union.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe report introduced the idea that the crucial strategic decision was not about securing ‘access’ to the single market but rather whether there would be regulatory alignment or regulatory ergence. The report examined the various options for a new partnership, identifying a future relationship that could satisfy the concerns of both sides of the ide (and was briefly considered by senior cabinet figures).Labour’s position has, in fact, been much more defined for longer than is commonly imagined.It was in February last year that the Labour Leader adopted the central idea of “a new and comprehensive customs union” that would be permanent. A few months later a frontbench Labour amendment adopted another key component: alignment to the single market, based on shared institutions, such as a UK Court of Justice with multilateral membership.The Corbyn letter codified other elements too, including dynamic alignment on workers’ and consumer rights and environmental protections (meaning that regulations would adjust in the UK to match improvements in the single market over time). Mindful of the sovereignty concerns of Leave supporters, the report also argued that there must remain the possibility of ergence, albeit with known and proportionate consequences thus eliminating any ‘cakeism’.The Labour plan was infused with political life by positive reactions in Westminster and Brussels. The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said it could be a way to break the impasse. Senior Conservative backbenchers said that they would support key elements of the proposal.So we now know that there is a deal available that is acceptable to the EU and that could almost certainly command majority support in the House of Commons. But its passage would come at the price of splitting the Tory Party down the middle, on a scale and severity akin to the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 (another dispute about international trade).Yet Mrs May has chosen to reject Labour’s proposal, placing the unity of the Conservative Party above the opportunity to unify the country with a form of Brexit that would have honoured the referendum result while protecting the economy.Labour strategists believe that attempting to stop Brexit would destroy the party’s chances of winning the next general election. They point out that the vast majority of Labour-Tory marginals voted to Leave, and that it is vital for the party to win these seats if it is to create an anti-Tory majority in the House of Commons. They believe that these voters would punish them for advocating for, let alone forcing, a second referendum. Some go further still, arguing that Labour would inevitably lead the Remain campaign\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspand that Leave would win once again, thus destroying the leadership of\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn.\u0026nbspThose representing working class constituencies in the north of England have vocally made the case that attempting to reverse Brexit would be a betrayal of Labour’s working class supporters. The reality is that for many of Labour’s working class supporters, Brexit is not particularly important, compared to the impact of austerity and stagnating living standards. This makes sense: any voter for whom leaving the EU was a top issue would be unlikely to support Labour anyhow.Nonetheless, the nostalgic, romantic idea of championing the working classes has strong emotional resonance at the top of the party. Shadow ministers such as Ian Lavery, Richard Burgon, Jon Trickett, and Andrew Gwynne are reported to have threatened to resign rather than to vote in favour of a second referendum. So for the Labour leadership so far, a second referendum has been a paper option, not a serious way forward.Moreover, this electoral strategy chimes with the long-held ideological position of key decision makers, many of whom have been opposed to the EU for decades. It is variously seen as an undemocratic, neoliberal institution, asserting neo-colonial control over its weaker members, and as an instrument of NATO. That’s why Jeremy Corbyn opposes Tory Brexit, but does not oppose Brexit itself.From this standpoint, accepting the result of the referendum is not sacrificing the national interest to the party interest they are inisible. Confirmation bias is surely at play: the electoral strategy that is seen as most promising is also the one that confirms the pre-existing ideological position.Created with Sketch.

This was illustrated by the absence of consequences for those Labour MPs that rebelled on the Cooper-Boles amendment to legislate to prevent no-deal.This strategy stands a reasonable chance of success: the real die-hards in the Conservative Party that oppose any deal number perhaps 30 MPs should roughly 15 Labour MPs support the government and roughly 30 abstain, then the deal will pass. But is this really smart politics? Or a high stakes gamble based on flawed assumptions?First, the strategy is based on the assumption that British politics will ‘move on’ from Brexit after the deal is approved by parliament and refocus on domestic policy instead. Labour wisely realises that politics is not about two competing answers to the same question but what question is being answered in the first place: if Brexit is the question of a general election, then the Tories will be the answer.But if the election is about the state of the country, Labour believes it is poised to win. At the 2017 general election, many voters appeared to think that Brexit and immigration had been ‘dealt with’ and the national conversation shifted to stagnant wages, increasing class sizes and longer waiting times in the NHS.In the Brexit poker game no one has a decent handBut this is wishful thinking. Brexit won’t disappear as a political issue: come the end of 2020, parliament will need to either ratify a FTA with the EU, extend the transition at the cost of £11byear, or enter the hated backstop. The most likely outcome is a transition that extend to April 2022, the month prior to the general election in May 2022. That feels like an eternity away—and in political terms it is. If the Brexit project succeeds—or more accurately, it does not catastrophically fail—the government will reap the political benefits. But if it fails, expect the blame to be spread liberally around. Neither is it wise to assume opinion will remain static. The longer the Brexit shambles persists, the higher the chance that Labour votes shift from disquiet to disillusion with their leader’s seeming ambivalence. \u0026nbspSecond, the strategy assumes that the next general election will be determined by swing voters in marginal seats. This approach privileges the views of Labour and Tory Leave supporters rather than Remainers. But it is hard to picture Tory-voting Leave supporters switching to Labour under Corbyn’s leadership, not least because these voters are more likely to be concerned about issues such as national security which are traditional ‘owned’ by the Conservatives. It is hard to believe that the same people who can energise the left with a clear socialist message can also persuade Brexit supporting Tory voters to switch allegiances. More than that, as New Labour discovered to its peril, it is dangerous to take your own supporters for granted.But what if the election isn’t determined by swing voters at all?One of the important consequences of the 2016 referendum was to ide the country in two blocs that have coalesced into competing identities as well as political positions. Is the UK perhaps becoming a 50-50 nation? This is the phenomenon seen in the US since the 1990s – where the country is split into two competing cultural and geographic blocs – and may provide some explanation for the resurgence in support for the two major parties in the 2017 general election.In such a scenario, what matters is not swing voters but energising your base to get out and vote – and not sufficiently riling your opponents’ supporters so they feel the need to stop you (witness Labour’s commitment to the pensions triple lock in 2017, for example).\u0026nbspLabour strategists have argued that Remainers have nowhere else to go, and that if there was really popular support for a stop Brexit party, then the Liberal Democrats would have been beneficiaries by now. The mooted “Neoliberal Democrat”\u0026nbspparty that is likely to be formed by a small number of Labour MPs splitting to join with the Lib Dems will attract copious media coverage, but has next to no constituency in the country.But this is to miss the point: the real risk for Labour is not that its Remain voters support other parties, but that they simply stay at home and don’t vote for anyone. So if the next general election is determined by turnout rather than by swing voters, Labour could be in serious trouble. Labour is betting that these voters are to be found in city seats with already large majorities, and so the impact would be negligible. But what if they are in marginals, in places like Kensington or Canterbury?Team Corbyn believe that their base is not energised by EU membership, but by ending austerity, investing in public services, and promoting economic justice. That is certainly true for vocal Labour supporters for whom the project is about socialism, not the details of the UK’s relationship with the single market or European institutions.Brexit: How austerity convinced residents to vote LeaveBut for other middle-class voters – insulated from the severest impacts of austerity but for whom the EU is an important identity issue – there is a risk that this is not the case. And Labour’s ask to the middle classes for more redistribution means that motivation really matters in getting them out to vote. Labour may discover\u0026nbspvoters find it rather easy to stay at home when asked to vote for higher taxes on themselves. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThird, Labour’s triangulated position risks undermining one of the most important dimensions of Corbyn’s popular appeal. Despite being in parliament for more than 30 years, Corbyn was able to position Labour as the party of change precisely because he was rightly perceived to be an outsider, and unlike career politicians. The message of his leadership campaign – “straight talking, honest politics” – was the same positioning used in the 2017 general election.But by triangulating on Brexit, Corbyn runs the risk of being seen to be just like any other politician. This probably explains the decline in his approval ratings to historic lows—indeed, Corbyn might be better perceived if he simply picked a side, whether that was Leave or Remain.The shift in perception of Corbyn towards being seen as any other politician will make it much harder for Labour to be seen as the party that can bring about the change Britain needs at the next general election, particularly since the Tories will have elected a new leader by that time. Again, this risks turnout of Labour voters rather than affecting swing voters. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat’s the alternative?The only way out our Brexit malaise? Labour winning a general electionThe alternative for Labour is to stick to the spirit as well as the letter of its Brexit policy agreed at its party conference in September. That would mean continuing to oppose May’s Brexit deal as bad for the country and for no-deal to be taken off the table. If Labour’s Brexit plan is rejected by parliament, then the party should fight for the people to be given the final say. \u0026nbspIt must mobilise its 500,000 members to campaign for the people to be given the final say on the deal—whether to keep the deal we already have as members (in the EU but out of the euro and Schengen) or to embrace the deal proposed by the prime minister. If the prime minister believes so strongly in her deal, why not put it to the people?If Labour MPs are presented with a choice between May’s Withdrawal Agreement—including its hard Brexit destination for the future relationship—and a no-deal Brexit, the prime minister will win the vote. The prime minister knows this and the public do too.As it stands, Labour is already seen by a majority of the public as the “party of Remain”. Brexit was always a project of the right and it is now rightly owned by the Tory party. Given this, voters might well reward the party for a clear, forceful, and unambiguous position – regardless of whether the parliamentary numbers for a further referendum materialise or not. Labour does not have the votes in parliament to end austerity, but that has not stopped it from campaigning against it. Why should Brexit be different? A public vote can only happen if it commands cross-party support, so if Labour is unable to force it to happen, it will not shoulder the responsibility. But if it doesn’t even try, then it will surely share in the public’s opprobrium.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentIn many respects, Labour is in the classic dilemma of strategy under uncertainty. For all the claims and counterclaims of each side, the truth is that no one can be sure, not least because Labour possesses the capacity to shape events as well as respond to them. The polling evidence is mixed and often contradictory—a majority of the public don’t want a second referendum but then again Labour support also appears to suffer significantly if the party is seen to back Brexit.No one should pretend Labour faces an easy path ahead. But situations of extreme uncertainty also have their blessings: if the politically shrewd course is unclear, then all the more reason to simply do the right thing for the future prosperity and security of the country, and oppose Brexit. \u0026nbspLeaving the EU is bad for Britain it is a project of the radical right that has been revealed to have been both deceitful and empty at the same time. Labour should oppose it.Centuries of foreign policy sought to prevent the European continent uniting against this country through our own volition, the UK has finally brought about precisely the outcome it has always sought to avoid.Since its creation, the United Kingdom has been torn between wishing to engage in European affairs and to retreat to its shores, and Brexit must be understood in that context. So it is a very serious mistake to believe that there can be political stability outside the EU: no equilibrium position can be reached precisely because the UK economy will continue to be shaped by decisions made in Brussels. No matter the deal, Brexit means the UK giving up its participation in decision-making and losing the very control the referendum sought to restore.That’s why, in time, the UK will re-join, albeit on less favourable terms than we enjoy today. And so the left of British politics will surely search for internationalist leadership in the decade ahead. No matter how much the public demand “just get on with it”, the Europe question is here to stay.\u0026nbspLabour must fight for Britain to shape our future for the better, as full members of the European Union.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTom Kibasi writes in a personal capacity.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The hat is believed to have been added overnight, with passers-by stopping to take photos in the early hours of the morning. The Sir Antony Gormley sculpture was installed in 1998, with celebrations marking its 20th birthday this yearWe\u0027re planning a full evaluation of the partnerships later this year. Like the review, we believe in strong local journalism and have been looking at how best to develop the work we have begun with the industry and will have more to say in the near future, a spokesperson said.However, there is no evidence of the BBC crowding out other providers. This was looked at extensively during Charter review. It\u0027s vital that people of all ages have access to impartial news which is relevant to them, and we provide younger audiences with a wide range of stories.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re happy to look at what more we can do to share our technical and digital expertise for the benefit of local publishers, but as the review itself says, any curtailing of the BBC\u0027s news offer would be counter-productive.Representing national, regional and local news organisations, the News Media Association (NMA) said it wanted to work with ministers to take forward the recommendations of the review as a matter of urgency.This is a thoughtful report which recognises the critical role of written journalism to democracy and sets out a series of detailed recommendations, many of which respond directly to the proposals put forward by the NMA and our members, it said in a statement.These include a Competition and Markets Authority market study into the \u0027complex and opaque\u0027 online advertising market, new measures aimed at constraining the behaviour of the online platforms, an examination of the BBC\u0027s impact on commercial publishers, funding support for local news publishers, and tax reliefs such as extending VAT zero rating for online news publications.We look forward to engaging with the government to discuss the Cairncross recommendations in more detail and how these should be taken forward as a matter of urgency to ensure they support independent journalism delivered by a strong and sustainable press.The Society of Editors (SoE) welcomed the review\u0027s support for the reporting of local democracy –\u0026nbspincluding the expansion of the BBC local news partnerships –\u0026nbspbut said it was essential the press remained free from political interference.It is extremely gratifying that Dame Frances and her panel have underscored the need to protect and indeed reinvigorate the reporting of local democracy and open justice, areas which have suffered and continue to suffer as the industry contracts, its executive director, Ian Murray, said.Crucial to all of the recommendations for what is really state support for the local media industry in particular, are the report\u0027s insistence that bodies such as the proposed institution are free from political and other interference in deciding what constitutes public interest news worth supporting.”Additional reporting from agencies\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You can’t really run in it, it’ll literally fly off. The pins come out and it falls off – it’s not comfortable.“Wearing the sports hijab makes it ten times easier, and I genuinely think it’s a lifesaver.”Some sports giants already have their own hijabs on the market, however at £15 Brunel’s is about 40 per cent cheaper than the one Nike launched in 2017.The hijab will initially only be available in “Brunel blue” and in two sizes but it is hoped there will be a wider range of colours if it takes off.Scrap GCSEs and focus on skills for ‘digital age’, senior MP saysSheffield student investigated after offensive messages about womenMinisters reject calls to ease ‘pointlessly cruel’ benefit sanctionsTurkey calls on China to close Muslim \u0027concentration camps\u0027 Ranjeet Rathore, president of the Union of Brunel Students, has been a driving force behind the hijab.“When we narrowed it down, we found the main gap to be in BAME female sports participation – specifically, we found there to be a barrier to Muslim women taking part in team sport,” he said.“Of course, they were participating in sports on their own and in private, but they weren’t really going out to competitions, or using sport as a social tool to get involved in activities.“There are now other unis that want to partner with us, who want to take samples off us, who want to do their own hijab – which is great news.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brussels\u0026nbsphas insisted that\u0026nbspit will not reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspmeaning no changes to the controversial Irish\u0026nbspbackstop.On Tuesday, Ms May will have to ask MPs for more time to secure the changes she is seeking.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe\u0026nbspfurther delay has renewed speculation that this is a deliberate ploy, with Labour accusing the prime minister of “cynically” running down the clock.Some opponents claim that her strategy is to waste time and then\u0026nbspforce MPs to vote on her deal when it is too late to find any alternative.Move your Brexit red lines, Labour and EU both tell Theresa MayIn theory she could return to the Commons late in March –\u0026nbspjust days before the 29 March exit date –\u0026nbspand claim parliament has only two choices: back her deal\u0026nbspor leave the EU without an agreement.\u0026nbspMs May\u0026nbsphas already pushed back key votes on her Brexit deal, fuelling claims\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspshe is playing for time.First she delayed the “meaningful vote” on her\u0026nbspwithdrawal agreement\u0026nbspby more than\u0026nbspa month. Originally due to take place on 11 December, it was eventually held on 15 January.When the deal was rejected by an unprecedented\u0026nbsp230 votes, many people expected the prime minister to change strategy and pivot towards a softer Brexit, a no-deal outcome or some form of public vote.That has not happened. Instead, she\u0026nbsphas insisted she can secure the concessions from the EU that she believes she needs\u0026nbspto win parliament’s support for her deal, despite Brussels giving no indication\u0026nbspthat it is willing to budge.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentMore delays seem to be on the horizon. Last month, Ms May promised that she would either give MPs a vote on a revised deal\u0026nbspby 13 February or, if she had not been able to secure further changes, on an amendable motion updating the Commons on her negotiations.With no alternative deal\u0026nbspin sight, MPs will only\u0026nbspvote this week on the government’s update,\u0026nbspwhich is likely to say that more time is needed\u0026nbspto secure changes to the agreement.Ministers have floated\u0026nbspthe prospect of a similar vote being held on 27\u0026nbspFebruary, meaning a second vote on the deal itself\u0026nbspis unlikely to happen before the end of February at the earliest. Even if a deal is then approved, it would leave just a month for parliament to pass all the legislation needed to enact Brexit.Video shows Jeremy Corbyn vowing to ‘defeat’ the EUFood industry threatens to end cooperation over no-deal riskCorbyn ‘cut second referendum line from letter to May’‘Take a breath’ and admit UK not ready for Brexit, Tory MPs tell MayAn EU summit scheduled for 22 March –\u0026nbspless than a week before Brexit day –\u0026nbspcould give Ms May justification for further delays, if she argues that this is when the EU will finally offer new concessions.\u0026nbspEven if no concessions were forthcoming, some people\u0026nbspbelieve that, faced with the threat of a no-deal Brexit in a matter of days, MPs would reluctantly\u0026nbspagree to support the prime minister’s plan (even if it is fundamentally unchanged from the one rejected in January).\u0026nbspBut any strategy involving running down the clock is highly risky, not least because it\u0026nbsprelies on parliament agreeing not to intervene in the coming weeks. Last month, Labour’s Yvette Cooper tabled an amendment that would have delayed Brexit until the end of the year if no deal was in place by the end of February.That motion was rejected by a margin of 23 votes, but as Brexit edges closer and the prospect of no deal becomes ever more likely, MPs might be swayed into backing another, similar\u0026nbspamendment.\u0026nbspThe Labour leadership is also seeking to torpedo Ms May’s ability to waste time. Jeremy Corbyn has written to the prime minister offering talks on a cross-party compromise deal, and will this week table an amendment that would force her to hold a second vote on her Brexit deal –\u0026nbsprevised or not –\u0026nbspby 26 February.No one other than Ms May and her closest advisers knows whether\u0026nbspshe is deliberately running down the clock.\u0026nbspBut the continual delays and her refusal to consider an extension to Article 50 do little to quash claims that this is her plan.Even if it is\u0026nbspnot, the fact remains that the 29 March Brexit date is enshrined in law and the UK is speeding towards it without a deal in sight.

He will have dinner with Mr Barnier and try to convince him of the need for changes to the Irish backstop – which the EU has flat-out refused to countenance.But Mr Barnier said: “Tonight I will repeat the EU’s positions. I will listen to what the secretary of state has to tell us concerning the alternative arrangements which the UK would like“But it’s not more than a concept today. I will also evaluate the interest from the UK side for possible changes to the political declaration, which, let me remind you, fixes the outline quite precisely for the future separation.”David Lidington, Ms May’s Cabinet Brexit fixer, is also in the EU capital for meetings, and he and Mr Barclay will go to Strasbourg on Tuesday for meetings with MEPs.Speaking ahead of a meeting with the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney on Monday, Mr Starmer told reporters: “We will have to see what happens next, but the point of the exercise is to say there is a majority for a close economic relationship if you are prepared to try to find it, and I said we should test that by having a vote on the customs union.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliament“The Labour Party has some concerns about the backstop but we absolutely accept that it’s inevitable that we need a backstop. At this stage of the exercise the Article 50 window is almost being closed now so we need a backstop.“The letter was an agreed letter that was sent out. The critical question is: is she, in her response, indicating a willingness to drop her red lines or not? And that’s what needs to be tested sooner rather than later.”Following the meeting between Mr Barclay and Mr Barnier, a UK government spokesperson said: “Secretary of State for the Department for Exiting the European Union Stephen Barclay and Michel Barnier followed up on last week\u0027s meeting between the Prime Minister and President of the European Commission Juncker to discuss the next steps in the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and explore whether a way through can be found that would be acceptable to the UK Parliament and to the European Union.\u0026nbspThe meeting was constructive and Mr Barclay and Mr Barnier agreed to further talks in the coming days and that their teams would continue to work in the meantime on finding a way forward.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

“pushing the UK” into the risk of a crash-out Brexit, by failing to compromise on the backstop controversy.“It would be an extraordinary outcome if the thing the backstop is seeking to avoid – which is a hard border in Northern Ireland – if the EU were so determined to be completely intransigent that they actually incur the very thing they are seeking to avoid,” the Commons leader said.Created

Thursday, a fresh round of Brexit votes will take place, but with little expectation of any amendment passing that will put parliament “in control”.There is no sign of pro-EU cabinet ministers

However, consumer confidence has started to come under pressure with British households £1,500 worse off on average than was forecast before the June 2016 vote to leave the EU.Households had been supplementing meagre earnings growth by increasing their levels of debt, but consumer credit growth dropped in December.The Bank of England reported\u0026nbspthe annual growth of unsecured lending in the month fell to 6.6 per cent, down from 7.2 per cent in November.This was the weakest figure since December 2014. Credit card lending growth slowed to 7.1 per cent, down from 7.9 per cent the previous month.A number of economists precisted the slowdown would continue into 2019 unless the government could deliver a degree of certainty about\u0026nbspthe UK’s trading relationship with the EU.Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said Brexit ucertainty and slowing global growth were “suffocating” economic\u0026nbspactivity.\u0026nbspHe added: “The continued decline in business investment is a blackspot for the economy as it undermines the UK’s ability to raise productivity and increase our long-term growth prospects.“It is increasingly likely that the slowdown at the end of 2018 will persist as continued Brexit uncertainty and the raised possibility of a no-deal exit from the EU weigh heavily on UK’s growth prospects. Firms are increasingly reporting having to ert staff, money and investment to protect against the chaos of a no-deal Brexit.”Paul Dales, chief UK economist\u0026nbspat Capital Economics, said the ONS figures support the more downbeat view given by the Bank of England last week.“But they also suggest there is plenty of scope for the economy to bounce back once the Brexit uncertainty is removed,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As such, they show that the round object isn\u0027t so round at all – when looked at from another view, it is almost flat, which scientists did not expect.After the first images, scientists nicknamed Ultima Thule the snowman, because it seemed to resembles two spheres stacked on top of each other.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

In part, that is because they have revealed the outline of part of the object that was initially not visible because it was not lit by the Sun – but could be seen by tracing out the background stars that it had blocked out.New Nasa images reveal ‘highly unusual’ shape of Ultima ThuleInstead of being a snowman, the two sections are not spherical at all. The bigger part is like a giant pancake and the smaller one is like a dented walnut, the scientists say.We had an impression of Ultima Thule based on the limited number of images returned in the days around the flyby, but seeing more data has significantly changed our view, Stern said. It would be closer to reality to say Ultima Thule\u0027s shape is flatter, like a pancake. But more importantly, the new images are creating scientific puzzles about how such an object could even be formed. We\u0027ve never seen something like this orbiting the Sun.The images aren\u0027t the last to be captured or sent by New Horizons, which began its work on Ultima Thule after exploring Pluto. But they are the last views thatit captured as it raced away after its New Years flyby, travelling past at 31,000 miles per hour.The images were snapped just 10 minutes after New Horizons passed by its closest approach to the distant object.This really is an incredible image sequence, taken by a spacecraft exploring a small world four billion miles away from Earth, said Stern. Nothing quite like this has ever been captured in imagery.Much of the scientific data being collected is being used to understand how small planets might have formed in the early solar system. But the shocking and strange shape of Ultima Thule could change that understanding fundamentally, scientists say.While the very nature of a fast flyby in some ways limits how well we can determine the true shape of Ultima Thule, the new results clearly show that Ultima and Thule are much flatter than originally believed, and much flatter than expected, added Hal Weaver, New Horizons project scientist from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. This will undoubtedly motivate new theories of planetesimal formation in the early solar system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Among the many rules are a working week of a maximum 48 hours, including overtime, a daily rest period of 11 hours in every 24, a break if a person works for six hours or more, and one day off in every seven. It also includes provisions for paid annual leave of at least four weeks every year25 Helping the people of Britain to avoid smokingIn 2014 MEPs passed the Tobacco Products Directive strengthening existing rules on the manufacture, production and presentation of tobacco products. This includes things like reduced branding, restrictions on products containing flavoured tobacco, health warnings on cigarette packets and provisions for e-cigarettes to ensure they are safe35 Helping you to make the right choices with your foodThanks to the European Parliament, UK consumers have access to more information than ever about their food and drink. This includes amount of fat, and how much of it is saturated, carbohydrates, sugars, protein and so on. It also includes portion sizes and guideline daily amount information so people can make informed choices about their diet. All facts must be clear and easy to understand45 Two year guarantees and 14-day returns policy for all productsConsumers across the EU have access to a number of rights, from things which are potentially very useful, to things which used to be annoying. For example, shoppers in the UK receive a two-year guarantee on all products, and a 14-day period to change their minds and return a purchase, these things are useful55 Keeping your air nice and fresh (and safe)Believe it or not, although the situation is improving, some areas of the UK have appalling air quality. A report by the Royal College of Physicians released on 23 February says 40,000 deaths are caused by outdoor air pollution in the UK every year. Air pollution is linked to a number of illnesses and conditions, from Asthma to diabetes and dementia. The report estimates  the costs to British business and the health service add up to £20 billion every year15 A cap on the amount of hours an employer can make you workThe Working Time directive provides legal standards to ensure the health and safety of employees in Europe. Among the many rules are a working week of a maximum 48 hours, including overtime, a daily rest period of 11 hours in every 24, a break if a person works for six hours or more, and one day off in every seven. It also includes provisions for paid annual leave of at least four weeks every year25 Helping the people of Britain to avoid smokingIn 2014 MEPs passed the Tobacco Products Directive strengthening existing rules on the manufacture, production and presentation of tobacco products. This includes things like reduced branding, restrictions on products containing flavoured tobacco, health warnings on cigarette packets and provisions for e-cigarettes to ensure they are safe35 Helping you to make the right choices with your foodThanks to the European Parliament, UK consumers have access to more information than ever about their food and drink. This includes amount of fat, and how much of it is saturated, carbohydrates, sugars, protein and so on. It also includes portion sizes and guideline daily amount information so people can make informed choices about their diet. All facts must be clear and easy to understand45 Two year guarantees and 14-day returns policy for all productsConsumers across the EU have access to a number of rights, from things which are potentially very useful, to things which used to be annoying. For example, shoppers in the UK receive a two-year guarantee on all products, and a 14-day period to change their minds and return a purchase, these things are useful55 Keeping your air nice and fresh (and safe)Believe it or not, although the situation is improving, some areas of the UK have appalling air quality. A report by the Royal College of Physicians released on 23 February says 40,000 deaths are caused by outdoor air pollution in the UK every year. Air pollution is linked to a number of illnesses and conditions, from Asthma to diabetes and dementia. The report estimates  the costs to British business and the health service add up to £20 billion every yearThe Eurosceptic\u0026nbspvotes could also help derail already controversial international agreements – such as a possible free trade deal with a post-Brexit UK.“Simply put, winning a certain number of seats will give anti-European forces influence over key processes and decisions,” the report says.“Judging by what many of them have campaigned for, anti-European parties could use this increased share of seats to obstruct the EP’s work on foreign policy, eurozone reform, and freedom of movement, and could limit the EU’s capacity to preserve European values relating to liberty of expression, the rule of law, and civil rights.“Winning more than 33 per cent of seats would enable them to form a minority that could block some of the EU’s procedures and make the adoption of new legislation much more cumbersome – with a potentially damaging impact on the content of the EU’s foreign policy, as well as on the EU’s overall institutional readiness and its political credibility to take initiatives in the area.”The battle for Europe\u0027s soul may be lost, so how do we fight populism?Italy\u0027s governing party wrote off bridge safety fears as \u0027fairy story\u0027EU condemns rescue boats picking up drowning refugees in MediterraneanThe report looks at polls from across the continent and finds that under current projections the far-right is set to make advances – mirroring or exceeding those it has made at a national level since the last elections in 2014. It says “the far right and right-wing Eurosceptics will, if current polling is accurate, rise from 23 per cent to 28 per cent” with this potentially rising to around 30 per cent once the campaign is underway.“They could even gain more than 30 per cent of seats if their popularity continues to grow or if some of the fringe members of the mainstream join them. If they cross the one-third threshold, this would signify a qualitative change in the EU,” the report adds.In certain policy areas, dissent from the mainstream by the eurosceptic far-left – such as on trade, sanctions, and foreign policy – could also make passing legislation difficult.\u0026nbspThough the assorted eurosceptic parties across the continent have struggled to form a coherent alliance, when it comes to votes in parliament they have often voted in a similar direction. Despite being spread across disparate political groups, most populist forces voted against sanctions against Hungary in a crunch vote last year.There are also increasing moves to try to unite the groups – such as the plan for an “anti-immigration axis” proposed by Italy’s de facto leader Matteo Salvini. Far-right US figure Steve Bannon has also unveiled plans to unite the groups, though it is unclear whether he will be successful.\u0026nbspParliament isn’t perfect – in Brussels or Westminster“The warning in this report, that anti-European parties are gaining strength and could paralyse the EU, should concentrate the minds of pro-Europeans,” said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.“They must not become trapped into becoming defenders of the status quo in Europe or allowing the election to become a referendum on the issue of migration – which is exactly the battleground that the anti-Europeans want.“Instead, pro-Europeans need to unmute the silent majority by fighting different elections that Europe’s different publics will vote on – such as the climate change election, the ‘Facebook’ election for those concerned for their data and privacy, the election for those worried about Russian aggression, the prosperity election for those worried about stalled living standards, the rule of law election for those worried about democratic backsliding, and the ‘saving Europe’ election for the EU’s most ardent defenders.”\u0026nbspThe European Parliament elections are scheduled for 23-26 May. The UK is not scheduled to take part as it is on course to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It would last for decades\u0026nbspbecause it was native, “organic”, and had already survived several shock tests.\u0026nbspMr Surkov, responsible for the Kremlin’s domestic strategy during the 2000s,\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspcredited with creating much of Russia’s postmodern,\u0026nbspauthoritarian model of government.\u0026nbspHe called the system “managed democracy” – a term that critics suggested was only ever half true.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Anti-Putin protests: hundreds of demonstrators arrested in Russia Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Russian police officers detain a protester in MoscowPro-Kremlin activists and opposition supporters scuffle in MoscowAlexei Navalny during the rallyRussian police arrest a participant of a liberal opposition rallyAlexei Navalny being carried away by policeDemonstrator carries a poster depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin during a massive protest rally in St.PetersburgRussian police detain a protester at a demonstration A fighter of National Liberation Movement, left, clashes with protesters Russian police arrest a participant of a liberal opposition rally Russian police detain a protester in Pushkin Square in MoscowProtesters attend a rally in St. PetersburgRussian police officers detain a protester in MoscowPro-Kremlin activists and opposition supporters scuffle in MoscowAlexei Navalny during the rallyRussian police arrest a participant of a liberal opposition rallyAlexei Navalny being carried away by policeDemonstrator carries a poster depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin during a massive protest rally in St.PetersburgRussian police detain a protester at a demonstration A fighter of National Liberation Movement, left, clashes with protesters Russian police arrest a participant of a liberal opposition rally Russian police detain a protester in Pushkin Square in MoscowProtesters attend a rally in St. PetersburgIn his long and often rambling article, the aide stayed close to his historical form. Russia was strong, he argued, only because it had rejected western notions and democratic institutions. Such institutions\u0026nbsponly\u0026nbspgave\u0026nbspan “illusion of choice”, and were inferior to Russia’s wise\u0026nbspleader, who was\u0026nbspable to “listen, understand and see” his\u0026nbsppeople.“The modern model of Russian statehood begins on trust and rests on trust,” he said. “This is its major distinction to the western model, which cultivates distrust and criticism. And herein lies its\u0026nbspstrength.” \u0026nbspWriting on Facebook, the political commentator Abbas Gallyamov\u0026nbspnoted wryly that Mr Surkov’s idea of trust appeared at\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsptime of\u0026nbsppolls registering historically low levels of trust in\u0026nbspthe leadership.Putin heralds successful tests of new hypersonic nuclear weaponsStep up Vladimir Putin, president of Belarus? Putin: Russia will develop intermediate-range missiles if US doesMr Surkov spared little praise of his boss.\u0026nbspIn time, Putin’s Russia would be recognised Russia’s fourth great “model of state-building”, he said – and on a par with the efforts of Ivan the Great in the 15th century, Peter the Great in the 18th century, and Vladimir Lenin in the 20th century.\u0026nbspPutin’s system was also ripe for export, Mr Surkov\u0026nbspadded. Foreign governments were already paying close attention, since the\u0026nbspRussian “political algorithm” had long predicted\u0026nbspthe volatility now seen in western democracies.\u0026nbsp“Russia is playing with the west’s minds,” he writes. “They don’t know how to deal with their own changed consciousness.” \u0026nbspDuring his peak in the 2000s,\u0026nbspMr Surkov cultivated an image of being an all-powerful operator, expertly recruiting and co-opting all strands of ideology political opinion. But his ambitions always went further than being an operator. He saw himself as the beating intellectual heart of the regime.\u0026nbspMr Surkov, while still an influential player, is no longer at the heart of the Kremlin policy machine.\u0026nbspHe fell out of favour with Vladimir Putin\u0026nbspafter appearing to side with Dmitry Medvedev in the tempestuous protest years of 2008-2012, and\u0026nbspwas unceremoniously dropped in favour of rival Vyacheslav Volodin.\u0026nbspSince then, Mr Surkov is believed to have taken charge of the Kremlin’s secret campaign in eastern Ukraine, has acted as Russia’s point of contact in the Minsk peace negotiations, and\u0026nbsphas taken to penning lofty\u0026nbspessays about the state of Russia.\u0026nbspPresidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said\u0026nbspMr Surkov’s “complex”, “interesting” and “deep” article had been neither approved or seen\u0026nbspby the president. That said,\u0026nbspthose inside the corridors of power shared “many” of the\u0026nbspopinions.\u0026nbsp“Surkov has experience in domestic politics, in party politics and in state-building that\u0026nbspis hard to overestimate,” the spokesperson said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Heres what you need to know.May supported the UK remaining in the EU before the referendum - but was not a vocal supporter during the bitterly fought campaign.She became PM in  after David Cameron resigned over the polls result.Her entire premiership has been devoted to ensuring Britain has a smooth departure from the EU.She has always stated that Brexit means Brexit.And she has ruled out there being a second referendum despite her Brexit deal being voted against in Parliament.May says her government hasnt decided exactly how it will try to change the European Union orce deal to address concerns about the Irish border.Parliament voted on January  to replace a border measure in the agreement with unspecied alternative arrangements. Many U.K. lawmakers fear the backstop measure designed to ensure the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland remains free of customs checks will trap Britain in regulatory lockstep with the EU.Asked in the House of Commons on Wednesday what alternatives Britain was proposing, May said there are a number of proposals for how that could be done. She said measures under consideration included a unilateral exit mechanism for Britain, a time limit to the backstop and mutual recognition and trusted trader schemes.The EU insists the withdrawal deal cant be renegotiated.In her New Year message Theresa May said the Brexit deal she had negotiated delivers on the vote of the British people.She said it gives us control over our borders, our money and our laws.It is good for jobs, protects our security and works for our whole United Kingdom.She added: The referendum in  was isive, but we all want the best for our country. could be the year we put our dferences aside and move forward together into a strong new relationship with our European neighbours and out into the world as a globally trading nation.However Mays withdrawal deal, agreed with the EU in November , was rejected by MPs on January  by a staggering majority of  votes.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn immediately tabled a vote of no confidence in her Government.Beleaguered leader May limped on, narrowly surviving the vote of no confidence by  votes the following day.On January , the PM unveiled her plan to break Britains Brexit deadlock.But it emerged Plan B was still very much her Brexit deal with the EU — her original Plan A.She conceded there would have to be modications to it, as the disastrous vote proved “the Government’s approach had to change”.The PM added: “We need to see where we can ensure the support of this house, and then take that forward to the European Union”.Her declaration teed with up a Commons showdown on January  when an amendment to her plan — to seek an alternative to the Irish backstop — was voted through.For this to happen there will need to be fresh negotiations with Brussels.She has kept her proposed changes to the hated Irish backstop vague, though they are expected to involve asking for a legal time limit or unilateral exit mechanism.The PM told MPs:Mrs May said she would be speaking to the DUP and other colleagues before the end of January, and will go back to Brussels to tell them what is needed to get the deal over the line.We will work to identy how we can ensure that our commitment to no hard border in Northern Ireland and Ireland can be delivered in a way that commands the support of this House, and the European Union, she promised.Pointedly, Mrs May also raised Brexiteers’ fears by refusing to rule out implementing a customs unionthat is what Parliament demands.On February  May and Corbyn both agreed the EU must bend on the Brexit backstopthe deal is going to get signed off by MPs.The PM said she would go back to Brussels to demand more changes to the Northern Ireland agreement to deliver the Brexit the British people voted for.May has been told to hold another election this summer once Brexit is over.The PMs top civil servant recommended that she call a snap vote in Juneshe succeeds in getting her agreement past in the next few weeks.May and Corbyn have both agreed that the EU MUST bend on the Brexit backstopthe deal is ever going to get signed off by MPs.The Prime Minister said today she will go back to Brussels to demand more changes to the Northern Ireland agreement to deliver the Brexit the British people voted for.In a fresh call for national unity, she urged MPs on all sides of the debate to bury their dferences and help deliver the best possible Brexit.And in words that appeared to show a united front with the Labour boss, she said that even he agreed that the EU needed to budge.She wrote in the Sunday : Although Jeremy Corbyn didn’t vote with us, he also believes the potential indefinite nature of the backstop is an issue that needs to be addressed with Brussels.That is exactly what I’m doing.And in a message to other Labour MPs to come out and back her, she added: Its up to all of us at Westminster to make it work.Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn slammed Plan B saying this really does feel like Groundhog Day.He called the cross-party meetings a stunt and insisted a no deal Brexit must be ruled out as an option.May said that was an impossible condition.Instead, May looks set to try to win over pro-Brexit Conservatives and her partys Northern Irish ally, the Democratic Unionist Party.Both groups say they wont back the deal unless the border backstop is removed.There were signs some Brexiteers could reluctantly back Mrs Mays deal amid concerns a cross-party grouping of MPs are plotting to impose a softer Brexit - or derail it altogether.It is understood May wants to show the EU that MPs could back a deal without a backstop, in the hope of encouraging Brussels to soften its position.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I will never understand it and I can never forgive them, but I am not consumed with hate or thoughts of revenge.I just want to get on with my le and look to the future, not the past.

There’s so much he’s got to give! He’s completely positive!In footage from , the then anonymous backbench MP from the People’s Republic of Islington ­lambasts “the European empire” and mocks Brussels for wanting referendums re-run until they produce the “correct” result.Oh, Jeremy Corbyn!I bet all the middle-class kiddies who worshipped at your sandals-and-socks combo at Glastonbury never saw this coming.The footage of Corbyn dissing Brussels to an Irish audience is so incendiary it makes Liam Neeson look as though he chooses his words carefully.Comrade Corbyn really, really could not be clearer about his true feelings.“We are creating here one massive great Frankenstein which will damage all of us in the long run,” he says of the EU.“If you succeed in getting a No vote herethat will be such a boost to people like us, all over Europe, who do not want to live in a European empire of the st century.”You tell ’em, Boris! I mean, Jeremy!After being forced out of the Brexit closet, JC can no longer cynically have it both ways — playing a Remainer to the middle class and a Leaver to the working class. That hypocritical ploy to squeeze into  Downing Street will no longer fly.It is a dead ploy. That ploy is extinct. It is no more.On the great issue of our time, the old boy just got shoved right off the fence. And fell on his face.Donald Tusk, Brussels’ head bully boy, digressed from condemning .million Brits to hell for voting Leave to sneer that there is a “leadership void” in the Remain camp. He means YOU, Jeremy.Tusk has seen right through two-faced Corbyn, evenall the little Marxist morons who chant his name are only just waking up to the cruel truth. Corbyn deserves to be despised by both sides of the debate.He placed the prospect of power above his principles. And we still don’t really know how he voted in the Referendum — although we can make an educated guess.The irony is that Jeremy Corbyn could have been a true hero to the working-class men and women who have voted Labour for a letime and then voted in their millions to leave the EU.Corbyn could have spoken for those men and women and stood up for them when the sneering elite dismissed them as thick, racist bigots too stupid to have a valid opinion.It was Tony Benn, Corbyn’s great hero, and the most eloquent opponent of the European Union in our nation’s history, who famously said he felt like “a slave to Rome” when he went to Brussels.Tony Benn would have had the courage to advocate Brexit and ­Corbyn must know it.Jeremy will be a tiny footnote in our nation’s history but what a crying shame that, in our country’s time of need, the Labour Party could not produce a leader who would represent the millions of working-class men and women who have learned to despise the EU.Corbyn tried to play it smart — and still does — by endlessly parroting that “everything is on the table” and never truly engaging with the debate that has come close to tearing this country apart.And now he has been caught out because Corbyn, always more Mickey Mouse than Machiavelli, was never clever enough to play this duplicitous game.The EU is revealing its true nature — a bullying empire that has no interest in being a partner, friend or ally of the Britishwe eventually manage to leave.The EU wants to see us on our knees.The EU wants to see us suffer for refusing to be their obedient colony.The EU wants us to pay such a high price for leaving that the remaining countries will be too timid to dream of le beyond this democracy-despising empire.All we can do is oppose these arrogant, unelected bullies. All we can do is demand our independence — no matter the dark warnings, no matter the sneering, no matter the threat of punishment beatings.What a tragedy for Labour that their leader never had the guts to join this nation’s fight for independence.ELLE MACPHERSON has revealed her simple guide for looking drop dead gorgeous.Most of Elle’s tips are eminently doable for any of us – eat your evening meal early , get fresh air every day, have some calming tea before bedtime and,sleep doesn’t come, put your feet up for five minutes.Only one of The Body’s tips is more dficult to arrange – Elle suggests regular relaxation in a sauna or steam room – but most of her guidelines for healthy radiance are simple common sense.But she has missed the most important tip of all.Be born beautul.Don’t forget that one, Elle!THE Tories are very keen on “autonomous” vehicles – driverless cars with no steering wheels and “no human oversight” – and hope that they will be zipping about on our roads within two years.Automotive minister Richard Harrington says: “We need to ensure we take the public with us as we move towards having self-driving cars on our roads by .”But I remember when a Labour government swore to us that diesel cars were the bright, shining future.In , Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced tax changes to petrol-fuelled cars that led to a massive increase in idiots like me buying diesel cars.The thinking was that diesel would help the environment because diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide than petrol engines.Unfortunately, diesel also produces far more pollutants and poisons, resulting in around , deaths every year.Whoops.I now have an elderly diesel car sitting on the drive that everyone hates.My excuse is that Gordon Brown told me I was saving the planet.Nobody wants diesel today. That is why Japanese car- maker Nissan will not be building its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. Brexit doesn’t come into it.These days driving a diesel is considered to be slightly less healthy than smoking crack. And the Tory “dash to driverless” is as muddle-headed as the Labour “dash to diesel” when Gordon Brown was in his pomp.Driverless cars – what could possibly go wrong WHEN Prince Charles met the Spice Girls in , the Prince of Wales clearly towered above the then Geri Halliwell.Reunited this week, they now appear to be the same height.Has the former Ginger Spice grown over the last  years Or is our future king shrinking  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it strikes a powerful chord with real people, particularly voters in the North.They resent claims they are racist thickos and believe all parties lied to them in  when they promised to deliver on the referendum, whatever the outcome.Like the BBC — and, indeed, the EU itself — Remainers are slow to realise time is running out. Brexit is to the EU what Netflix is to the BBC. The £billion licence fee — like the European “Grand Project” — is on its way out.Whatever last-minute deal Theresa May brings home, the scepticism which brought Brexit to le cannot simply be turned off.It is a disruptive force and is already beginning to sweep away the EU as we know it.Economist Bernard Connolly famously identied this as the logical consequence of EU skulduggery in his book The Rotten Heart Of Europe: The Dirty War For Europe’s Money.Connolly was in charge of setting up the euro, the slow-burning catastrophe which has wrecked economies and young lives across the EU.He was sacked for exposing the secretive abuse of power at the very top, exposing the unscrupulous methods deployed by an unaccountable regime to bludgeon critics into submission.The same tactics are used on rebellious nations like Britain today and Greece in , triggering the explosion of anger we are seeing among protesting citizens and a rise of authoritarianism against such dissent.EU states are at each other’s throats — Italy against France, Brussels against Hungary and Poland.The rise of military-style policing — French police firing hard rubber bullets at unarmed yellow-jacket protestors, the jailing of dissident politicians in Catalonia — is alarming.Romania, a former Soviet police state, is reverting to type and spying on its own citizens.Hungary locks up opponents and silences the media.The EU does nothing, fearing for its own survival.Europe-wide polls reveal increasing antagonism to Brussels, deeper even than here in the UK.He remains a cherished champion of free speech and razor-sharp inquisitorial combat.Mean-spirited as ever, the left-wingcould not resist suggesting he was past his sell-by date.Not by such a margin as this preachy, unpopular rag which is about to go out of print.Those politicians who believe we mustto the EU’s totalitarian embrace are grievously out of step.Yes, Brexit has been botched, both by Theresa May and by Brexiteers themselves.

They walked in to find a naked woman on the bed.One of the visitors recalled: “There on the mattress on the floor in the one room is Diane with the duvet up to her neck, saying, ‘What the ****’s going on ’ We were quite shaken.” As Abbott tried to protect her modesty, Corbyn announced she was his new girlfriend.The source continued: “It was the late Seventies, it was still a point of interest, a white man with a black woman, so he was slightly showing off – ‘I’ve got a new girlfriend, and she’s black’.”At the time Abbott was working at the National Council for Civil Liberties.When colleagues went through her desk they found an eyebrow-raising sexual fantasy scrawled in her diary. In it she described being man- handled by her lover Corbyn – “a bearded Fenian and NUPE national organiser”.The loved-up pair went on a motorbike tour of East Germany, while Abbott has described her “finest half-hour” as romping in a Cotswold field with a mystery man, believed to be Corbyn.Author Bower claims the relationship broke down because Abbott wanted children but he did not.On one occasion, according to the new book, the family was invited to spend a week at a friend’s country home in Derbyshire, but Corbyn failed to show.For  hours, Claudia called around trying to track him down.He eventually arrived two days later, vaguely explaining his absence as a necessary sacrice for “the movement”.Even when Claudia was in hospital about to give birth to their first child in , Corbyn was more concerned with local leafletting.He was running for re-election at the time, and phoned constituency agent Keith Veness from outside the delivery room with an important update.Corbyn announced: “I’m really worried — we haven’t put out that leaflet about Northern Ireland.”His friend replied: “Haven’t you got something more serious to worry about ”Corbyn had met Claudia in  — seven years after his orce from first we Jane Chapman — at a protest meeting against Chile’s military dictatorship.Claudia was already married but, by the following year, she was pregnant with Corbyn’s child and rushed through a orce to marry her new admirer.They went on to have three boys — Sebastian, Benjamin and Thomas — before calling time on their relationship in .Corbyn managed to give the split a political spin, declaring the break was down to Claudia refusing to send their son to a failing comprehensive and he “felt strongly about comprehensive education”.But fellow Labour firebrand Ken Livingstone claims the marriage ended “long before the school bit”.She recalled: “Jeremy professed love early on and said that I was ‘the best of the best’, so I thought this must be the thing.”But the -year-old bride quickly discovered that “her husband was not interested in equality within marriage, or in sharing any domestic chores”.Despite the two of them both being councillors, she found herself doing the housework and being stuck alone in their small flat night after night.When Corbyn did arrive in time for dinner, he would often open a tin of beans, usually Tesco’s own brand, and eat them cold.On livelier evenings, he would sit on the floor drunkenly singing IRA songs. Jane’s requests to go out were ignored.Meanwhile, she was shocked that the opinionated “thinker” did not read a single book during their years together.Author Tom Bower writes: “Her initial judgment that he was ‘bright’ was mistaken.”Holidays were also grim — with his idea of a summer getaway being a tour with his we of an impoverished Eastern bloc country, sleeping in tents. The marriage ended in , with Corbyn patronisingly putting the split down to a “feminist kick”.Chapman, now a university professor and filmmaker, said: “He didn’t acknowledge my emotional side. He doesn’t recognise a woman’s feelings.”She added: “His lack of emotional awareness didn’t change.”And, in his new book, author Tom Bower claims it was a result of Corbyn’s poor financial management. Corbyn was funding his party office in Holloway, North London, out of his own pocket and was seriously in debt.Claudia and their three young sons were left with so little money for food and clothes that she once pleaded: “We can’t afford a decent le.”Eventually, after the couple split, the family home in Islington, North London, was sold for £,to pay off the debts.Claudia and the boys moved into the top floors of a smaller home, with Corbyn in the basement. There he had a series of flings with younger women, according to Bower’s book, out on February .His success with the opposite sex confused many, with one old friend telling him: “You couldn’t pull all these womenyou weren’t an MP. They wouldn’t be interested in an old man with a beard.”The hard-Left MP for North Islington was far more understanding when it came to Soviet communist leaders oppressing others.His old friend Keith Veness said Corbyn believed Soviet leaders had rightly put down a revolt in Hungary in  and the pro-democracy Prague Spring in .And when Veness mentioned Joseph Stalin’s brutality against his own people, he says: “Jeremy walked away. He couldn’t do political arguments.”In the extract from his book in yesterday’s Mail on Sunday, author Bower also portrays Corbyn’s party as an anarchic mess where neither the leader nor many of his overpaid team turn up for meetings on time.He writes: “Meetings arranged to start at am were delayed because no one arrived until , and some staff did not come to work at all.” An insider told the author: “They were lazy and p***ed on £, a year.”Meanwhile, in the same year as his orce, Corbyn met Mexican ex-human rights lawyer Laura Alez,  years his junior.They conducted a long-distance relationship before she moved to the UK in , and they wed the following year.Laura has rarely spoken about their relationship — but, in , gave a telling insight into marriage with the proud leftie: “He’s not very good at housework.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ben Fogle, who hosted the show with Sara Cox, had been caught up in controversy too when he was accused of labelling Staffies dangerous – a claim he firmly denies.Here, AMY JONES reveals the hero Staffies rebuilding their reputation.AT .am, Jordan Ash was woken by his dog ­Diesel ­manically barking, scratching and pulling at the duvet.Jordan immediately knew something was seriously wrong, as the three-year-old rescue dog’s behaviour was so out of character.The -year-old said: “I jumped out of bed and opened the bedroom door to find flames five or six feet away from us.”Jordan, from Dartmouth, Devon, raced to wake his parents, Chris, , and Tina, , who were asleep in their room.He helped them escape through a small bedroom window over the kitchen roof then went to get Diesel from his room.Despite being almost overcome by the smoke and fumes, he reached his pet and passed him through the open window to his dad and they all scrambled down to safety.Speaking about the May  blaze, Jordan said: “Luckily, apart from a few bumps and bruises, probably from squeezing out of a tiny window, no one was seriously hurt.“We all needed treatment for smoke inhalation but there was no lasting damage thanks to Diesel.“His whiskers were singed by the fire but we got him checked out by a vet the following day and he was fine.“The next few weeks I slept on sofas because we couldn’t find anywhere to stay that would take ­Diesel as well.“After everything he had done for us there was no way I was going to leave him.”A fridge freezer was later found to have caused the fire, which damaged the house so badly the family could not move back in for ten months.The family had rescued Diesel after he was abandoned when just a few months old.Jordan added: “Diesel saved our lives and I will be for ever grateful.“I like to think it was his way of ­repaying us for ­rescuing him.“Staffies have a bad reputation but he has the most lovely, placid nature.”Last year Diesel was presented with a PDSA Gold Medal – otherwise known as the George Cross for animals – for his bravery.RESCUE dog Cooper is one of the only Staffies working for a police force in ­Britain. In less than a year he has helped hunt down more than £, of heroin and cocaine.The two-year-old, who was a stray before being rescued by the RSPCA, joined the service in April . He is trained to find drugs, cash and guns – and great at busting negative stereotypes about his breed.His handler PC Tim Moss said: “I’m ­privileged to have him – he’s an amazing dog and we have an amazing bond.”Cooper spent seven months with the RSPCA looking for a home. PC Moss said: “One day he was in the kennels, and now he’s a fully-fledged police dog.Owners don’t always have experience with this breed of dog, which can be where some of the stereotypes about Staffies come from.“Having Cooper when doing a raid is a great ice-breaker. People are shocked we are working a Staffie – as either they have or they know someone who has one.”PC Moss reckons Cooper is one of the best police dogs in Staffordshire and has become something of an A-lister in his county, being invited on school tours and to meet the public.He believes the negative stereotypes surrounding Staffies could not be ­further from the truth.He added: “Staffies are very unique.”Staffordshire bull terriers are so misunderstood.”WHEN Andy Hutchins left London’s ­Pentonville Prison five years ago after ­serving time for burglary, he planned to use the £ in his pocket to buy a fatal dose of heroin and take his own le.But a tiny puppy named Bailey changed that. Andy, now , bought the four-week-old dog from a woman begging on the street.Thanks to Bailey, Andy turned his back on crime and drugs – despite having spent  years in and out of jail – and is now ­training to be a social worker.Andy recalls how he spotted two women using two tiny pups “as small as mice” to beg. He pleaded for them to be ed to their mum – and one of the women agreed to sell him a pup for £.He took the dog straight to the vet – who recommended it be put down.But Andy refused and he kept ­Bailey huddled close and fed him a diet of goat’s milk and mashed potato. ­Bailey soon thrived.Andy turned his back on crime and on his £-a-day heroin habit.He said: “Having Bailey made me get my act together. I couldn’t be out of it because I had to protect him and make sure he was fed.”The first year was tough.He and Bailey were both attacked. ­Bailey was shot at and even stolen when he was three months old – Andy had to raise £ to buy him back.Then the pair got support from StreetVet, a charity that gives free vet ­treatment to animals living with homeless people, and co-founder Sam Joseph helped Andy find housing.Andy said: “When StreetVet came along, they ­provided food for him and it meant I could get on a methadone programme and rebuild my le.“When dealers came trying to sell drugs, he’d growl and bark at them. He seem­ed to know he needed to take care of me.”Former builder Andy’s le had spiralled downward after taking heroin for the first time aged .His relationship with his ­former partner and son broke down and he lost his job, his home and possessions.He was caught in a cycle of crime to fund his habit. He added: “Bailey meant I had a le to be responsible for. He saved me the day I saved him.“Having this little dog relying on me taught me how to love and trust again and I owe my le to him.”SHE was used as a breeding machine then cruelly dumped at the side of a road.Yet Bindi went on to help her caring new owner – and five other dogs.After being abandoned in September , Bindi was rescued by Senior Staffy Club, a charity dedicated to older Staffies.There she had  tumours removed from her body and was nursed back to care, eventually finding a full-time home with NHS worker Vicky Osborn.Vicky, , from Manchester, said: “I’d just lost my mum and we both saved each other.It was like we were meant to find each other. Within a week she was my shadow, my best friend.”But four months later, Bindi’s tumours ed, growing aggressively, and the dog, then , was moved to palliative care.Determined for her last weeks to be full of positivity, Vicky asked the Senior Staffy Club to set up a donation fund, Bindi’s ­Legacy, to help other dogs with cancer.Bindi died last September but the fund has since raised more than £, and already paid for operations for five dogs.Vicky said: “Senior Staffy Club gave Bindi two extra years of high-quality le after a miserable existence and now she is giving a similar gt to other dogs.“Bindi gave unconditional love, found joy in everything and instinctively knew how to comfort when I felt down.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That exposes the ­shallowness of ministers’ ­posturing as heroic saviours of the poor and dispossessed.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt told the Cabinet last month this level of aid spending was “unsustainable” and money should be shted to domestic priorities.She has floated the idea of ­building new ships for the Royal Navy from the aid ­budget by using them for humanitarian operations.And she knows the issue will rear up in any forthcoming Tory leadership battle.Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson chipped in, saying Britain needs more control over what counts as foreign aid under international rules — and that it should go towards boosting British foreign policy objectives.His move was linked to a report by former soldier turned Tory MP Bob Seely arguing that Britain should simply define its own aid spending to include our ­“strategic goals”.Yet they all miss the obvious solution. Just DITCH the target and abandon the  law binding us to it — one that makes the Department for International Developmentthe only ministry that must explain itself to MPsit fails to spend enough.This silly UN target is an historic anachronism devised by campaigners half a century ago based on flawed, outdated economic data.It makes no sense to rely on a fixed spending target based on national income over needs in poor places — as predicted by a former Tory Chancellor, respected Labour peers and a British economist who won the Nobel Prize for their expertise in poverty.One horried DfID minister confessed to me he thought spending was at least TRIPLE what it should be — yet whenever he tried to thwart wasteful projects, they simply bounced back from officials on to his desk again.It was no surprise to find those pen-pushers in the poverty relief department are among the best-paid bureaucrats in Whitehall.This torrent of cash has fuelled a self-serving aid industry stuffed with fat cats on six-figure salaries in charities and private firms.These people are so focused on protecting their valuable brands that some of the best-known organisations covered up abuse, rape, malpractice and theft.Their political paymasters pose as municent saviours of the world. Yet as I have seen on three continents, much of the money taken from taxpayers is blown on ludicrous projects based on bogus statistics — and ends up doing more harm than good by fostering conflict and undermining democracy.I was in Ghana last year, investigating a UK-funded scheme to pour cash into a few villages to prove aid works.“Far from breaking the poverty trap, the project does not appear to have reduced poverty or hunger at all,” concluded DfID’s own report.Yet we give cash to fast-emerging powerhouses such as China and India.We give cash to countries riddled with corruption, such as Uganda, where I found officials inflating the number of refugees to grab more funds from foreign donors.We give cash to places that have space programmes, even their own aid agencies.And we pour cash into countries run by gangsters spending huge sums on weapons — and in Rwanda’s case, on the brutal president’s favourite Premier League football club, Arsenal.Even North Korea, which runs massive death camps under a bloodstained family dictatorship, has been a beneficiary of UK aid. This is what happens when politicians prioritise spin and spending over needs and reality.Holland has showed a country can get off this hook. It abandoned the target and found the anticipated fuss died down quickly.The sht led to renewed focus on efficient spending, with fewer countries receiving donations. “We were surprised it was so easily dealt with,” one insider told me.Dutch spending has dipped from . per cent of national income in  to . per cent last year and will fall again over the coming years.Let us welcome the dawning realisation in Westminster that fixating on an aid target has been a dire failure.Instead of tinkering with definitions — or deceiving voters by slipping domestic spending under the foreign aid banner — politicians should accept their mistake and abandon that daft targetOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Amber Rudd said she accepted a link between soaring food bank use and the Government’s hated flagship benefit shake-up. She told MPs that the dficulties in accessing cash could have been “the main issue” behind the surge in people going hungry. The number of emergency food parcels handed out by the Trussell Trust charity has soared from , in   to .million last year.It came as two influential anti-poverty MPs suggested that Ms Rudd was on the brink of making radical changes to Universal Credit . Tory MP Heidi Allen and independent Labour MP Frank Field, who have launched a major investigation into food bank use, told the Mirror that her “legs are moving”.Previously, senior Tories have refused to accept welfare changes were a factor in the rise - instead claiming there were several dferent causes.Theresa May said in April  there were “many complex reasons” why people used food banks.Ms Rudd’s predecessor Esther McVey previously tried to blame the explosion on Labour, who she said “refused” to let Jobcentres signpost people to them before . Just four months ago a junior DWP minister, Alok Sharma, prompted shouts of “pathetic” as he insisted the rise could not be attributed to a single reason.   But Ms Rudd finally admitted to MPs: “It is absolutely clear that there were challenges with the initial rollout of Universal Credit. “And the main issue that led to an increase in food bank use could have been the fact that people had dficulty accessing their money early enough. “We have made changes to accessing Universal Credit so that people can have advances, so that there is a legacy run-on after two weeks, of housing benefit, and we believe that will help with food insecurity.” The Welfare Secretary insisted things had improved since the initial rollout of the six-in-one welfare system.  The Trussell Trust, Britain’s biggest foodbank network, has long insisted UC was behind a surge in demand at its outlets. Chief executive Emma Revie said: “It’s promising to see the Secretary of State is listening to the evidence of food banks across the UK. “We’re a country that prides itself on making sure proper support is in place for each other when help is most needed – our benefits system was created to do exactly this. “But Universal Credit isn’t the poverty-fighting reform that was promised. “What we need now is action to address the reasons why Universal Credit has forced some people to food banks.” People moving on to the benefit were until last year forced to wait six weeks for their first payment.   Even with the huge delay, a whopping % were not paid their full amount on time as of July last year. The standard delay has since been cut to five weeks, which Ms Rudd has accepted despite campaigners warning it is still pushing people into poverty. Ms Rudd also told MPs: “I have acknowledged the fact that people had dficulty accessing the money on time as one of the causes for the growth in food banks. “But we have tried to address that and one of the principal ways of doing that is ensuring every applicant can have advance payments on the day that they apply.” In an interview with the Mirror, veteran anti-poverty campaigner Mr Field predicted she would halt the roll-out of UC before the Government’s deadline of . “Amber has been burned by what happened at the Home Office. She ain’t going to be brought down again by what civil servants tell her about what is advisable,” he said. “By all means the date is good cover but the Secretary of State’s legs are moving.” Tory MPs Ms Allen, who voted for welfare cuts in  but has campaigned against UC ever since, called for Ms Rudd to scrap the five week wait. “It’s changing with Amber, which is why the timing of our investigation is so important. “She clearly is listening. Now is particularly important timing-wise that we demonstrate what it’s like out there and that there are problems with the system,” she said.   “I want to prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, so that the Government cannot ignore it any longer, the fundamental flaws of the welfare system that must be changed.”Jeremy Corbyn said on Monday: “The Conservatives have now admitted that Universal Credit has left even more people reliant on food banks.“So why haven’t they stopped the roll out ” The PM’s official spokesman said: “We have long acknowledged that there were issues with the initial rollout of Universal Credit and that’s why we have listened and made improvements such as extending advances, removing waiting days and introducing housing benefit run-on. “These changes are giving support to vulnerable people who need it most while at the same time helping people get into work faster.” A DWP spokesman added: “We have always said that there are many reasons people use food banks and you cannot link to any one cause, we’ve responded quickly to the feedback we have had on UC and made numerous improvements.” Last August the Department for Work and Pensionslaunched an internal study costing pound, to examinewelfare policies have prompted food bank use. A source close to Ms Rudd said her comments were not linked to that study.

But with  days left, Mrs May is expected to plead for more time in her House of Commons statement at .pm - immediately after a meeting of the Tory Cabinet.  The Prime Minister will describe negotiations between Brussels and Dublin over the backstop clause - which could trap the UK in EU customs rules, in order to keep the Irish border open. Downing Street said the statement, which comes a day earlier than expected, will give MPs more time to digest the content ahead of a series of expected Commons votes on Thursday. Mrs May is expected to say: The talks are at a crucial stage. We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this House has required and deliver Brexit on time. By getting the changes we need to the backstop by protecting and enhancing workers rights and environmental protections and by enhancing the role of Parliament in the next phase of negotiations I believe we can reach a deal that this House can support.  Votes on her statement this Thursday are non-binding and are widely expected to be a flop. Instead all eyes are on the meaningful vote on a revised -page Brexit deal - which isnt expected until next month. Labour was due to force Mrs May to hold an earlier meaningful vote on her deal, but reports today suggest that is fizzling out. And today top Tory Andrea Leadsom refused to guarantee the vote will happen before an EU summit on March . In a bombshell admission, the Leader of the Commons twice refused to rule out a high-stakes showdown from Monday  March, after the summit and four days before the UK leaves.  Instead she told BBC Radio : Well the PM is seeking to bring back the meaningful vote just as soon as possible. It is a negotiation, it’s not possible to predict the future, but the meaningful vote will come back to Parliament as soon as the issue around the backstop has been sorted out. She said talks were going flat out and insisted: Its not running down the clock. But she did not rule it out.She did, however, claimed the Prime Minister had absolutely ruled out a customs union with the EU - days after Mrs May left the possibility open in a compromise letter to Jeremy Corbyn .Ms Leadsom also insisted laws will be passed in time by Brexit Day despite widespread warnings they will not. Those that need to be passed by  March, Im confident will be passed, she said. Talks are continuing apace between the UK and EU, with Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Mrs Mays de facto deputy, David Lidington, meeting MEPs in Strasbourg today.  On the second leg today Mr Barclay will meet irascible EU Parliament Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt in Strasbourg. The government described a dinner between Mr Barclay and EU negotiator Michel Barnier last night as constructive. But Mr Barniers message earlier in the day yesterday was uncompromising, saying Something has to give on the British side and We are not going to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. The Withdrawal Agreement is the -page Brexit deal that contains the crucial Irish backstop. Mrs May wants a time limit, exit clause or alternative arrangements to the backstop - which could mean having to reopen talks. That means talks remain in deadlock,  days before we leave.

He has been sent an open letter after we reported that he endorsed a private dentistry firm which exploits patients no longer able to access an NHS dentist. The Mirror revealed that he was backing Access MyDentist which targets areas of his constituency with big shortages offering more expensive private work.Written by Bolton MP Yasmin Qureshi and signed by  Labour MPs, the letter comes as new data shows more than a million new patients tried and failed to secure access to an NHS dentist last year.Half of all NHS surgeries are closed to new patients because of a Tory funding crisis, it is estimated. In Mr Hancock’s West Suffolk constituency, fewer than one in  is taking new adults and some patients face a -mile round trip for a place.   Access MyDentist is expanding in such areas, promoted as “almost as cheap as the NHS”. Visiting an Access MyDentist surgery in rural Mildenhall, Suffolk, Mr Hancock said: “Companies like MyDentist play a really important role in delivering a good service to keep our nation’s teeth strong.” The letter says: “We felt compelled to write to you having seen the media coverage of your recent comments regarding problems with access to NHS dentistry in Mildenhall in your constituency. It continues: “As MPs representing areas facing signicant challenges with accessing NHS dentistry, we were extremely disappointed to hear your reaction to the news that MyDentist tries to profit from a shortage of NHS dentists in the area by encouraging patients to turn to a ‘value’ range of private treatments instead.   “Unless the system is appropriately funded and commissioned the problems facing patients in constituencies like ours will soon be shared by patients in every corner of England.” Data published last week has shown sweeping cuts to NHS budgets. In  the Government provided pound per person to cover dental care for every adult and child in England. By  this had fallen by pound in real terms, a drop of nearly %.

But thanks to underfunding and a failed contract, over a million new patients across England have been left with no choice at all. “The Government can’t keep pretending that access problems will be solved with warm words.

Some  miles from Westminster, St Barnabas Church stands on the corner of Westminster Road in Morecambe’s West End and is two junctions from Parliament Street. It could not be more dferent from its famous, powerful namesakes to the south.Yet it is here the MPs – Independent Frank Field, formerly of Labour , and Conservative Heidi Allen – have come to listen, not talk.They want to hear the awful, heart-rending stories of how townsfolk have been hit by Government cuts, frustrated by a welfare system rapped in red tape and, in some cases, hammered by sheer bad luck. The Commons Work and Pensions Committee – which Frank chairs and of which Heidi is a member - is investigating poverty across our land and Morecambe is the latest stop on their grim tour which also takes in Newcastle, Leicester and London.   Meet -year-old Daniel Burba. Daniel stoops above the formica-topped tables bearing cellophane-covered bowls of crisps, chocolate biscuits and Quality Street sweets. Frequently breaking down and physically supported by a friend, he snfs away his tears as he reveals how as a teenager he was lured into selling drugs by “big adults” on his estat. He hoped they were plotting his path out of poverty. “We were , we were kids. They forced you to sell heroin and crack. You’re so afraid of what will happen to youyou don’t do it,” he says. “There’s nothing . If all the youth stuff hadn’t been taken away, we wouldn’t have been pulled away to these streets, to these men. “A few of my mates had to hide guns for them. They pay you, and when you have younger brothers and sisters needing to be fed, it’s stressful trying to make the right decision. “F****** , I shouldn’t have had to put up with it. My mam and dad never knew where we was getting the money from. “I had a paper round, I pretended it was that.”   Daniel is dismayed by the bureaucracy of central and local government, and the hoops he had to jump through before he could receive help. He also rails against the box-ticking culture he feels riddles the system. “Treat me as you would want to be treated see me as a person, not a number,” he cries. And he echoes a familiar refrain, accusing the Government of fuelling a race where the “rich get richer and the poor get poorer”. Heidi wipes away a tear while Frank listens intently, taking notes for their investigation. Around the room, some guests’ eyes are damp. Others look genuinely angry. A baby, less than a year old, is desperately trying to force out her first words – innocent hope amid the downcast gloom.   Now meet Karen Wheeler, . Karen is well-spoken, almost posh. Her accent is not local. She speaks very quietly, almost whispering – a sign of her nerves as she confides the horrying route to her downfall. Karen played lacrosse at her private school. She has a masters degree, a teaching qualication and once briefed Government ministers in Whitehall. In  she was married, had an “excellent job” and was happy – until she was diagnosed with a neurological condition. She had breaks from work for health reasons then lost her mother and split from her husband.   The housing crisis hit and the family home sold for less than they hoped. Karen hurt her knee, had five operations and a knee replacement. Her mental health began to deteriorate and her daughter, Emily, also fell ill . Karen had to leave her latest job to look after her. Karen’s situation continued to spiral downhill. She used up her savings. She began self-harming, carving the words “failure”, “freak” and “waste of space” into her arms, legs and stomach. She thought about suicide. “I felt my daughter would be better off without me round,” she admits. “I stockpiled tablets waiting for the right moment. “The rent was impossible to pay, every letter and phone call was threatening. “The debts were racking up at an impossible rate and I was served an eviction notice.” She visited food banks – the local Trussell Trust outlet fed  people last month, up % on January  – and was baffled by the maze of DWP forms that needed completing before she could receive benefits. She also took personally the blizzard of stereotypes aimed at welfare claimants. “Every news bulletin seemed to be calling me a ‘scrounger’ or a ‘fraud’ or a ‘cheat’ or ‘scum’,” she says. “Poverty can happen to anyone, in any position, from any background, at any time. “All it requires is a chain of unfortunate events.” Karen’s voice trembles and she reaches for Emily, the strong, redhead teenager who supports her mother.   Emily, who is studying for A-levels, retains her composure as she matter-of-factly explains how she and her mum were often left with just pound-a-week after paying bills. Once, Emily’s school held a non-unorm day to raise cash for a children’s charity. Her classmates each donated a quid, but Emily could not afford to contribute. “People looked at me and I could tell they thought I was selfish by not wanting to part with a pound for a disadvantaged child,” she says. “No-one knew that might have been me. To them it probably seemed irrelevant but a pound meant milk or bread.” Another speaker tells of a family with five kids who have been burning wooden pallets as winter bites. These bleak, desperate and anguished stories do not even shock now. Calling for “the cuts to stop”, today’s organiser Siobhan Collingwood, a local headmistress, points out: “These are not extreme examples – this is the reality of daily le for far too many people living in our community.”One common complaint centres on Universal Credit , the Government’s flagship welfare overhaul which rolls six benefit payments into one.Delays and complications with the shake-up are shattering the Welfare State’s reputation for helping those most in need. Urging a revamp will form a major part of the MPs’ recommendations.   Frank vows: “The two policies we will be pressing most on will be to scrap the freeze on benefits and to,possible, make Universal Credit work.” Heidi adds: “The Universal Credit five week wait for the first payment is utterly dysal.” Those who bravely told of their personal plights despair of a system where, they believe, strict form-filling and tough regulations trump compassion and common sense. This is why they are speaking out - to remind the powerful that decisions taken in Westminster eventually ripple out across our country and, for some, can prove disastrous.

Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said: “With the energy market in disarray and households facing a huge bill hike months after the price cap came into effect, Ofgem has questions to answer over the timing and appropriateness of these bonuses.” John O’Connell, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: “It’s not acceptable to be dishing out taxpayers’ money for huge bonuses while the watchdog has overseen some woefully ineffective policies. “Bonuses should be a reward for success, not failure.”   Figures obtained under Freedom of Information laws show between April and the end of December last year, Ofgem paid a total of pound, in bonuses to  civil servants.

It also upped the limit for four million customers on pre-payment meters from April . The announcement came a month after a cap on standard iable tarfs came in.  E.ON said: “Ofgem’s review set out that price cap levels would increase. In line with that, we’ll be making changes to our standard iable prices and expect similar movements across the industry.” Victoria Arrington, of Energyhelpline, said: “There is little doubt this is just the beginning of a crushing wave of price hikes across the Big Six.” And Peter Earl, of Comparethemarket, said: “For the past few years, consumers were hit by price increases with concerning regularity.

She was killed by tiger , Asim, who arrived at the zoo late last month specically to be her mate. The two tigers had been kept in neighbouring enclosures since Asims arrival so they could get used to each others smell. But when staff introduced the pair this morning, Sumatran Melati was brutally killed within minutes. Now, London Zoos chief operating officer, Kathryn England, has revealed what happened when the two Big Cats met each other for the first time.   Kathryn has known ten-year-old Melati since she joined London Zoo in  and says Friday was one of the most dficult days of my career. She described Melati as beautul, majestic, spirited – and every inch a tiger. The expert explained Asim, seven, had been brought to London Zoo from Denmark as part of the Europe-wide breeding programme for Sumatran tigers. Kathryn said: We started the day in nervous anticipation, excited than our beautul Sumatran tiger, Melati, would have to chance to become a mum again. Asim and Melati had been kept side-by-side, but separated by mesh, since his arrival at the zoo.  The pair had been callng and chuffing to one another - a good sign. Kathryn said: Both seemed comfortable and even chose to eat their breakfast within feet of each other. Chuffing is a friendly noise that tigers use to greet each other, usually during courtship or when a mum is greeting her cubs. It indicates interest and curiosity. It might be the human equivalent of a saying “hello lovely, how are you ”. Occasionally the tigers will chuff at their keepers too, and those are moments they all treasure. Staff at the zoo, with more than  years of experience between them, had been carefully observing Melati and Asim and on Friday thought the time was right to properly introduce them to one another.  Kathryn said: Several people from outside the zoo have remarked that  days seems fast to introduce tigers to each other. It’s not – it’s wildly iable and depends entirely on careful observation of their behaviour. Conversely, it can be risky to leave tigers showing an interest in each other out of contact for too long, leading to a build-up of tension and frustration. In the run up to Friday, plans were careful drawn up - including precautions as to how they would reactall did not go to plan. The team had fire extinguishers, air horns and flares ready to distract the Big Catsneeded. They did have transquiliser darts but these can be hard to shoot woth accuracy and can take up to  minutes to take effect. Kathryn said: The perimeter of the exhibit was carefully walked and checked for anything out of place that could alarm the tigers.  The surroundings were quiet and calm. We opened the gate between the two enclosures and watched carefully. Initially everything about their meeting was as we expected. They watched each other, they were cautiously interested and they snfed the air for several minutes. But then things began to take a tragic turn and Kathry explained that part of tigers’ natural behaviour is territorial and aggressive, and they are strong and fast animals. Males often posture at females to show their dominance and both tigers swiped and reared up at each other. Then tragedy struck. Kathryn said: In the blink of an eye, with no obvious provocation, they turned on each other and our years of experience told us it was beyond normal.  The initial skirmish lasted a few seconds and we were already reacting. Asim started to retreat and we were poised to close the gate when Melati lashed back out at him. He overpowered her in a split second. Everyone sprang into action lighting flares, sounding airhorns and setting off fire extinguishers and hoses. Unfortunately by the time Asim retreated the second time and we could close the gate, Melati had been fatally injured. It took moments. Everyone was numb with shock, and the sheer disbelief was palpable. As soon it was safe our vets ran to Melati with every hope they might yet save her, and even these experienced professionals of the zoo world were entirely distraught to find they couldn’t. Staff had to turn their attention to Asim, who had also been through an ordeal. Kathryn stressed the breeding programme was key because of the very real threat of extinction that tigers are facing.  She said: Melati had a crucial role here generating advocacy for a species that is perilously on the brink a role that she was clearly fulfilling gauging by the reaction to her passing. I would love to see this awful moment trigger a greater understanding of the challenges faced by her species in the wild. Melati contributed to a more secure future for tigers, not only through her cubs but through the affinity she built with our many visitors – reinforcing why zoos like ours play such an important role in the future of wild animals. Upset animal lovers have expressed their horror following Melatis death on Twitter . Lauren Hickling wrote: As a regular visitor of Melati, we went last weekend in fact, I am very sad to hear of this awful news. Lib With Attitude added: This has brought tears to my eyes on the train. Melati was so beautul. And Samantha Smith said: My daughter is absolutely devastated. Melati was a beautul tigress. Rainbow Kitty wrote: Such a sad loss of a beautul creature. RIP Melati, over the rainbow bridge. Zookeepers had flown to Denmark to get to know the male Sumatran. At the time they said: We learned that he adores chicken and loves to play, particularly by pouncing on piles of empty boxes sprayed with strong scents such as herbs and spices. Melati had previous cubs, born at London Zoo. But tragically, in , one of her cubs died when it was just two weeks old. It had been the first tiger to be born at the zoo in  years. Melati went on to have a second litter of cubs in .

And referring to Samantha, Meghan wrote: On a daily basis you ﬁxated and clicked on the lies they were writing about me, especially those manufactured by your other daughter, who I barely know… you watched me silently suffer at the hand of her vicious lies, I crumbled inside. She accused her dad of lying about her and Prince Harry in press stories, and family members say their relationship is now damaged beyond repair .

Last week People magazine revealed the letters existence, and anonymous friends of Meghans said they were concerned the emotional trauma of dealing with her dad could have a negative effect on her baby.

Your actions have broken my heart into a million pieces — not simply because you have manufactured such unnecessary and unwarranted pain, but by making the choice to not tell the truth as you are puppeteered in this. Something I will never understand. You’ve told the press that you called me to say you weren’t coming to the wedding — that didn’t happen because you never called. You’ve said I never helped you ﬁnancially and youve never asked me for help which is also untrue you sent me an email last October that said: ‘If I’ve depended too much on you for ﬁnancial help then I’m sorry but pleaseyou could help me more not as a bargaining chip for my loyalty.’  I have only ever loved, protected, and defended you, offering whatever ﬁnancial support I could, worrying about your health... and always asking how I could help. So the week of the wedding to hear about you having a heart attack through a tabloid was horrying. I called and texted... I begged you to accept help — we sent someone to your home... and instead of speaking to me to accept this or any help, you stopped answering your phone and chose to only speak to tabloids. If you love me, as you tell the press you do, please stop. Please allow us to live our lives in peace. Please stop lying, please stop creating so much pain, please stop exploiting my relationship with my husband... I realise you are so far down this rabbit hole that you feelthere’s no way out, butyou take a moment to pause I think you’ll see that being able to live with a clear conscience is more valuable than any payment in the world. I pleaded with you to stop reading the tabloids. On a daily basis you ﬁxated and clicked on the lies they were writing about me, especially those manufactured by your other daughter, who I barely know… you watched me silently suffer at the hand of her vicious lies, I crumbled inside. We all rallied around to support and protect you from day , and this you know. So to hear about the attacks you’ve made at Harry in the press, who was nothing but patient, kind, and understanding with you is perhaps the most painful of all.  For some reason you choose to continue fabricating these stories, manufacturing this ﬁctitious narrative, and entrenching yourself deeper into this web you’ve spun. The only thing that helps me sleep at night is the faith and knowing that a lie can’t live forever. …I believed you, trusted you, and told you I loved you. The next morning the CCTV footage came out. You haven’t reached out to me since the week of our wedding, and while you claim you have no way of contacting me, my phone number has remained the same. This you know.

The murderer known as Jack the Stripper claimed more victims than his Victorian namesake Jack the Ripper during a grisly spree in the s – but the monster was never caught. Now, new information could lead to the identity of the man behind the Hammersmith nude murders. David Wilson, a former prison governor and professor of criminology at Birmingham City University, has handed evidence he collected to the Met Police, who are considering it. After a -month probe – detailed in a BBC documentary tonight – Prof Wilson is convinced Jack the Stripper was Welsh child killer Harold Jones. He says he found crucial links between Jones and the murder of at least six sex workers in the then red light district of West London around Shepherd’s Bush.   The sadistic crimes, in which the killer strangled and stripped his victims before removing their teeth, sparked one of the biggest manhunts in history. “Lots of people put forward dferent theories about the identity of the killer,” says Prof Wilson. “But, frankly, only one really stands out. Andwe could prove this theory, it has every possibility of delivering to the Met something they didn’t have  years ago, and that’s a genuine prime suspect.”  Jones died of bone cancer in Hammersmith in , and the children of Jack the Stripper’s victims still await justice. One of the first victims, -year-old prostitute Hannah Tailford, originally from Northumberland, was found dead on February , , her body fished out of the Thames at Hammersmith.   She had been strangled, several of her teeth were missing and her underwear had been forced down her throat. Her son Steven Sloman, , said: “The general attitude then was just, ‘Well, it’s just a prostitute’. “At the end of the day, whatever happened, she was a mum. “Justice was not done and I would like them to open to case, find evidence and maybe come up with closure, and say, ‘It could have been this person here’.”  By the time of the killings – the other victims were pregnant Irene Lockwood, , Helen Barthelemy, , Mary Fleming, , Frances Brown, , and Bridget O’Hara,  – Jones was already a convicted double child killer. When he was , Jones murdered Freda Burnell, eight, in Abertillery, Monmouthshire, but was acquitted due to lack of physical evidence. Just  days later, he murdered -year-old Florence Little, hiding her body in his parents’ attic, and confessed to murdering Freda after his second trial. He escaped hanging due to his age and was instead got  years’ jail. After his release from Wandsworth Prison in , he joined the Merchant Navy.  Then, according to Prof Wilson in documentary Dark Son: The Hunt for a Serial Killer, Jones changed his name to Harold Stevens and moved to Fulham, near Shepherd’s Bush – putting him in the area when the murders took place in  and . Prof Wilson also found a link between Jones and an industrial estate where police think bodies were kept before being dumped. There is also evidence he worked as a  beater, giving him access to paint found on four victims. And like Jack the Stripper, Prof Wilson presents evidence of Jones storing his victims’ bodies and having sadistic tendencies.  “These women were shysadistically murdered and because of that sadism – which had a sexual shyovertone – they lost their lives,” he said. “Sadism doesn’t dissipate over time, sadism always finds some way of expressing itself in terms of the killer’s le and lestyle. “There is an uncanny mirroring of these early murders in the s and how aspects are reappearing in those murders in the s.”Dark Son: The Hunt for a Serial Killer is on BBC at pm on Tuesday night and its available on BBC iPlayer now."},{"url":null,"title":"nurses tragic final message after","story":"NewsTragic nurses final message after being told SIX TIMES she didnt have cancerJulie O’Connor, , said her suffering was “disgusting” as shes propped up in her hospice bed three days before her deathShareCommentsByAndrew GilpinNeil Murphy:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news offline video husband-shares-emotional-video-dying-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA terminally-ill nurse used a heartbreaking final message to criticise the hospital she claims missed several chances todiagnose her cancer.

Dr Chris Burton, of North Bristol NHS Trust, said: “We are committed to understanding the full circumstances of the care we provided so we can improve our services. “We’ll be publicly open with the findings of the independent [probe] we’ve commissioned.” Last year Julie told the Bristol Post that in  was given the all clear, despite that result being wrong. Three years later, after what Julie describes as a “catalogue of errors”, her cancer spread out of control and became incurable.  “It’s too late now to cure me. I am having chemotherapy and radiotherapy but all they can do is give me palliative care to prolong my le,” Julie said back then. “If they had caught it back in  or even  it could’ve been a completely dferent story. “My main concern now is making sure that other women who had tests back in  and  are aware thatthey are having ongoing symptoms or think something is wrong they should challenge the results and get retested,” she added. Julie sued the hospital and going public with her story had been dficult for her family, especially her two children.  “But they understand that we are trying to help other women who might be given this devastating news,” she said. “The hospital are saying it is only me whose tests were wrong but they are reluctant to do a wider review of other smears even though we have pleaded with them to. “The last thing I want to do is put people off having smears, but just to question thingsyou are having symptoms like I was then challenge it and push it further,” she added.

Two men wearing balaclavas were caught on camera using a blow torch to burn off the locks on the front door of a family home in Bradford. Once inside they grabbed a set of car keys and stole a pound, Audi S Quattro - even using the torch to defrost the windscreen before driving off. Police say the technique is becoming increasingly common as thieves come up with new and unusual ways to break into properties. The latest incident, which happened at am in the morning, follows a spate of similar crimes across the north of England. Police believe criminals are targeting homes with PVC doors, melting the locks to gain entry to the property.   Taira Abdul-Khaliq, , who owns the car in the latest incident, said police had been unable to find any evidence at the scene due to the burnt out locks. She said: Im so angry, its unbelievable. Im off work at the moment because Im furious. Its a violation. They came in with blowtorches. I work in a local school and theres not many women who drive high-powered cars so lots of people know who I am. We were advised by police thatburglars break in, theyll come and wake you up for car keys and they might hurt you. So every night, we leave the keys on the stairs so they dont come and threaten us.   And thats exactly what they did, they searched our coats, stole our wallets and then started coming upstairs. Last April, police in Bradford warned of at least eight incidents where a blowtorch was used to gain access to a house. Other burglaries involving the flame-throwers have been reported in Sedgefield and Newton Ayclfe, County Durham, and Sutton-in-Craven and Crosshills, north Yorkshire and Keighley and Bingley, west Yorks. As the pair drove away, Tairas phone briefly connected with her cars dash cam and recorded the burglars comments as they realised the windscreen was iced up. Clearly unable to see, one of them can be heard saying: Lighter...get the lighter. Stick your head out of the window man! Teacher Taira added: Its just a few seconds but I can hear their voices and theyre local. Its so upsetting, it could be anyone I know. My neighbours CCTV captures them using the blowtorches down the road to defrost the windscreen.   I couldnt believe it when I saw it. That car was beautul. Everything I had I put into that car - I dont drink, smoke or go out clubbing. As long as I had my car, I was happy. It was a beauty, theres no car like it. My husband and I have been trying for children for a long time and I went for IVF. I had a horric experience where it went wrong and they found a cm polyp which they had to test for cancer. After that, when I received the all clear, I said to my husband that I was going to treat myself and this was my gt. Craven Inspector Geoff Crocker urged homeowners to update outdated locks and review their home security.   He said last year: I want to reassure the public that we are doing everything we can to apprehend the criminals who are committing these crimes. I would also recommend that residents review their home security arrangements and consider having snapsafe locks fitted to external doors front back and patio doors. Julie McCulloch, from Keighley, was one of those targeted last May. Thieves melted the door of her family home in a bid to steal her sons week-old Audi A. Although they left empty-handed, the -year-old said at the time: They are just horrible. Its awful. Im shaken up, but relieved they didnt get in.

However there are fears relatively strong winds could take the edge off those temperatures. High pressure over the continent this week is keeping things ‘fairly settled over the UK’.But by the weekend the Met Office have warned temperatures willto normal for this time of year - meaning more snow could be on the way. Met Officemeteorologist Sophie Yeomans told The Sun : “Through this week were seeing more settled weather because we’ve got high pressure and that’s bringing the air up from the south west and that’s bringing us the milder temperatures.“I think we could even go up to C in some of the days depending how cloudy it is. If we get some sunshine, we could see those highs in the south west of England.”  But it is not time to put the winter woolies away yet as forecasters fear another Beast from the East could batter the UK. At a similar time last year a severe weather system brought the country to a standstill with snow blocking roads, cutting off communities and cancelling flights. John Hammond from Weathertrending said: Southern and eastern areas are most prone to a continental chill from February , with an ongoing chance easterly winds will bring much colder air towards us. Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge told the Daily Star: “Weve certainly not had the last cold spell of winter.  “There are cold spells likely in the period from February  until March . “We may see snow to low levels with nights below zero, although its too early to say how low temperatures will go. “Spring might officially start on March  but theres still potential cold ahead even in March.” UK outlookOn Thursday, most will be dry, mild and sunny.

The bodies, discovered at Dabble Duck Industrial Park in Shildon, County Durham, were found near a Snoopy towel and a blue plastic bag. RSPCA inspector Clare Wilson said: “The business’ gates are locked overnight so either these puppies have been thrown over the surrounding wall and have spilled out of the bag and towel when they landed or they were dumped alive and crawled out.”According to Chronicle Live , she continued: All three puppies are newborn, brown and white and possibly Staffies. “Its unlikely three of the same litter died of natural causes at full-term so I suspect foul play or neglect. I want to find out where they came from so I can check on any remaining puppies and the mother dog. “If anyone knows of any puppies born on Wednesday or Thursday who have gone missing since, recognises the towel or saw anything they think might help my investigation please get in touch.” Anyone with any information should call the RSPCA inspector appeal line on    and ask to leave a message for Inspector Wilson.

Jovan Hill compares himself to reality TV stars the Kardashians with his online begging paying for a swish flat and all his bills. Earning five times the pound monthly salary he made working in a fast food restaurant, before quitting in January  to beg full-time, Jovan, , believes his money-making venture has also found him fame. Jovan, of Brooklyn, New York, USA, said: Im Twitter famous! It’s clear that Im providing my followers with a service and that’s why they give me money. There are some people who dont like what I do, but I think it’s more of a jealousy thing.Essentially, Im like the Kardashians – sitting on the couch moaning, throwing out a few jokes, but still getting paid. Sometimes I even get recognised in the street by my followers.   MaybeI looked dferent and wore a suit every day I would be on the Forbes list of the most successful businessmen of the year for coming up with this strategy.” Jovan fell into full-time begging after appealing to his followers - a fraction of the number he has now - in December  on the online live streaming service Periscope, telling them how work was driving him mad and asking them to pay him, which they did. Beforehand in March , he had been working in a fast food eatery, earning pound a month, but he loathed it. I had a few real jobs before what I do now, he explained. I was a health care assistant at an elderly peoples home while I was at college and, after that, I went to work at a fast food joint, when I dropped out. None of it felt like me and I hated it, so I asked my followers to give me money and they obliged! I couldnt believe it the first time I was given around pound. Concerned for her sons happiness, his mum, Veronica Hill, , a nurse, gave him some money, so he could move to New York to build a new le there.   Little did she know that he would find a lucrative career - as an apparent beggar. “Now that I have K followers that stretch all the way from the US to Singapore, my mum continues to be very supportive, said Jovan. I showed her my analytics. I get up to  million impressions a month - but it didn’t mean much to her. She’s still really happy for me, though. And while his dad, Christopher Robins, , who works in IT, could not understand how his son was making money at first, Jovan says he has now warmed to the idea. He laughed: At first, he didn’t understand it at all – but he’s starting to come around to the idea of what I do.” The secret to his success, according to Jovan, is his sparkling sense of humour. My tweets and live streams are very entertaining, he said. Its online comedy, so why shouldnt I be paid  When I was still working in the restaurant and went offline for a while, my followers missed me. I am providing a service and Millennials understand that entertainment and comedians arent just on TV or stages anymore - they can exist solely on Twitter, like me.   Although Jovan, who is gay, had been making people laugh online since dropping out of his political science course at Texas State University in early , when he first moved to New York, he had just k Twitter followers. But his amusing tweets about homosexuality and modern pop culture, soon saw his followers creeping up to k, alongside which money from his fans began steadily streaming into his Patreon account - a membership  for creators to run a subscription content service. While Jovan expected to make some money, he was astonished when he saw just how much cash he was raking in. He admitted: “The only thing I didn’t expect was the amount of money – I’m not rich or anything, but I make enough to live comfortably. “It just ended up working out for me. I asked my followers exactly what they wanted, so I could provide it and get paid in . “I also get donations while I’m on a live stream – where I chat to my fans about my day and theirs - which I usually do between three to four times a day for an hour or so. These pay for anything extra. The donations y, but sometimes people donate up to pound in one go.” But Jovan does not expect to be an online star forever and hopes that prospective employers will be keen to take him on, after seeing that he has the Midas touch and witnessing his online fame. Now living in Echo Park, LA, with the hope of following more stardom, Jovan explained: “I thought going into this that I might get hired as a social media manager since I had proved how good I was at it on my own account. “Half of what people follow me for is my commentary. I thought this would be useful for viral content and celebrities – and hoped I might be approached to tweet for other people. Instead, I’m still just tweeting for myself, so essentially, I have become my own social media manager. “But more brands and TV networks are starting to notice me and my online influence – so that might change in the future. Right now I don’t really take money from brands - I rely on my followers enjoying what I do and paying me for it.” Trolling is a persistent problem for Jovan, who admits that not everyone agrees with how he makes a living.   He said: “I get hate all the time and every day. Someone is always mad. At the end of the day, I’m still making my money and I’m fine. I don’t have to worry about them. My followers don’t give a s**t!” “People seem to think that me getting the money means a homeless person may not get it, but the fact is my followers aren’t going to give them money because they don’t care. They care about social media more. “And I dont overspend. I dont buy major luxuries and wouldn’t buy Gucci with my followers’ cash. I would feel weird doing that. If I had a brand deal with a designer I would, but otherwise, I wouldn’t.” Despite his success, Jovan does worry about the fact his le revolves around social media. He said: “Sometimes I think, Oh my god why did I ever start this – my le depends on this now and I can’t stop. I must constantly be online and constantly make sure people enjoy what I’m doing. It’s exhausting.   “So many people talk to me every day – it’s a lot more work than I imagined. I’m not complaining about it, but it can be tough sometimes. Regarding himself as an influencer on social media, he is keen to tell other young people not to take the whole phenomenon too seriously. He said: “My recommendation to other kids thinking about doing this is to please branch out your hobbies, too. Dont only do this. “I would say go and be the best you can be, andit happens and you become an influencer, it happens. Most people I know who have, fell into it by accident. Too many kids think they have to post a certain kind of way or look a certain kind of way – but they dont. Just enjoy yourself and do whatever makes you happy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"girl 20 weds zombie doll","story":"NewsGirl, , weds zombie doll called Kelly and is more intimate with love of her leFelicity Kadlec, , married zombie doll the Kelly Rossi, who she claims is  - with her other dolls at the ceremonyShareCommentsByMollie MansfieldAndrew Gilpin:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news weird-news video watch-wedding-video-girl-claims-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA girl who married her zombie doll says her world is now complete after their nupitals. Felicity Kadlec, , wed the love of her le Kelly Rossi, a zombie doll who she claims is -years-old, in front of her other dolls. The beautul ceremony, which took place in Tiverton, Rhode Island, USA, cost Felicity - covering her own wedding dress, a suit for Kelly and decorations for the outdoor venue. Alongside four of her family friends, eight of Felicitys other dolls also attended the ceremony to show their support in the ceremony six months ago. Felicity, who now lives in Vinita, Oklahoma, claims that marrying Kelly has made her feel closer and more intimate with her.   Felicity said: Our wedding ceremony was beautul and perfect - exactly the way I dreamed it would have been. I made sure that the whole wedding was done properly so it would be as official as possible, and we consummated the marriage afterwards. Kelly was the groom as she takes the male role in our relationship, she is a tom boy so wore a suit - I feel she was most comfortable as the groom. Despite having been in a relationship with Kelly for four years, getting married to her has made me feel so much closer to her, both emotionally and intimately.   Felicity was initially gted Kelly by her late father after becoming obsessed with horror movies and zombie dolls. She said: I found Kelly on a creepy doll collection website and my dad bought her for me when I was . It wasn’t until I was  years old that I started to get feelings for her, but it was something that I kept on trying to deny. When my father died last year, I found myself becoming closer and finding comfort in Kelly, as she was someone that he had bought for me. I finally allowed myself to be open with who I was and let my feelings come out and, despite not everyone agreeing with my love le, I have never felt happier.  When I started to feel more confident in my relationship, I knew I had to marry Kelly, but I waited until September as thats the same month as our birthdays so I knew it would be extra special. Despite Kellys zombie-like appearance, Felicity claims that she loves her doll deeply and wouldnt change her for the world. She said: I married Kelly but only because I accept her for who she is, I look past her bloody face and I dont mind her not having a jaw.  Also her spirit and personality traits made me know that she was the one for me and that I wanted to spend the rest of my le with her. To me, she is perfect, and I can feel that she loves me very deeply and I can sense her happiness since we have married. Just seeing her at the alter when I walked down the aisle was amazing, and to me she looked beautul. I am intimate with Kelly – I caress her and feel safe with her, and I feel a genuine connection when I’m having an intimate moment with her.

The SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, that launched last February, is now barreling through space with its dummy payload of the car and its “driver” beyond the orbit of Mars. However, there is said to be a “signicant possibility” it could crash into Venus or Earth. In a joint research paper, published under the title of The random walk of cars and their collision probabilities with planets, scientists predict Starman’s journey over the next few million years.They find that Earth, Venus and the Sun are the three most likely crash targets, thereported. Meanwhile, collisions with Mercury and Mars are the least likely outcome. And this is the same for Jupiter’s gravity catapulting the vehicle out of the solar system. However, there is no need to start panicking just yet asit does happen, it will not be for another million years. Orbital dynamics expert Professor Hanno Rein said: “Although we are not able to tell on which planet the car will ultimately end up, we’re comfortable saying it won’t survive in space for more than a few tens of millions of years.” The boffins said that Starman, the brainchild of billionaire entrepreneur Musk, will be closest to Earth within the first  years of its launch and to get an idea of distance, it will be was close as the Moon.

But unlike  million who entered the US through the famous New York gateway, those who reach Brownsville have been told they are not welcome. President Donald Trump wants to build a pound.billion wall to keep the refugees out and has viciously attacked the caravans that started in Mexico. However, a band of volunteers called Team Brownsville cannot watch the suffering and do nothing. They refuse to simply stand by. Every morning at am, the team’s founders Mike Benavides and Spanish-speaking partner Sergio Cordova greet people from the local detention centre to provide them with clothing, food and help with a bus ticketthey need it.  We visited Brownsville on the first day of a ,-mile drive along the entire US border with Mexico to meet those most affected on what could be both sides of Trump’s wall. It is the most easterly legal port of entry to the States on the border. As we walked with Team Brownsville’s Ann Finch, , from Austin, Texas, Sage McKee,  from Spokane, Washington, and Pam Hancock, , from Denton, Texas, we were waved through by Mexican border patrol.  We saw around  refugees waiting to be called by US authorities to begin their application for asylum. “It is shameful what the States has become under Trump,” says Sage. “A country built by immigrants turns their back on them.” Pam goes further. “Trump is a disgrace,” she storms.  “He has no empathy or compassion. You only need to listen to these people’s stories to understand what they have been through.” Migrants have been surging into Matamoros, just across the border and one of the most dangerous areas in the world thanks to drug cartel violence. Those lucky enough to make it past the gangs arrive at the crossing with the just the clothes on their backs. School administrator Mike says the group have helped around , migrants from more than  countries. Each applies for asylum andaccepted they are held in a detention centre until a sponsor is found.  If the application is successful, the sponsor pays a bond and they are dropped in Guantanamo Bay-type clothing at the local bus station. We meet Jacquelinne Jenner Puentes Aguilar, who says she would have been killedshe has stayed in El Congo in Santa Ana, El Salvador. Married for  years, raising her three children and her late sister’s son, the -year-old and her husband built up a small business selling clothes. But when gangster thugs learned of their modest success they demanded not only her earnings, but also her husband too.   She says: “My husband had to join the gang to save us from being slaughtered. But they still wanted money. When I told them I couldn’t pay they threatened to kill my children and me. “I couldn’t stay. I left my children with my parents and fled. “My husband is now in prison. I know I will never see him again.” Jacquelinne got to Mexico by foot and by bus. Once she made it into the country, she landed a job on a ranch but was held against her will before managing to escape.   Now, seven months after leaving her homeland, she is waiting to be processed into America’s asylum system, which could take  months. Lamin Jallow, , fled Brikama, The Gambia, after it emerged he had been secretly having an eight-year gay relationship and his boyfriend was killed. “Homosexuality is illegal in my country,” he says. “The punishment by the courts I could handle. The justice administered by the local community I could not. “I would be lynched like my boyfriend was before being killed. My father wanted me dead.” Lamin travelled through Senegal and managed to reach Ecuador, where he was granted a visa. After that expired, he set off north.   It took him a year and a half to walk to the US border, sleeping by day and travelling by night for safety. He is also waiting patiently at the border in Brownsville for his name to be called. Selfless Mike says he is hoping to take early retirement this year to dedicate himself full-time to the migrants. He says of those he has helped: “Despite what Trump would have the world believe, not one was near a bad person. It’s a lie. They are not rapists or killers or gang members.   “These people are young people who are running away from all that. They are pressured to join the gangs, andthey refuse their families are threatened or killed. “They merely want to live a le without violence and crime. “History will judge America for its treatment of migrants under Trump.” Trump is standing up for us — migrants cross my land daily  For Vietnam special forces veteran Bill Miller, the only man who can liberate what he sees as his under-seige community is Donald Trump. Miller, , proudly flies a flag dedicated to the President outside his home, in a warning sign to the hundreds of illegal migrants he claims walk through his land every week. He said: “Donald Trump is the only man standing up for us. “He is the most honest President this country has ever had, anda liberal stepped on my land, I’d shoot them. I have migrants coming across my land every day, all of them illegally. All there is now where I am is a fence. The wall needs to be built. “There people are bringing crime and disease to this country, and they need to be stopped.” Miller lives along Route , in the border village of Columbus, New Mexico. He is one of hundreds of locals who support Trump’s wall. Many have bought dogs for protection from migrants, while others erected fences along their properties. Columbus and nearby Hachita are the closest populated places to the Antelope Wells port of entry. A week ago, a group of  migrants were apprehended at the border crossing – the th group of  people or more since October. They come after the port of entry closes at pm, usually at night, and walk around the barriers. The Mirror found metal sheeting that migrants used to climb over the primitive barrier, just yards from the official crossing.  Dan Stalnaker, , who lives in Hachita, said immigration is a “cause for huge concern”. He said: “The migrants are taking a huge toll on the American taxpayer. Something needs to be done.” But Mike Sims, , says local Border Patrol agents think the wall is “the dumbest idea”. He added: “If an illegal migrant is determined enough, they’ll find a way to get around it. We need our border patrols to be given better resources.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sudan lost boy reveals horror","story":"NewsSudan Lost Boy reveals horror of seeing heads blown off as zombie child soldierEXCLUSIVE: Emmanuel Jal is lucky to have escaped, but figures released on Red Hand Day - International Day Against the Use of Child Soldiers - reveal around , children are still fighting warsShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  FEB NewsEmmanuel Jal has spoken of the horrors of experiencing war as a child soldier \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs a child Emmanuel Jal lived through more horrors than anyone should endure in a letime. When he was just , armed with a gun he could barely carry, and in the midst of a war which had claimed the lives of hundreds of his friends and relatives, he decided he could take no more. In extreme pain from an injury hed suffered in combat, and having just witnessed another boy his age take his own le, he turned the gun on himself. Thankfully and incredibly the weapon didnt fire - and he now believes he was destined to live to tell his story, to stop others being robbed of their childhood like he was. Talking about the incident for the first time, he revealed how bleak le was as a child soldier. Emmanuel was one of Sudans Lost Boys - children whose homes were destroyed and families torn apart by the countrys brutal civil war. Angry about the burning of his village and the murder of his mother, he was a prime target for militiamen in desperate need of recruits.  He was just seven when he pledged to fight for the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army , and immediately began training to be a killer. Now aged  and a father of three, he is determined to do everything he can to prevent others losing their childhood the way he did. Tragically it is a situation that continues to this day, with the UN estimating there are around , children fighting in armed groups across the world. Today - February  - is International Day Against the Use of Child Soldiers, better known as Red Hand Day, with campaigners around the world calling for this recruitment to end. Speaking from his home in Toronto, Canada, Emmanuel said: We went through hell. Imagine being seven years old and going onto a battlefield.  I saw heads being blown off, people dying everywhere, we were like zombies. There were always people screaming for help. After four years, it appeared all hope had been lost, until a jammed weapon transformed his le forever. He said: In one place I lost hope. Fty metres away there was a boy who shot himself in the head, he took his own le. I wanted to do the same, I had pain in my foot and I looked at my past, present and future and did not see any hope. I cocked my gun and I fired, but no bullet came out, the gun failed. Its a story that I never wanted to tell anyone before now. But at that moment when the bullet failed, I believed I survived for a reason.  I saw how my le had been as a kid, and I wanted to be part of the solution. More than a decade ago, a book and documentary about his le, both named War Child, introduced him to audiences around the world, and made him a symbol of the crisis in his homeland. He has also found success as a musician, with his material drawing from his own experience to spread messages of peace. Hollywood fame followed too, when he was cast as a Lost Boy in  movie The Good Lie, alongside A-lister Reese Witherspoon. It is far beyond the dreams Emmanuel had when he finally decided to flee the le of violence. As a young child, he grew up in a village named Tonj in what is now South Sudan.  He remembers his early years as being comfortable, but everything changed when Tonj was attacked by pro-government troops. He and his siblings were separated from his mother, who he never saw again. With his homeland no longer safe, Emmanuel was taken to Ethiopia, where he was recruited to fight for the SPLA in a refugee camp. I wanted revenge, I wanted to kill as many Arabs and Muslims as I could, he recounted. When they give you an AK you feel powerful. Violence is addictive, thats why it keeps pulling people back. It haunts you for a letime. Its like murder of the soul. Emmanuel is frank about the violence he and his comrades inflicted on other innocents during the war.  On one unauthorised operation in Ethiopia, young soldiers ransacked a village, similar to his own. And on another occasion he and around five others brutally beat a person to death. He does not know whether he killed anyone  in battle, because he would fire blindly and indiscriminately toward the enemy, unawarehis bullets had found their targets. We were trained soldiers, he said. Im one of the iniduals that played a part in burning that village down, people were killed. We werent held accountable. Young people can be programmed to do these things, war is all they know. In spite of the trauma he experienced, Emmanuel refuses to view his recruiters as evil, instead describing them as a product of their surroundings.  The place for a child is in school, he said. Children should not have to fight. But a genocide was happening, it was war. Where do you run that is better  If I didnt fight, I would probably be dead.There is no alternative. The only way to prevent it is to prevent the war from actually happening. But with many of the current political leaders in South Sudan and Sudan having themselves been child soldiers, Emmanuel fears the cycle of recruitment and violence will continue. He admits he was lucky. Had he not decided to run away, and been smuggled into Kenya by a sympathetic aid worker, he believes he would either be dead, or still fighting. Id either be a soldier or Id have been killed, he said thoughtfully. He and a group of around  children decided to flee when the violence became unbearable.  Just a handful, including Emmanuel, made it to the town of Waat, in what is now South Sudan. There he met British aid worker Emma McCune, who was married to a senior SPLA leader. Determined to ensure Emmanuel did not have toto the battlefield, McCune - who tragically died a few months later in a car crash - smuggled him to Nairobi in Kenya. There he was able to continue his schooling, and his outlook on le began to change.I am an ex-child soldier who used to hate Muslims, he said. Now I dont hate anyone, my experience has shown me we can co-exist. In  he collaborated with a Sudanese Muslim artist, Abdel Gadir Salim, to make an album called Ceasefire.  Music is powerful, it gives you a voice and I got to become a champion at it, Emmanuel stated. With acclaim came interest from around the world, and he was one of the artists picked to perform at Nelson Mandelas th birthday celebrations in Hyde Park in . That was incredible, he recalled. From Kenya he lived in London from  to , before moving to his current home in Canada. Throughout much of his horric ordeal as a child soldier, he had no idea whether his family had survived. It was only in  that he reunited with younger sister Nyaruach, who had herself seen those around her brutally killed, and suffered horrying assaults by government officials. Now they have recorded an album together, named Naath, and plan to perform in Europe over the summer. Nyaruach is currently living in a refugee camp in Kenya, one of around two million people displaced by Sudans destructive civil war. When you come from a survival state you are super creative, Emmanuel said. This is a  for us to share our message. There is always hope.  Sadly hope is still something denied to thousands of children forced to fight.Military recruitment of children is gradually being outlawed, but  countries still allow it, charity War Child reveals - and the armed forces of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen are known to include child combatants. A report published by the UN last year warned that many combat groups sell children to raise funds.It said: Rape and other forms of sexual violence are also very clearly linked to trafficking and to the sale of children, as armed groups often traffic children for sexual purposes and sometimes use sales to sustain their activities financially. War Child has warned that support available to former combatants falls well short of what is needed. A spokeswoman said: For children who’ve been in armed groups much of the structure of the humanitarian system is set to fail them. Every child associated or formally associated with an armed group will have unique needs – there’s no one size fits all.It takes time and dedicated specialist care to help each child come to terms with their experiences and to really understand what the challenges are to them realising their future. For some children ing to education doesn’t feel like an option – having missed years of school they don’t want to go back into the classroom with children who are much younger than them – in these cases training into a viable livelihood is the most important skill they can gain.There needs to be a more holistic response for children who’ve left armed groups. At times the stigma faced by them leads them to being excluded from their communities and this can be a factor that contributed to children re-joining armed groups.It’s important to work with whole communities, not just the children who’ve been in groups, to ensure that children are seen as victims not perpetrators and able to get the help they need to overcome their experiences."},{"url":null,"title":"boost for dundee united as skipper st mirren skipper mcginn ruled out","story":"St Mirren captain Stephen McGinn is set to miss Saturday’s Scottish Cup last- clash with Dundee United.The -year-old went off with a hamstring injury as the Buddies fell three points adrt at the bottom of the Premiership with a - defeat to Motherwell on Wednesday night.“We checked him out and the hamstring is still quite sore,” boss Oran Kearney said. “It’s early days.

school meals and the establishment of the Scottish Welfare Fund are all commendable.However, as I sat in the public chamber at the Scottish Parliament for the budget address last week, it struck me as unremarkable.Mr Mackay promised “certainty and stability for Scotland” in the face of “a UK Government engaging in systematic damage of our economy”.There was crucial investment in local government, healthcare provision and affordable housing, as well as education, but no reference to any of the investment requests made by the Scottish Unemployed Workers’ Network.It was also a window into the state of politics in Scotland.Apart from the poor concessions secured by the Scottish Greens, there were embarrassing Doctor Who analogies from the Scottish Conservatives, a pitul defence of a decision not to invest £, to lt , children out of poverty from a former social security minister and another cabinet member who, at one point, laughed so hard she fell off her seat.I think most will understand a degree of fiscal caution on the eve of Brexit but what felt more distressing than the lack of investment in efforts to alleviate poverty was a poverty of political vision for Scotland.I caught up with Sarah for her post-budget reflections and she said simply: “The SNP are taking for granted the support of the working-class people of Scotland.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c618d3fd71d19.42056380.jpg ","title":"generous dundee asda customers raise 500 for archie

good","story":"There’s a fresh look about Dundee these days after manager Jim McIntyre made sweeping changes to his squad over January.Eleven new players came in – enough to make up a whole new team – as the Dark Blues look for a way out of the relegation mire they’ve found themselves in.Ten of the  have already made their debuts and today the Tele will have a look at what they’ve shown and what might be to come.Seny DiengIt’s not all been plain sailing for the Swiss goalie after his mis-cued clearance led to Hamilton’s equaliser at the weekend but he’s been an assured presence overall between the sticks.On loan from QPR, the -year-old is still learning his trade but he’s made some vital stops already and commands his area well. Kicking could do with improving, however.James HorsfieldAnother loanee, -year-old Horsfield is eager for game time after not featuring much for Scunthorpe this season.The former Man City kid, who has trained under Pep Guardiola, Manuel Pellegrini and Patrick Vieira, has shown a steady start at right-back both with the ball and defensively.Ryan McGowanThe Australian international has slotted in no problem at all and immediately strengthened the Dundee backline.Two strong performances already at centre-back, once he gets more settled there’s more to come.Andrew DaviesThe former Ross County skipper hasn’t had much luck in his time at Dens, breaking his foot in his first bounce game after signing.Injuries have been a feature of his career but all reports of his time in the Highlands and down south suggest, when he’s fit, he’s a strong leader at the back.Andreas HadeniusNot much was known about the big Swede before he signed for the Dark Blues just over a fortnight ago.We still don’t know too much but he’s shown in his two starts so far that he’s a ball-winner in the middle of the park who keeps possession ticking over.Ethan RobsonParent club Sunderland rate this kid highly and Jim McIntyre admitted he was surprised to be able to get the midfielder in on loan.His debut at Hamilton on Saturday largely passed him by before picking up a groin issue that kept him out of the - draw at Kilmarnock.Once up to speed, the hope is Robson can begin to realise the potential plenty down south recognise.John O’SullivanAnother loanee largely unknown up here, O’Sullivan made a fleeting debut at New Douglas Park last weekend.Andy DalesThe winger has made an impressive start to le up here. His direct, pacy running has caused defences plenty of problems but his final ball looks certain to frustrate Dees.Exciting player, though, and an asset to the team.Scott WrightThe talented forward hasn’t been able to push his way into Derek McInnes’ first team at Aberdeen yet and has joined Dundee to prove himself at this level.He’s fast becoming a favourite at Dens after a super goal at Hamilton and an impressive first-half showing against Kilmarnock.Craig CurranA frontman Jim McIntyre knows very well from his time at Ross County, Curran has shown he’ll work tirelessly and keep defenders honest. A tidy knock-down for the opening goal against Killie, too. More of that and the Dark Blues will be happy.Andrew NelsonWe were told the young striker was raw but full of talent and he’s shown that already. Three goals in five appearances have rocketed him to second-top scorer already this season but even when not scoring he gives defences a real headache.Will need support but already looks a real find."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c618d7d5cf133.42034458.jpg ","title":"innocent dundee dad may take legal action after cops batter down his door and handcuff him","story":"A Lochee dad is considering legal action after police forced their way into his home and put him in handcuffs in a case of mistaken identity.Andrew Alexander, , was enjoying an evening in with his son Drew, , when police entered his Kirk Street house.Officers in riot gear “battered” his door in and said they had a warrant to arrest a man with the same name, in connection with alleged firearms offences.However, it soon emerged they were targeting the wrong person. vw, px\"  Mr Alexander has received an apology from Police Scotland since September’s incident – but is unhappy at how it was handled.He said: “It happened late on a Saturday night.“I heard them battering down the door.“The door hadn’t opened and I said I would open it for them.“There were eight officers, some of them in riot gear.“They came in and showed me a warrant to search the premises for suspected firearms.“It was quickly flashed in my face and it said that Andrew Alexander was concerned in firearms.“I was immediately put in handcuffs and my hands were placed behind my back.”Mr Alexander said it was the second time in eight years he had been mistaken for a criminal.He added: “My son was taken into another room while officers carried out a search of the premises.

It’s one that could leave Keyes and Dundee-based managing director, John Nelms, less than impressed,not surprised.They’ve previously stated the proposed increase in shareholding would have resulted in major tax benefits as they press ahead with the planned Camperdown move.As they informed members and the club of their decision, the society expressed the opinion they’re acting “in the best interests of the society as a whole”. And while they are generally supportive of Tim Keyes, they know he will not be Dundee owner forever."},{"url":null,"title":"striker osman sow could make first dundee united start against st

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

Alan McConnell, , admitted the offence when he appeared in Ayr Sherf Court. McConnell was drinking at home with his partner on December  last year. But at some point he left the address, in Prestwick’s Raith Avenue, said depute fiscal Lindzi Bayne. His partner went looking for him at a nearby corner shop, but he had driven off so shop staff contacted police. McConnell’s car was traced to Drongan, and he admitted he had driven there. The charge against him stated he drove on roads between Raith Avenue, Prestwick and Coronation Road, Drongan. A breath test revealed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath. The legal limit in Scotland is  microgrammes. The court heard that McConnell had been ‘just over’ the limit in an earlier drink-driving conviction. Defence lawyer John Gallagher said his client was well aware he could be sent to jail this time. However, he made a plea for a sentence of unpaid work on his client, now of Lane Crescent, Drongan. Sherf John Montgomery told McConnell: “You were driving at five times over the prescribed limit. “If you ever offend again like this, it is inevitable you are going to jail.” He imposed a four-year-driving ban on McConnell, and ordered him to do  hours of unpaid work in the community, within six months. There was another crumb of comfort for McConnell when the sherf refused a Crown motion to seize his car, worth pound.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrCourtsAlcoholDrink-drivingJusticePrestwickAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"retired girvan bank boss admits","story":"NewsRetired Girvan bank boss admits drink-driving offencesNeighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsWilliam Fairbairn is disqualied from the roads for three years\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA retired bank manager was lucky not to be jailed after admitting two drink-driving offences. Neighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Sherf John Montgomery told him: “That would normally mean a custodial sentence. I note your previously unblemished record.” The sherf instead imposed a fine of pound on Fairbairn, and banned him from driving for three years. Depute fiscal Lynda Carnochan described how an anonymous person phoned police on Tuesday afternoon, August , , around .pm. An hour later, police traced a blue Audi car to Rodney Drive in Girvan, and Fairbairn was still in the vehicle. His speech was slurred, said Ms Carnochan. But due to health problems, he struggled to give a breath test.   However, a blood test revealed he had  milligrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of blood, when the legal limit is  milligrammes. Just two months later, on October , , police on mobile patrol saw Fairbairn driving a Vauxhall Corsa. “They were aware of anonymous reports that he was driving while drinking,” said Ms Carnochan. “They followed him into The Avenue, but he did not stop when police flashed lights at him. He then turned into Rodney Drive, and drove past his own address. However he was eventually stopped.” A breath test was this time successful on Fairbairn. And iot showed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath when the legal limit is  microgrammes. Solicitor Hugh Duncan said Fairbairn had retired from the Bank of Scotland in  on a pension of pound per week.   He used his car to visit his -year-old mother, who is resident in a care home, added the lawyer. “The second matter, within such a short space of time, shows there is an issue with alcohol,” Mr Duncan admitted. “His we tells me his drinking is being curtailed. He was hospitalised with a gallstone, and he suffers from COPD.” Sherf Montgomery fined Fairbairn pound on the first charge, with a  months disqualication. He added an pound fine and a three-year disqualication on the second charge. Fairbairn, of Rodney Drive in Girvan, agreed to pay the pound total within  days. His disqualications will run concurrently, making a total of three years, but the Crown made no move to seize the family cars.

Like the review, we believe in strong local journalism and have been looking at how best to develop the work we have begun with the industry and will have more to say in the near future, a BBC spokesman said.ldquoHowever, there is no evidence of the BBC crowding out other providers. This was looked at extensively during Charter review.

We look forward to working with them on meaningful and high-impact solutions that will support the incredibly important role that local publishers and their public interest journalism fulfils in communities across theand breadth of the UK.Labour deputy leader and shadow culture secretary Tom Watson also said that criticism of the BBC was misplaced.ldquoDame Frances has adopted a number of Labourrsquos policies, such as tax reliefs for public service journalism, but attacking the BBC is barking up the wrong tree, he said.ldquoWhile she has recommended an inquiry into BBC News Online, the real fundamental problem that the government must now deal with is the duopoly in the digital advertising market, with over half of all revenues going to Facebook and Google.ldquoAs long as tech giants continue to completely dominate the market itrsquos dficult to see how a sustainable financial footing for journalism can be achieved.Google spokesman Richard Gingras said: ldquoWe are

books has ldquono credibility and should be abandoned, MPs have said.After last yearrsquos Budget delivered a massive spending boost to the NHS, the cross-party Commons Treasury Committee said it was clear it was no longer Government policy to aim to run a surplus.The committee dismissed Mr Hammondrsquos claim the UK could look forward to a ldquodeal idendthe Government reached agreement with Brussels and avoided a ldquodisorderly no-deal Brexit.Nicky Morgan has said the Chancellorrsquos definition of ending austerity is lsquoimprecisersquo It also poured cold water on his assertion that the era of austerity was ldquocoming to an end, saying his definition of what that meant was ldquoexpansive but also imprecise.The current stated aim of Government policy is tothe public finances to balance at ldquothe earliest possible date in the next Parliament.The committee said the Chancellor would have remained on course to achieve that without any fiscal ldquotightening ndash cutting spending or raising taxes ndash in the Budget in October.Instead he opted for the ldquolargest discretionary fiscal loosening at any fiscal event since the Tories came to power in , with a pound billion-a-year cash injection for the NHS.In evidence to the committee, Mr Hammond said he believed the best way to reduce the public debt to GDP ratio was to boost economic growth rather than running a budget surplus.ldquoGiven that the Chancellor both appears to be disregarding the fiscal objective and has told the committee it is not the best way of reducing the public debt, it is now clear that the fiscal objective now has no credibility, so it cannot be used by Parliament to hold the Government to account, the committee said.ldquoThe committee recommends that it be replaced before the next Budget with something that accurately reflects Government policy and priorities, which clearly do not include running a budget surplus.The committee also rejected Mr Hammondrsquos claim there would be a Brexit ldquodeal idendthe Government secured an agreement with Brussels, saying the assumption there would be an ldquoorderly transition was already built into the Office for Budget Responsibilityrsquos forecasts.ldquoBeyond this, there could be some improvement to business confidence and investment following an orderly transition or a resolution of Brexit-related uncertainty that is not currently forecast by the OBR.ldquoIt is not credible that this be described as a idend, it said.The committee also questioned Mr Hammondrsquos argument that a combination of more generous funding of public services, real wage growth and a lower proportion of income going into taxation meant the ldquoera of austerity was ending.The committee chairwoman Nicky Morgan said:ldquoClaims by the Chancellor that austerity is coming to an end are expansive and imprecise.ldquoHe should set out what he means in more measurable terms, especially as he will face more dficult choices at future budgets for how to fund such a pledge.A Treasury spokesman said: ldquoRestoring the public finances to health is a result of good economic management, not luck.ldquoDebt is now falling on a sustained basis for the first time in a generation, wages are growing at their fastest rate in over a decade, and todayrsquos GDP data confirmed that the UK economy grew for a ninth consecutive year.Labour Treasury spokesman Peter Dowd said:ldquoThis cross-party committee of MPs has shone a light on the Governmentrsquos  promises and economic fictions.

The board has certainly had a thorough look through it and as a matter of record we should appreciate it.#One thing that has caused frustration at previous meetings has been the dficulty in reading some of the financial papers.#This doesn’t change the overall picture, which is not a good one, but when you see it like this, it is easier.#The key things I take out will be the grip and control actions that the board are approving today.#As Kirsty says, this is not just a one-week wonder – this is a continuous process to help improve the financial position.#Although the outlook is not good there is a positive in that we have a better transparency and now that we have the grip and control we can look to move forward and see what dference it makes.#At the meeting, Ms Flanagan explained why an overspend is projected when the HSCP is currently operating at an underspend of just more than £,.The HSCP, run jointly by the council and NHS Highland, may face even further financial woean agreement is not reached with NHSGGC.Ms Flanagan said: #The finances within the dferent organisations are managed dferently.

The focus of attention needs to be on the full year position, so reporting an overspend of £.m is a deterioration on where we were at our November meeting.#The main reason for this is dficulty in delivering over £m worth of savings. There also remains a risk to the out turn in the SLA with NHSGGC.#The board made the decision at the November meeting to reject the agreement and the overspend has been adjusted to reflect this.#If this position is not accepted by NHSGGC, the overspend could increase by up to £.m.#Cllr Mulvaney then proposed that a repayment plan from the HSCP to the council is deferred by a year.This involves the authority being repaid any loss made by the HSCP over a three-year period, with £, due in the first financial year, £, in the second financial year, and the balance in year three.Ms Flanagan said: #We should seek clarication but I think that would be a reasonable request.#It was also advised that a job description has been finalised for a permanent head of finance with the HSCP and should be advertised soon."},{"url":null,"title":"bus fare payments to go contactless","story":"Nearly half a million pounds has been awarded in the first round of the fund to help firms cope with the costs of upgrading ticket machines to accept contactless bank payments.The cash has been awarded from the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund.It is estimated to provide a contactless payment solution to potentially . million fare paying journeys right across Scotland.The fund builds on the successful rollout of contactless payment by the country’s largest operators and responds to feedback from smaller operators around the financial barriers to upgrading.The Scottish Government’s vision is that all journeys on Scotland’s public transport networks can be made using some form of smart ticketing or payment by spring .Commenting on the first awards, cabinet secretary for transport, Michael Matheson said: #Contactless payments make it easier to access travel in Scotland and I am delighted we have been able to support up to  smaller operators in making the transition to this convenient payment solution.#This government is committed to supporting the industry and also people right across the country who choose to travel by bus.#By helping smaller operators with the financial costs of upgrading to contactless payment, customers will benefit from quicker and easier transactions, whether by card or by mobile phone.#A second round of the fund hasl opened and we are widening this fund out to all operators, so that even more organisations can take advantage of the support on offer.#Keith Shand, Assistant Operations Manager at Garelochhead Mini Bus and Coaches, said: #Modern day society expects to board a bus and not have to carry the correct change.#Feedback from our customers shows  per cent have indicated they would use contactless payments on our buses and we’re delighted that we will now be able to deliver this service.#The Courier emailed West Coast Motors for a comment but no-one responded."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files february 8 2019","story":"Natasha turns up the heatAlthough narrowly beaten in the Highlands and Islands regional final, Natasha Lee impressed a  of hospitality judges in Inverness.The Campbeltown Grammar School pupil, aged , beat off stf competition to win a place at Inverness for the UK-wide Springboard FutureChef  cookery competition.Natasha with her certicate and regional finalist plate.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Government reached agreement with Brussels and avoided a ldquodisorderly no-deal Brexit.It also poured cold water on his assertion that the era of austerity was ldquocoming to an end, saying his definition of what that meant was ldquoexpansive but also imprecise.The current stated aim of Government policy is tothe public finances to balance at ldquothe earliest possible date in the next

October.Instead he opted for the ldquolargest discretionary fiscal loosening at any fiscal event since the Tories came to power in , with a pound billion-a-year cash injection for the NHS.In evidence to the committee, Mr Hammond said he believed the best way to reduce the public debt to GDP ratio was to boost economic growth rather than running a budget surplus.ldquoGiven that the Chancellor both appears to be disregarding the fiscal objective and has told the committee it is not the best way of reducing the public debt, it is now clear that the fiscal objective now has no credibility, so it cannot be used by Parliament to hold the Government to account, the committee said.ldquoThe committee recommends that it be replaced before the next Budget with something that accurately reflects

He effectively dropped his opposition to her Withdrawal Agreement, which Labour had repeatedly condemned as the ldquoworst of all worlds. The Labour leaderrsquos letter still calls for a customs union, regulatory alignment on trade and guarantees on workers rights and security cooperation. But, crucially, Labour is no longer holding to the ldquosix tests, and insisting a Brexit deal should deliver ldquoexactly the same benefits as being in the single market.Labour has even dropped its opposition to the Irish backstop, which Mr Corbyn condemned, as recently as December, for leaving Britain ldquoin an indefinite halfway house with no say on its future. The explanatory note that Labour circulated after the leaderrsquos letter to May is quite clear. ldquoAny withdrawal agreement,\" it says, ldquowill need to include a backstop.\" Labour is also hinting at further compromises in ldquonegotiations.Hitherto, Labourrsquos policy has been to make demands May could never accept now they are trying to make her an offer she canrsquot refuse.So at last, after months of there being nothing much new to say about Brexit, suddenly we have what looks like a breakthrough, a historic compromise. Of course, you canrsquot overestimate the ability of political leaders to look a gt horse in the mouth. Theresa May may be so wedded to being a ldquobloody dficult womanthat she may find a way to avoid accepting Labourrsquos free hooved mammal. But the deal is there to be made.Senior Tories like Sir Oliver Letwin have welcomed the Labour offer, seeing it as a step towards a Norway-style agreement, even though it isnrsquot. Labourrsquos plan is much closer to Turkey, which is also in a customs union and accepts regulatory alignment. Brussels likes Corbyns proposals too, as a way out of hard Brexit ldquohell.Ive argued that the logic of Labourrsquos position was always to back something resembling Theresa Mayrsquos deal with the EU. It corresponds to Labourrsquos manesto commitments to leaving the EU, including the single market, and ending free movement while seeking frictionless trade. Mrs May has always supported regulatory alignment, since the ldquocommon rule book in her Chequers plan. And the backstop, remember, involves the UK remaining in the customs union until there is a future comprehensive trade deal.In what could almost have been a coordinated intervention last week, Mrs May restated in Dublin her determination to prevent a hard border in Ireland. This put the wind up the DUP, since they fear that the border might now move to the Irish Sea.It didnrsquot appeal to the hardline Brexiteers in her own party either, who are adamant that no deal is better than her bad deal. They thought it had been killed off by last monthrsquos record-breaking Commons defeat ndash but it may now live again with Labourrsquos backing.They canrsquot admit it, of course, but May and Corbyn are now speaking broadly the same language. The customs union, regulatory alignment, rights and protections etc are all matters to do with the future trade relationship with the EU, not the Withdrawal Agreement. It covers only money, citizenship and the Good Friday Agreement.The trading relationship can only be negotiated after Brexit. It is to be hammered out within the up to four years of the transition period, during which the UK remains in the single market and the customs union.Onlythere is no agreement does the backstop comes into play, and that really just extends the transition period indefinitely. May has said she will get assurances that the backstop will be time-limited, but she canrsquot get that from the European Union. If it was limited, it would no longer be a backstop.What hard Brexiteers really fear is that the transition period might lead to a soft Brexit, not a clean break ndash and they are right. What we know is that MPs will block any no-deal Brexit. Hardliners face a choice of May Corbyn or no Brexit at all.To secure a Commons majority without them, Mrs May could promise legislation to keep Britain in regulatory alignment with the customs union until a new trade deal is finalised ndash one which delivers the same benefits. This is anyway implicit in her promises to keep trade ldquofrictionless. Indeed, remaining in a customs union is the only way of achieving this. Up to now, she hasnrsquot been able to say this openly for fear of a rebellion by her hardline backbenchers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. They want a managed no-deal now, or in four years, under the so-called ldquoMalthouse Plan.Butshe has an ounce of political sense, May will now face them down and pivot to Labourrsquos softish Brexit. Labourrsquos demand that she put the customs union in primary legislation can be finessed, because the trade negotiations canrsquot happen until after Brexit. She doesnrsquot even need to ensure that Labour votes with her. Labour could abstain in the meaningful vote and achieve essentially the same result. The DUP would accept the customs union as a guarantee against a backstop or an east west hard border.Jeremy Corbyn could explain Labourrsquos abstention, which will be attacked by Vote Leave MPs andleader writers, by saying, as his spokespeople did last week: that the top priority ldquofor the nation is to avoid a no-deal. Corbynite commentators can be relied upon to condemn any Labour MPs who continue to vote against Mayrsquos deal as traitors. Unreconstructed Blairites, voting with the hated Moggists to force a no-deal disaster.Corbynrsquos letter made no reference to a Peoples Vote. Remainers in the Labour Party realise where all this is heading, which is why a number, like former shadow cabinet figures like Owen Smith, and Clive Lewis, have threatened to leave the party. That could become part of the script.Corbyn has used the Brexit issue to smoke out Blairite Remainers like Chuka Umunna, and the Jewish MP, Luciana Berger, in order to portray them as disloyal splitters.Of course, ordinary members of the Labour Party will be mightily confused. Many of them still think Labour is committed to a referendum. It still could come to that, of course,May doesnrsquot seize this opportunity.I still harbour vague hopes that A could be revoked, but Irsquom afraid that pro-Europeans are on the wrong side of history right now. The country is destined to leave the EU, because letrsquos face it, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is and has always been a pro-Brexit party.And after Brexit Day  Well, get ready for Groundhog Day  as negotiations over the future EU trade deal begin all over again."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-push-to-end-brexit-delay","story":"Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said his party will use a Commons amendment this week to make the Prime Minister hold another ldquomeaningful vote by February .He said he wanted to stop her ldquocynical and ldquoreckless plan to run down the clock before March  then present MPs with a stark last-minute choice between her deal and no-deal.There is a suspicion Mrs May wants to wait until after a summit of EU leaders on March .Labourrsquos move prompted Number  to offer MPs another vote on Brexit options by the end of the month, but only a non-binding one.Business leaders attacked the uncertainty and said it was making no-deal more likely.

That means that public transport needs to be reliable, comfortable and regular.ldquoI would like to see ScotRail invest more signicantly on this line, and capitalise on the clear growth in tourism the area is experiencing.

That someone should be a member of the audience on dferent occasions should surprise no one, as the main concern of the producers is viewing figures, and these are boosted by having controversy, not by providing information.On the issue of bias, it is, sadly, there and seems part of the ethos of the programme. On Question Time a few days before the EU referendum, both David Dimbleby and Chris Grayling were out of their chairs to correct a lady who referred to \"English values\", pointing out that the said values were in reality \"British\". This political correctness did not long survive the vote, and not one on the  a few weeks later corrected an audience member who referred to \"English industry and trade\".Having watched the decline in standards over the past  months, I have decided not to waste my time watching Question Time. If I want to hear a reasoned and intelligent political discussion, I will ask a group of teenagers their opinion.T J Dowds,q Fleming Road, Cumbernauld.I NOTE with interest Mark Smiths article. I have thought for some time that Question Time has lost its way and that we no longer are presented with considered debate from reasonably informed members of the public. It seems to be a perpetual shouting joust from hand-picked members of the public. Last weeks episode was the prime example, no proper debate. I find now, and have done for some time, that I can only tolerate about half the programme before retiring with a good work of fiction.On Thursday evening the five members of the audience who were invited to participate, before I switched off and went to bed, were all vehemently opposed to the SNP, including as Mr Smith pointed, out one who was a Ukip member of the Orange Lodge, entitled to his opinion, however unchallenged in the \"debate\".In his last few years I felt David Dimbleby had lost control and Fiona Bruce, his replacement, whom I admire as a newsreader and presenter, lacks the incisive qualities of, for example, Emily Maitlis, who has proved on Newsnight she has the ability.The same  participants also seem to appear every few weeks asthe BBC has a limited pool of participants. Time for the BBC to review where this once-great programme is heading, or has the Brexit issue finally brought it to the point of no recovery Wallace Milligan, Juniper Green, Masonhill, Ayr.MARK Smithrsquos assessment of the BBCrsquos Question Time in Motherwell was charitable indeed. He gives the BBC the benefit of the doubt after allowing a known Ukip activist his fourth opportunity to shout at the SNP on the programme. This love-in between the BBC and Ukip has been longstanding, given the number of appearances Nigel Farage has had on the programme in recent years.The continued and sustained lack of SNP politicians appearing despite being the third largest party at Westminster compares badly with the treatment of the Liberal Democrats when they were in an identical parliamentary position. The truth is that the BBC has failed in its service to Scotland. The pound million Scotlandrsquos licence fee payers send south should instead be used to fund a new BBC Scotland, with complete editorial independence from the BBC in London. Before anyone complains that this would provide a poor service given a budget of this size, please be aware that Irelandrsquos BBC, which is known as RTE, spent eurom Ein .The New BBC Scotland would have at least the same spending power as RTE.Francis Buchan, Drybrough Crescent, Edinburgh.LAST Thursday on BBC Question Time from Motherwell, a serial audience member, former Ukip candidate Billy Mitchell, popped up in his favourite orange jerkin for his fourth appearance in so many years. This is a breach of the QT rules. A stooshie ensued on social media. Was he a far right plant by a Unionist-leaning editorial team, or had he sneaked in because of a flawed vetting procedure  I made it clear I thought cock-up, not conspiracy was the answer.That didnrsquot stop Mark Smith weighing in yesterday, writing a piece in which he described my position ndash that is, rejecting a conspiracy ndash as ldquocrappy, conspiratorial Da Vinci Code thinking. I know, surreal.Mr Smith also had an eccentric take on Mr Mitchellrsquos choice of orange jacket it was no more signicant than SNP list Fiona Hysloprsquos blue jacket. However a wee bit of googling would have alerted him to the fact that Mr Mitchell is a supporter of Ulster Young Militants, and calls himself \"orange jacket man\" on Facebook. So I donrsquot think itrsquos unreasonable to assume that his choice of jacket was a self-conscious sartorial nod.Why does it all matter  Well because Question Time producers say they have clear rules be up front about who you are when you apply to be on the programme, no repeat audience appearances, and politicians arenrsquot allowed to take cover in the audience ndash their place is on the  where they can be identied and their views subjected to scrutiny. Thatrsquos something surely we can all agree on John Nicolson,Presenter, TalkRadio, Hatfields, LondonAS they always do when theyre found out, Nationalists are claiming the Question Time audience was rigged and looking for dirt on Billy Mitchell.

as its predecessor. As part of the build, the project team used the opportunity to improve facilities in the village by redeveloping a derelict tennis court and constructing an enclosed children’s play park as well as additional parking for use by the school and local community.The school’s social staircase is already becoming a well-used architectural feature alongside its many other bright and airy flexible learning spaces, including the glass fronted library and learning area upstairs.Its teaching wings benefit from cleverly designed acoustics, modern set up and technology offerings in all  classrooms, and are on two levels, with lightwells connecting them.Specially commissioned artwork is also an important feature of the new school.Local artists worked with pupils to design and create a number of pieces, including a large Oak tree in the dining area symbolizing growth with leaves painted by every child.  Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod. He argued that enforcement is the key to tackling the problem.\"If you had a traffic warden in each town again that would help,\" he added.Community councillor Colin Johnston said something should be done to address the issue of traffic and parking in the town.Struan Mackie, another Thurso and Northwest Caithness Highland councillor, stressed that it takes time to process traffic orders and pointed out that the mph plan for Wick began over two years ago.He also pointed out that the county is going to get traffic enforcement officers which should help deal with some of the parking issues.Mr MacLeod commented: \"You have got to watch you do not overdo these things.\"But Mr Potts said: \"Parking has been an issue for a long time. It is up to us to keep fighting. There is parking available in the town so the problem can be overcome.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work.

It#s anticipated this work will start on February  and could take four weeks to complete.The current one-way system means drivers can turn into Castle Street from Junction Road and on into Broad Street but vehicles do not have access from Palace Road into Broad Street.A signed ersion via Clay Loan is in place. In addition, vehicles cannot turn into Castle Street from Albert Street – but can drive on into Broad Street.The works are part of the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative’sPlaces and Spaces project, which will see improvements to the area at the bottom of the Strynd, the creation of a new path to the War Memorial at St Magnus and improvements at the head of Victoria Street.The council has said the works at the top of Castle Street will see new paving and road surfacing laid, and the road surface raised to pavement level. This initial phase of the project is due for completion early May after which works will be suspended for the main summer season.Work at the entrance to Victoria Street is set to begin in the autumn, with a suspension planned, in December for Christmas shopping season.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority. When the planning application is submitted, an opportunity will be given for representations to be made to the Planning Authority.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Highland Council has not asked the Scottish Government for support in relation to St Clementrsquos.Christyna Ferguson, whose daughter suffering a series of complex health issues including autism attends the school, slammed the councilrsquos inaction \"utter contempt for the already disadvantaged, vulnerable children\".She said: \"The Highland Council repeatedly told us that St.Clementrsquos appalling lack of facilities was due to a lack of Scottish government funding. Therefore it is misleading at best and shows not only non-compliance with their statuary obligations but utter contempt for the children.\"In the last year the Highland Council has taken no action to survey sites, secure funding or build a business plan despite assuring us they would.\"She insisted: ldquoHighland Council does have options in terms of funding solutions but they repeatedly refuse to engage in the process ndash again failing in their statutory obligations and causing unnecessary suffering and detriment to disabled children. It is incomprehensible to me that those with the power and the obligation in law can show such blatant disregard for disabled children.\"Dingwall-based MSP Kate Forbes said: \"As the daughter of a former teacher at St Clementrsquos, I am in no doubt as to the poor condition of the buildings. It is remarkable the teachers are able to care for and teach the pupils in such a damp, cramped building.ldquoThere is a desperate need for a new building, delivered in consultation with parents and teachers. This is, of course, a matter for Highland Council who are statutorily responsible for school buildings but I think everybody wants to see a solution.\"I am more than happy to work with anybody and everybody to find a solution and would sincerely hope that wersquore not still talking about school buildings in another  years.\"Childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd, also a Ross-shire-based SNP MSP, said: \"The school has not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans despite being in a poor condition.\"Itrsquos nearly a year since I first raised concerns with the council so I look forward to meeting with councillors and officers at the end of this month to hear an update on progress. All children, especially those who are disadvantaged and vulnerable, deserve our help to enable them to, not only fulfil, but to exceed their potential. That is why it is vital that we can find the right solution for the pupils, parents and the wider St Clementrsquos community.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"At this point in time we are addressing our capital plan for next year and the process is still ongoing.

And last year, another junior minister in the department, Alok Sharma said there were “very many reasons” why food banks in areas where the benefit had been rolled were up to four times busier than average.SNP MSP George Adam said Ms Rudd’s admission was “long overdue”.“The Tories ‘flagship’ welfare policy simply isn’t working, and it’s now abundantly clear that the welfare cuts inflicted by the Tories on people across Scotland are directly forcing vulnerable people into poverty,” Mr Adam said.\u2028Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine said: “In st century Britain no-one should be dependent on charitable handouts for their survival, yet that is precisely the situation that government policy has created.”Asked later whether Theresa May agreed with the Ms Rudd’s assessment of the impact of universal credit on food bank use, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman told a Westminster media briefing: “We have long acknowledged that there were issues with the initial rollout of universal credit. That’s why we have listened and made improvements, such as extending advances, removing waiting days and introducing housing benefit run-on.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"girls only digital clubs rolled out to get more young girls into science","story":"A youth charity is rolling out digital clubs for girls in a bid to get more young girls and young women into science, technology, engineering and mathematicssubjects.

I believe it is essential that in navigating our way beyond the outcomes, we must plot a course to bring some stability.In those referendums, I campaigned for Scotland to remain in the UK and for the UK to remain in the EU. But I did not campaign for the status quo. I do think the relationship between the nations of the UK is imbalanced and I do want to see the end of Tory rule from Westminster.It will come as no surprise that I believe to my core that the best way to get rid of the Tories is to elect a Labour Government with Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister, investing in our communities and our industries again. Despite its obvious challenges, we do have an opportunity after Brexit to build that progressive society. Austerity is not inevitable, the status quo is not inevitable, we write the future ourselves.The other consequence of Brexit is that it requires us to re-examine where power lies within the UK, and rebalance it so that Scotland becomes more of an equal partner. And we need to be able to discuss and debate these issues in an intelligent and informed way. One of the more frustrating aspects of the debates around independence and Brexit is how narrow they are ideas for more radical models of how our society could be organised are pushed to the side.As so often in politics, it is those who hold the most extreme views, and shout the loudest, who dominate the political and media landscape. There are some for whom the answer to every question is independence, just as there were those whose answer to everything was to leave the European Union. The dominance of these voices has made it harder to make actual, serious progress.But at the heart of each lies a desire to take back control, and that is an impulse I understand. As a democratic socialist, I more than appreciate the drive and necessity to challenge power and authority. But I do not want the Labour Party to take power for its own sake, I want to take power so that we can give it away – to people in our communities. Because after a decade of austerity, our communities do not just need investment, they need more control and they need greater stability.: Brian Monteith: Brexit plan or no Brexit plan, the EU has always been a bullyWhether you voted Yes or No to independence, or Leave or Remain in the EU referendum, it is the right thing to do to ask how we can keep these sides together. It suits some to foster ision, and therefore they find it easy to say we should abandon one side or the other. But that is not Labour’s way of doing things, and it is not my approach either. We are talking about neighbours, friends, family members. We have to find ways to unite our communities, not more ways of iding them.After all, the real ision in our society is not between Scotland and England, it is between those who own the wealth and those who through their hard work create the wealth. That is the real ision. Children living in poverty in Dundee are held back in exactly the same way as children living in poverty in Derby.So we have to redistribute wealth, and power too. There is still a restlessness in Scotland about our place in the UK. The people of Scotland said no to independence in . But, as we discuss the future, that does not mean the only choices open to us are independence or carry on as we are.After Brexit, powers that were previously held in Europe are going toto the UK. Powers over the environment, over agriculture, state aid, fishing, public procurement. We need to ensure that when those powers come back from Brussels, that they do not go to London, they come here.: Ian Blackford calls on Scottish Labour MPs to reject May’s Brexit dealWe have had devolution since . There are many in the Tory Government, and in the senior ranks of the civil service too, who seem to have forgotten that. I wrote in this newspaper in January about how we in Scotland need to recapture that spirit of ambition and hope that marked the establishment of the Scottish Parliament  years ago. There are powers we have now that we do not fully utilise.The restlessness that many people feel here in Scotland exists in parts of England too. There is a genuine sense of grievance that London – perhaps more specically, the financial City of London – wields too much power and influence, at the expense of other towns and cities.As we negotiate our path beyond Brexit, we need answers to these questions that do not keep taking us back to the same old arguments and the same old isions.I believe that people are looking for real change and real democracy. That means real change in the balance of power where they work and where they live, and not simply the transfer of power from one Parliament, and one set of politicians, to another. Brexit calls for us to look afresh at the constitutional nature of the UK. A more federal Britain, locking in and strengthening devolution, and redistributing power so that it is not concentrated but dispersed, and so shared and utilised by the people for the people.To do this, we will be required to think beyond the comfort of traditional thought and speak beyond the refuge of soundbites – not always easy for politicians to do, especially in the age of -hour news. But we have to ask and answer the questions about how our society is run and why, about how our political and economic system is run and in whose interests, about how we protect our environment and how we treat each other as human beings. These are big questions and big challenges, but they are the very fundamental questions and challenges that the Labour Party was established to meet.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"as economy falters theresa may faces mps to ask them not to delay brexit","story":"Theresa May will go before MPs today to face down calls for a delay to Brexit, amid growing unease at the impact on the economy from continued uncertainty.The Prime Minister will urge MPs to ‘hold our nerve’ before the Commons is presented with another “neutral motion” on Brexit later this week, rather than a substantive vote to approve the Brexit deal.It comes as the latest set of economic figures for the UK showed the slowest growth since , when the country was in recession.The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product growth fell to . per cent between October and December , driven by a . per cent drop in manufacturing output.In her statement to parliament, Mrs May is expected to say: “The talks are at a crucial stage.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said she would address MPs a day earlier than expected to give MPs more time to “digest the content” ahead of a series of votes scheduled for Thursday, allowing parliamentarians another chance to alter the course of Brexit or seek a delay.Following an exchange of letters between Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn, opening the door to further talks on a possible Brexit compromise, Downing Street said the government was not considering full membership of the EU customs union as demanded by the Labour leader.The demand is likely to be pushed to a vote on Thursday. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer denied reports that Mr Corbyn’s office removed a reference in the letter to a second EU referendum without his knowledge.“The letter was an agreed letter that was sent out,” Sir Keir said.“The critical question is: is she, in her response, indicating a willingness to drop her red lines or not  And that’s what needs to be tested sooner rather than later.”Mrs May also came under fresh pressure from her own side not to compromise, with International Trade Secretary Liam Fox saying Labour’s proposals were “not workable”, while Boris Johnson claimed they would produce a “toxic” Brexit.Mr Johnson suggested he could back the Brexit dealit included a time limit and unilateral exit mechanism from the Irish border backstop, but the former foreign secretary warned putting the changes in a codicil to the withdrawal agreement would not be good enough.Meanwhile, a group of anti-Brexit Conservative MPs and peers have written to the Prime Minister asking for a meeting to discuss the UK’s exit being delayed.In their letter to Mrs May, the group describing themselves as “patriotic, pragmatic Conservatives” said it the UK is “not ready to leave” on the scheduled date of  March.The Right to Vote group includes former attorney general Dominic Grieve and ex-ministers Phillip Lee, Sam Gyimah and Guto Bebb who quit the government to fight for a second referendum.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scots 2bn investment bank urged to boycott oil and gas industry","story":"Environmentalists have #hijacked# a formal consultation into Scotland#s new # billion national investment bank to call for a boycott of firms involved with the flagship oil and gas industry.A total of  per cent of the , responses took the form of an “identical” standard format submission provided by the pressure group Friends of the Earth calling for the bank’s activities to “rule out lending to fossil fuel projects”.That would mean firms connected with the North Sea industry or Grangemouth owner Ineos – which has previously received millions of pounds in public funding – would not be eligible for public cashInstead the cash should instead go to firms which help boost “offshore wind, public transport, solar and renewable heat” in the sht towards a green economy.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WINTER-19-ROADS-1.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

And back in the hungry s when every day was a grind to put the most basic grub on the table and keep a roof over your head, it was women like the lady opposite who you relied on to get you to your work on time.Our pictures show one of the last of the ‘knocker-uppers’ who rose well before the crack of dawn every day in le to go round the doors to give people their morning alarm call.Known as ‘The Lady With The Map’, Mary Millar plied her trade in Kells and Connor.A knocker-up was a job in Britain and Ireland that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution, when alarm clocks were neither cheap nor reliable.Most had given up the role by the begnning of the s but Mary was still performing her morning task up until the outbreak of World War .  The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

In  an offer was put in to purchase the former pub, and in September last year they finally moved in to the charity’s new home and began renovations to turn the building into a community facility.

Redmondshows Halax representatives Alan McLachlan and Gillian Boyd around the charitys new social enterprise shop, Wings n Things.“Mrs McFadden would have done a lot of work for charity within our town and in the local community so we really have brought that sense of community back in here,” Ms Redmond explained.Over the past six months charity staff and volunteers have been busy turning the run down pub building into a vibrant community hub which now houses a food parcel distribution project, a catering and education programme for vulnerable adults and those with learning dficulties and a senior citizens’ lunch club. Via Wings at Wellington House also provides space for after schools and parent and toddler groups, a monthly supper club and games nights, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities for many isolated and vulnerable members of the local community.Yesterday the charity held a special event to mark the opening of its new shop Wings ‘n’ Things, which will sell shabby chic and new craft items made by local crafters.Among the guests at the celebration were representatives from the Halax Foundation, which has provided funding for Via Wings to help it expand its Dare  Care project, which distributes food parcels to people in need.Thanking the Halax Foundation for providing £, towards the salary of a project manager, Ms Redmond said: “Their funding has enabled us to run the project much more efficiently because it has grown from a cupboard-sized project into a three-centred project.“We now provide food parcels to around  families every month, which averages out at about  people.To move or not to move  That is the Brexit question Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“As the number of people using our foodstore increases month-on-month the manager’s role is essential and the funding from the Halax Foundation ensures that we can continue to expand and develop the foodstore.”Gillian Boyd, trustee of the Halax Foundation NI, commented: “The Halax Foundation for Northern Ireland is delighted to support the important work of Via Wings. This particular award will enable the organisation to help those who are most vulnerable in their local community. We wish them every success in the future.”So far half of the old pub building has been renovated and Via Wings at Wellington House now boasts new offices, counselling rooms and a conference room. But that’s not the end of the redevelopment work.The charity is in the process of constructing a new coffee shop with a sensory garden and play area, which should be open within the next few months. And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health. We want to provide things like reflexology, aromatherapy, breathing techniques, helping people learn about self care.”Praising the charity’s staff and volunteers for their dedication and hard work, she added: “Without them we couldn’t run this project. We have a team here that have a passion to serve this community, to walk in unity with them and see change happen.”• About the charity and its work...Founded in  by Gail Redmond, Via Wings was set up to help people in need in Dromore and surrounding areas.The faith-based charity’s aim “is to show God’s love in a loving, caring, practical, non-judgemental way.”It runs a range of projects designed to tackle problems such as poverty, loneliness, isolation, deprivation and more.

It would take a great team to beat his Naomh Éanna side in Championship football this season. On Saturday night, they went toe-to-toe with a fine Kilcummin outfit and came off second best as the Kerry men ran out emphatic -point victors.Central to Kilcummin’s success was the scintillating performance of Kevin McCarthy # who scored a remarkable -, all from play.As his team made their way off the pitch to a remarkable ovation from their large travelling support, the Naomh Éanna boss praised their efforts after a long season which still yielded two Championship titles.“We said coming down here we could live with playing our best and getting beat by a better team. I don’t think we played our best, but we were beaten by a better team,” said Fitzsimons.“Their goalkeeperpulled off two or three great saves and you need to be getting those scores at this level.“They are a super team. I said to the boys at half-time that we were still on the bus. This is a very young side # Eoin Nagle is only  and he was as good as anyone.“There is a bright future in front of those boysthey all stick together and continue to work the way they have been.”In truth, the North Belfast men never really recovered from a nightmare start which saw them concede - inside the first eight minutes with Matt Keane and McCarthy finding the target.A stunning goal from Eoin Nagle kick-started Naomh Éanna’s challenge following a couple of good points from Odhran Eastwood and a Ruairi Scott major on  minutes left just two points between the sides.However, their good work was swtly undone at the other end in a counter attack which halted their progress.Goalkeeper Paddy Flood fouled Noel Duggan as the corner-forward was bearing down on goal following a great pass inside from Seán O’Leary. Referee James Molloy awarded the penalty and issued a black card to Flood for the take-down.To add insult to injury, defender Conor McAuley picked up an ankle ligament injury in the goalmouth scramble which ended his evening.With substitute ’keeper Conor Devlin unavailable due to his soccer commitments with Larne, Michael Morgan donned the number one jersey for the remainder of the contest, but, following a y stoppage, he couldn’t prevent Kieran Murphy from scoring the penalty.With Kilcummin moving into a - to - lead at the break, the Antrim and Ulster champions needed a fast start to the second half, yet an unanswered salvo of - put the game firmly beyond Naomh Éanna. Former Kerry goalkeeper Brendan Kealy pulled off a smart save to deny Kristian Healy early in the half, but current Kingdom ist McCarthy stole the show with some majestic scores.He dovetailed well with the industrious Noel Duggan while Murphy and centre-back Chris O’Leary pushed forward with abandon. As Naomh Éanna continued to chase the game, their defence was exposed.When Healy tested Kealy’s reflexes once again midway through the half, Kilcummin went straight down to the Davin Stand side and with McCarthy splitting the posts in ruthless fashion.With less than  minutes remaining, Kilcummin bagged their fourth major with McCarthy applying the finish following a wonderful move involving Shane McSweeey and Gary O’Leary with McCarthy turning past the advancing Morgan in the Naomh Éanna goal before driving the ball into the net.In injury-time, he completed his hat-trick with his easiest finish of the night after being left unmarked in front of goal to round off a brilliant inidual display.It wasn’t to be for Naomh Éanna, but they’ll quickly turn their attentions to the new season and tonight’s Antrim Championship draws when they will learn who there opponents will be when they make their Senior Football Championship debut later this year.

People still talk about him, and I don’t think there is that much rose-tinted glasses, as there can be when people aren’t about any more, but he was a very successful forward and good goal-scorer, and I remember kicking a ball with him in the back garden and going to games with him.“I remember the house being very busy with phonecalls and taking messages. I also remember going on holidays – we used to go camping every summer – so I have all of those good memories.”He continued: “He was a messer. He would have wound me up, he would have wound my brother and my sister up, and he would have been good fun about the house.“The older I get the more I appreciate it more from doing this type of job – although he would have been doing it in a dferent context than me – but I imagine that it would have brought a lot stress and challenges and I suppose going back to the house and winding the kids up and having a bit of craic was a way to unwind.”John was present with the rest of his family when loyalist gunmen broke into their Fortwilliam Drive home and murdered his father as they sat down to Sunday dinner. The “brutal” murder is still “very clear” to him as it changed his family’s lives forever. The proceeding years would be marked by the campaign for justice as they took on the British state.“I don’t even think I appreciate how taxing the campaign has been,” John admits.“My le growing up has been in the context of making allegations of collusion against the state in a time, from the early s onwards where the word collusion was a dirty word you were a republican propagandist. That was my normality.“It has taken me until my later years to appreciate that my mother was raising three kids, she was going to work and getting children up to get them ready for school, getting breakfast lunch and dinner ready – doing all of that having lost her husband. It has taken me a few years to realise the impact that it had on her, and that makes me appreciate and admire her a lot more than I already did.”Pat Finucane’s case is still under review by The Supreme Court as his family continue to fight for an inquiry. Asked about the signicance of the campaign for other victims of state violence, John said: “Something we have said from the very beginning of our campaign is that this apparatus and this policy that the British state had, which resulted in the deaths and the murders of so many people here, wasn’t just about Pat Finucane. They didn’t set this up just to kill my dad they killed people before him and they killed people after him.“I think it has been an example of what you can achieveyou are persistent and you have that support around you. We weren’t just a family, we had the support of NGOs, we had the support of investigative journalists, we had the support of governments and politicians. Whilst it hasn’t delivered in an inquiry, it has resulted in the word collusion having a very dferent context – people now accept that it happened and there is no longer a ‘few rotten apples in the barrel theory’ and it is no longer ‘republican propaganda’.”He continued: “The support that people have given us over the years, it’s very hard to put that into words. Whether it’s people talking about their memories of my father, people having encouraging words about our campaign, or attending events like this one in St Mary’s, it really provides us so much support.“It’s very humbling and we have always been grateful and we will remain truly grateful for that. My father came from a community that had very little and he wanted to use his education to make people’s lives much better, so for people to come out to remember and pay tribute to him means an awful lot to me and my family.”Sunday’s event will be held at pm in St Mary’s University College, Falls Road."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37805127.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/ballycastle-cliffs_002.jpg","title":"pictured madness as youths scale northern ireland cliffs without safety gear","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The surfaces are in poor condition and very dficult.\"I would call for those doing this to stop.\"Ryan Gray Senior Maritime Operations Officer for HM Coastguard added: \"The recent photos taken at Ballycastle are concerning, we want people to enjoy themselves at the coast by making sure their visit is one to remember and not one they’d rather forget.\"We strongly recommend you do not attempt to climb up or down clfs unless you are properly equipped and trained to do so, and don’t attempt to climb clfs as a short cut. If unequipped for a climb it only takes one slip or a loose rock for it to end in tragedy.

At this stage of the exercise, the Article  window is almost being closed now so we need a backstop.“The letter was an agreed letter that was sent out. The critical question is, is she, in her response, indicating a willingness to drop her red lines or not and that’s what needs to be tested sooner rather than later.“The critical thing is which direction is the Prime Minister heading in. Is she firstly trying to get her own team back on board to put her deal yet again with some supposed changes, and that’s what looks like she is doing, or is she genuinely looking to see a majority for Labour’s proposal of a customs union single market alignment.”He also expressed concerns over the backstop arrangement and in particular the customs arrangements for England, Scotland, Wales saying they “aren’t as good as they should be”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has been visiting Belfast He added: “I am concerned that with  days to go the Prime Minister is simply running down the clock, mindful that the next EU Summit is March  andshe’s is trying to run the clock down Parliament has to step in with a hard stop to say we are not going to accept that.”When asked his view on Labour Party colleagues calling for a second referendum, Sir Keir said: “I say we have got a conference motion on this, we agreed in advance what we would do and we tried to foreshadow the decisions we would have to make and we thought we would have to vote on a deal first,the deal goes down there would be a general election.“If there can’t be a general election then options including a public vote should be on the table.

That’s the critical issue here.“Our view is Theresa May should look across the benches at the Labour Party and reach the softest possible Brexit and jettison the ERGand try and make accommodation with Keir Starmer and his colleagues who it seems to me are announcing a very soft Brexit with a UK-wide customs union and a close alignment with the single market.

Arlene Foster called for \"cool heads\".Over the weekend there was anger after both Tony Blair and John Major warned leaving the EU without a deal risked damaging the peace process.Nigel Dodds said: \"Some of the language and rhetoric employed last week was not conducive to making progress and securing the agreement we all want to see.

An amendment is set to be tabled requiring the Commons to have another \"meaningful vote\" on the deal on the table by February . There is concern among parliamentarians the Prime Minister may be \"running down the clock\" in order to force her deal through.North Belfast MP Dodds said the focus had to be on tackling the backstop, saying it was the \"central problem\". \"The Prime Minister has committed to securing legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement. Those changes will be required for Parliament to support any deal. The EU cannot continue to hark back to a proposed deal which was comprehensively rejected by the House of Commons. There is no agreement without Parliament’s support.\"He added: \"Over the next number of weeks the options will become increasingly clear, particularly for the European Union. If the political will is there then an agreement can be achieved. The alternative is to cling to an unacceptable backstop which actually increases the chances of an outcome it was supposedly designed to prevent.

We’ll call it barriers, we’ll call it whatever they want,” Mr Trump said. “But now it turns out not only don’t they want to give us money for a wall, they don’t want to give us the space to detain murderers, criminals, drug dealers, human smugglers.”The recent shutdown left more than , government workers without pay, forced postponement of the State of the Union address and sent Mr Trump’s poll numbers tumbling."},{"url":null,"title":"napalm girl kim phuc receives prize for peace work","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is the case whether there is a soft or hard Brexit.“The response that is needed is one that while cognisant of our EU responsibilities, nonetheless addresses the singular problems facing Ireland – namely the threat Brexit poses to exporters, the all-island economy, the Good Friday Agreement, and the border.“We believe in a dual strategy for dealing with a no-deal Brexit.“The first is to mitigate its effects in the short-term through state measures, and second to overcome the disruption through medium to long-term investment in capital and social infrastructure.“Brexit does not just affect business – it affects communities and people as well.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Any Brexit strategy worth its salt needs to reflect and address this reality. This holds whether there is a deal or not.“Finally, the people of the north must be given a say in their own future – either it is with an isolated and inward–looking Britain or it is with a reunied Ireland. Brexit puts a border poll – a referendum on Irish unity – firmly on the agenda.“There is a need for direct government support for those importers and exporters that trade exclusively with Britain.“The vast majority of these businesses are small to medium-sized enterprisesand as such are lacking the scale of resources to easily change practices that were many years in the making – and to do so before the end of March .“Sinn Féin believes that a €bn Brexit stabilisation fund should be established, that rights of workers at risk of a Brexit ‘race to the bottom’ should be strengthened, and that the Irish government must prepare for a referendum on Irish unity following Brexit.“This should be used to invest in much-need infrastructure, in roads, ports, rails, public transport, housing, health, and education.“We need a plan that is directed at the issues facing Ireland, not just those facing the EU.\"Deputy Cullinane concluded: “This document is Sinn Féin’s contribution to this process.” Sinn Féins Brexit contingency proposals can be accessed at https:www.sinnfein.ie files  DC_Brexit_Document_Jan_.pdf"},{"url":null,"title":"crossgates nursery little acorns celebrates estyn success","story":"Little Acorns Children Nursery, Crossgates near Llandrindod Wells have had a gooltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtd Estyn Report..Pictltspan classtruncate-full-screengtured are children from Little Acorns and back left to right, Amanda Baylissand Becky Pritchard .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Little Acorns nursery #thrilled# with latest Estyn reportLittle Acorns Children Nursery, Crossgates near Llandrindod Wells have had a gooltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtd Estyn Report..Pictltspan classtruncate-full-screengtured is Becky Pritchardwith Bobby Watkins and Mylah Drew..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" Little Acorns nursery #thrilled# with latest Estyn reportLittle Acorns Children Nursery, Crossgates near Llandrindod Wells have had a gooltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtd Estyn Report.Pictultspan classtruncate-full-screengtred are children from Little Acorns and back left to right, Amanda Baylissand Becky Pritchard Picture by Phil Blagg.PB--lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"colour codes 2019 llandrindod wells cp school most improved","story":"Llandrindod Wells Cefnllys Primary School..Pictured left to right, Hayley Smith ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt Karen Jenkinsand Lorraine Cadwallader-Jones .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"COLOUR CODES: Cefnllys Primary School is the most improved in PowysLlandrindod Wells Cefnllys Primary School..Pictured left to right, Lorraine Cadwltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtallader-JonesKaren Jenkinsand Hayley Smith .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" COLOUR CODES: Cefnllys Primary School is the most improved in PowysLlandrindod Wells Cefnllys Primary School..Pictured are members of the school coltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuncil..Picture by Phltspan classtruncate-full-screengtil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" COLOUR CODES: Cefnllys Primary School is the most improved in PowysLlandrindod Wells Cefnllys Primary School..Pictured left to right, Hayley Smith ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt Karen Jenkinsand Lorraine Cadwallader-Jones .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"aurora like airglow in the sky above the elan valley near rhayader as meteor passes by","story":"A meteor enters the earth#s atmosphere over the snowy hills of the Elan Vallltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtey in Powys while etltspan classtruncate-full-screengthereal green #airglow# spreads across the sky.

Mill Field undergoes further repairs, could easily have collected three points with a resolute second half display, but Ballynagross closed up shop after taking - lead at the end of the first half.Both sides settled quickly with the excellent playing surface encouraging players to keep the ball on the floor. It was Ballynagross, who didnrsquot seem to miss the suspended Matthew Rooney and Declan Dowie too much, that drew first blood in the fth minute.The dashing Eoin Rooney, who was making his first team debut following a recent move from Downpatrick FC, took full advantage of a failed offside call from Killough, sped past Stevie Laverty and beat new lsquokeeper Peter Kelly with a clinical finish.Killough retaliated immediately with Michael Burns, Gareth George and Tony McIhone prodding patiently from the middle of the park and when an opening came, Declan Looney, a team-mate of Eoin Rooney at Downpatrick not that long ago, put the burners on and rled a sweet equaliser past Conor McCullough, a former Killough lsquokeeper, from just inside the box.As expected from a derby clash, no quarter was asked or given and it took a few yellow cards to bring the combatants under control before Daniel Taggart popped up in the box to restore the visitorsrsquo lead with a poacherrsquos finish.Killough tried to get back on level terms with Freddie OrsquoConnor raiding down the flank and Ross Armstrong working overtime in a bid to create something of note. However, a Ballynagross back four of Conor Marron, John Shields, Aaron Beattie and Gary Carberry were in dominant form and they steadfastly refused to give way.Karl Gelstonrsquos side was more than happy to hit Killough on the break and midway through the first half, assassin Donal McCavera gave them a - lead as Killough were caught chasing the game.Killough had to throw caution to the wind and pulled a goal back just before the break when the dangerous McIlhoneexploded into le when he drilled in a beauty to give his side every chance of getting a result.The second half, although as equally as combative, never reached the dizzy heights of the first  minutes with two well-matched sides cancelling each other out in a midfield war of attrition.Chances were few and far between with the respective defences on top. Killough again did the chasing, but there was just no way past Carberry and Beattie and lsquokeeper McCullough did all that was asked of him.The longer the game went on, the deeper Ballynagross defended, but in the final analysis, Killough just didnrsquot have the necessary firepower to break them down.Killough: Peter Kelly, Colm Kearney, Stevie Laverty, Jason Clarke, Kevin Groves, Tony McIlhone, Michael Burns, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Declan Looney, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George.

He has a proud direct lineage to the band when it first started out  years ago. His great-uncle, James Strain of Woodgrange, was the bandrsquos first pipe major.He also has pipes dating back to the early days of the band, a much-prized piece of heritage along with the framed photographs of former pipe band members and lodge members which line the walls of the Orange Hall.James Strain was taught by the bandrsquos first piping instructor, William Maxwell from Newcastle, who used to travel by train to Tullymurry on the Ballydugan Road and then arrive by bicycle or horse and cart to the hall.Sammy, who joined the band when he was seven, says, as do other members, that his introduction into the pipe band world was a natural extension of his family le.ldquoIt was actually my cousin who taught me the pipes even though my father Sam was pipe major at the time, he said.ldquoI joined in  and played my first Twelfth in Newcastle in  when I was nine. At that time I was playing whatrsquos called a three-quarter set of pipes.ldquoI canrsquot remember being askedI wanted to join but as my great-grandfather was one of the first members, it was just in the family. It was just handed down, it was taken for granted, more or less, that you were going to learn the pipes.ldquoWhen we started out, there really was nothing  so the band was number one. Itrsquos dficult now to keep a band going with so many other things for the young ones to be doing, so how we managed to keep a band going  years, I do not know.From head to toe, it can cost from between pound to pound, to kit out an adult pipe band member in full unorm and around pound for child members.The unorm has always represented a major investment mdash in addition to practice and competition timemdash for any member.In his history of the band on its th anniversary, Sammy recounted the lower end of a quotation given for a new unorm in  coming in at  pounds  shillings, which is equivalent to around pound today.The retired farmer has been with the band during the worst and the best of times.ldquoWe went through a lean period in the late Eighties and we werenrsquot contesting then. We started contesting in  and then again about five or six years ago, he said.ldquoThe best time of the band I can recall was in  when I retired as pipe major. My cousin, Francey Strain, took the band over and as we had a lot of young ones then, those were the best years up until  where we went to the World Pipe Band Championships in Cowal and we were upgraded three times in that time.The best of times for Hollymount was when they came runners-up in their grade B at the World Championships on their first entry into the competition.Ronnie Steele recalls: ldquoWe were very nearly not going but decided at the last minute so it was a real rush to try and book the boat and to find somewhere for us all to stay.Hollymount achieved their biggest achievement to date on one of the blackest days in Northern Ireland history mdash the day of the Omagh bombing on August ,.While the band continued throughout the  years of the Troubles, it emerged unscathed, according to Ronnie, who adds: ldquoThrough all the Troubles we had never any bother down here we never missed anything out.Another strong family connection belongs to pipe major Sam Gill ndash whose maternal uncle is Sammy Strain. His two sons, Jackand seven year-old Charlie, are in the band. When the  year-old isnrsquot at the band or at work as a mechanic, he continues to perfect his skill as a former world ploughing champion and the winner of the NI title for  years.ldquoMy father, Raymond, played in the band as did my twin brother, David, who now plays for Drumlough Pipe Band.ldquoWhen I joined at the age of eight, it was just a matter in those days that after my father came home from work and got a bit of dinner, he would have say, rsquoRight, I take you up to the bandrsquo.ldquoSammy Strain taught me the notes on a blackboard whereas now you have the likes of Ronniersquos daughter, Christie, who records me on her phone playing and she practice.Ronnie shares his love of the band with daughters Christie , Ashleyand three year-old Megan. No doubt his youngest, one year-old Alexandra, will be drafted in a few years time.Piper Ryan Green, who used to play for the former Seaforde and Woodgrange Pipe Bands, has also introduced his  year-old son, Matthew, while piper Robert Neill plays alongside his  year-old daughter Laura.Sometimes the pull towards piping and Hollymount misses a generation. However, the family influence remains strong as in the case of siblings Jessica and Thomas Watson, whose great grandfather, David Stranney, was in the band, although their parents werenrsquot.But the members know that keeping the band going for the next generation is an even greater challenge today than it was  years ago.They are delighted that it currently has  members aged  and under in the band.Apart from marching in the annual Twelfth celebrations, the main activity for the band is performing at local concerts where it has raised more than pound, in recent years for charities.Sam Gill says that the next big push, once some of the younger members are ready for it, will be to start competing in contests again, although they know it may take some time to reach their former B grade.ldquoTherersquos still a hunger to try and get the band to be as good as possible. The problem we have mdash and any band will tell you the same mdash is trying to keep the young ones interested becauseyou donrsquot, they will leave, he added.ldquoBands like ours are often recruitment bands for other larger ones but we would dearly love to see more experienced band members joining Hollymount and passing on their experience to the next generation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Contractors continue with leisure centre demolition  ","story":"WORK is progressing at pace to demolish the old Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick.Contractors are razing the old building to the ground as its poundm replacement continues to break membership records, with additional staff drafted in to cope with the volume of people coming through the doors.Four decades after the old centre opened, it is being reduced to a pile of rubble as the soaraway success of its ultra-modern replacement continues, with users flocking in their droves and membership doubling within a week.The old centre was the first major leisure complex built in the district and was one of the most modern of its kind when the doors opened for business, boasting a new swimming pool and a suite of other facilities, including a large sports hall.Contractors in charge of the demolition began work shortly before Christmas and over the past few weeks have made signicant progress.The old sports hall has been razed to the ground with contractors currently using heavy equipment to demolish the old swimming pools and reception area.The old centre was a major community hub and in addition to meeting the districtrsquos leisure needs, the large hall hosted many community events including public rallies, former Down Council election counts, drama productions and even concerts featuring a host of local artists.While the centre had long since passed its sell-by-date, the former Down Council was keen to replace it and the work the local authority started was completed by its successor, Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The old centre closed for the final time at the end of November,  years after it opened.

We have more quality control on our beef and that is what makes it high grade. This leaves us in a very dficult position because we cannot produce our beef for any less than we already do.ldquoOur fear is that, in the event of a lsquono dealrsquo and there isnrsquot enough UK beef to satisfy demand, they will look at bringing in beef from outside of the UK. If itrsquos brought in at a cheaper price it could very well leave us in a tight spot.Mr Rice, whose family has been in farming for generations, continued: ldquoBeef and lamb have been subsidised by the EU indirectly in the form of Single Farm Payments. Dairy, pork and chicken are already at world prices and can already compete. They will not see such a big fluctuation whereas we will be more exposed.ldquoIf Prime Minister Teresa May were to step in and take over the subsidies, the outlook looks favourable in the short term.ldquoBut when a boat load of beef comes in from Brazil then almost certainly subsidies will be reduced and wersquoll be paid to maintain the landscape. In other words wersquoll be reduced to gardeners.Describing Brexit as the ldquobiggest peacetime emergency in almost a century, Ballynahinch farmer Barry Higgins said the uncertainty of the situation did not do farmers any favours.ldquoWe feel itrsquos more of a back lash than a back stop, he remarked, adding that he hoped no farmers would be forced out of business.Dessie Canavan, from Kilcoo, said farmers were being ldquodragged into Brexit against their will.ldquoIt is unfair for us to compete against the likes of Brazil and Argentina, he remarked. ldquoDepending on the size of our farm, sometimes we are forced out into part-time jobs to subsidise our income. And thatrsquos before Brexit comes into force. There is much to be concerned about.A spokesman for Downpatrick Co Operative Marketing Ltd said its role was to respect the views of all its shareholders and customers, who are farmers.He added: ldquoOur business relies solely on the trading of livestock both locally and outside Northern Ireland and we are therefore concerned about the impact Brexit will have on our daily business and the local faming community we serve.ldquoAs part of a democratic society we respect the peoplersquos vote to leave the EU, but we are also aware the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.ldquoWe now have a situation with two main options mdash either crash out or negotiate a deal to leave. Our main fear with the crash out option is that it exposes us all to a greater risk of casualties rather than survivors.ldquoOver the past  months Teresa May has been trying tirelessly to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that represents and respects all the people within the UK.The spokesman said: ldquoAll we ask is the same respect is given to any deal which identies and supports the uniqueness of trading and faming in Northern Ireland. Businesses and farmers are very good at adapting to change in whatever form it comes but at present, with no clear decision on Brexit, the ongoing development of any business has been affected.The Ulster Farmersrsquo Union is also concerned at the prospect of a lsquono dealrsquo Brexit UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: ldquoWe respect the referendum result and that the UK will leave the EU. However, the uncertainty is very damaging.ldquoWith March  less than  days away decisions need to be taken urgently and a deal agreed. Leaving the EU without a deal would be catastrophic for Northern Irelandrsquos farming families and their businesses.ldquoNo deal means high tarfs on our exports creating an effective trade embargo and the possibility of lower standard imports flooding the UK market.ldquoThese practical issues will have an immediate and profound impact on farmers, causing major disruptions to the supply chain, crippling the industry and rendering our farmers uncompetitive..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 6%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch headmaster hit out at the education authorities this week for the lack of permanent accommodation at his school where two thirds of the pupils are in wooden huts.Mr Harry Bent said St Colmanrsquos High School had been promised a major extension, but was unlikely to get it ldquoas long as comprehensive education is the policy of the Government.Speaking at the schoolrsquos annual prize day, Mr Bent said it angered him that the provision of accommodation had not kept pace with the growing numbers and successes of pupils.ldquoIn St Colmanrsquos nine temporary classrooms accommodate  pupils out of a total of , he said. ldquoThis means that almost two thirds of our pupils are in temporary accommodation which was first erected as a temporary measure ten years ago.Mr Bent stressed temporary classrooms may solve a financial problem for the Government, but there was so substitute for normal school accommodation.ldquoAt least  of the  subjects on the secondary curriculum are practical subjects, such as domestic science.

The cells have become the kitchen and the remaining rooms have been completely renovated.Because of its similarity with other police stations the current owners have had several amusing incidents when people have called looking for directions, or asking for stray drunks to be locked up for the night.A spokesman for the estate agents agreed that it was one of the most unusual buildings to appear on the property market and added that it would suit anyone worried about security problems!NEWCASTLE mdash Provisional plans for Newcastlersquos summer fun programme mdash the centrepiece of Down Districtrsquos holiday entertainment mdash are already being drawn up.Newcastle Town Committee mdash the local body which co-ordinates the summer programme mdash held its annual convention last week and preparations for this yearrsquos programme got underway.Members of the town committee have pledged their determination to make this yearrsquos event even bigger and better than before. Although plans are still at a very early stage the town committee is hoping to add a iety of new events to the programme, including a motorcycle event to the top of Slieve Donard.Mr John Toner, chairman of the town committee, said the theme of the  summer programme will be directly related to the worldwide lsquoYear of the Childrsquo campaign and that it would be important to get a maximum number of young people involved, particularly local youth organisations.DRUMANESS mdash The Drumaness branch of the SDLP melds its annual meeting recently with Down councillor Mr John Ritchie presiding.Mr Ritchie congratulated the branch on a very successful year which had proved dficult politically, although the party had come through well.He said they looked forward to the European elections in June and that in John Hume the party had the best candidate in the field and that a great effort would be needed to ensure success.Turning to the Westminster election, which most people expect in early June, Mr Ritchie said that in Eddie McGrady the party had an excellent candidate with a record of service second to none.Officers elected at the meeting were Anne Thompson, chairperson Patrick Toman, vice-chairman Anne Magee, secretary and Denis Fagan, treasurer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The pantomime Aladdin is to be presented by the Killyleagh Players this Friday and Saturday in Killyleagh High School. The panto faithfully follows the fairytale of Aladdin, the magic lamp and the evil uncle with a Chinese setting in three acts.The taxing role of Aladdin is played by Heather McMurray, with Jim Woods filling the other lead part as the hilarious Widow Twankey.

Sligo went into added time at the end of the game with a one point lead, but Caolan Mooney popped up from nowhere in the th minute to fire the ball to the net after a piercing move involving Darren OrsquoHagan, Johnny Flynn, Kevin McKernan and Donal OrsquoHare.To say that Tally was pleased to hear the final whistle would be an understatement.ldquoWe probably did steal it, he admitted. ldquoIrsquod say Sligo are bitterly disappointed with that.ldquoThey were one point up going into injury time and Irsquom sure they thought they were going to win it.ldquoWe were able to get ourselves level and get a point ahead, but we werenrsquot able to hold on to it.But a goal at that stage is very hard to come back from, so Irsquoll take it.Mooney was the real star of the show and in addition to scoring the winning goal, he also found time to fire over two superb points.His direct running sets him apart and he has the necessary power and pace to attack when defences least expect it.He also has bags of experience and Tally believes that helped get Down over the line.ldquoA wee bit of experience helped us, the manager said. ldquoDarren OrsquoHagan came in, Kevin McKernan and Caolan Mooney got more football and Ryan Johnston as well. Those players made a signicant dference, he said afterwards.ldquoWe knew we had to get something from the game, Tally continued. ldquoWe lost last week and we were disappointed with our performance. Wersquove still a lot of work to do. We made a lot of mistakes and conceded a lot of turnovers.ldquoThere are boys still finding their feet at this level, which is part of it.

The only exception would be when sensitive information is being discussed, he said. ldquoNo reasoning was given as to why the CIL visit should have been in private.Councillor Dermot Curran said the event should have been held in the ldquofull glare of the public and asked why more meetings were now being arranged mdash at the ratepayersrsquo expense mdash when one open to all councillors, the press and the public would have been sufficient.Slieve Croob councillor John Rice also expressed concern that only elected representatives were able to hear from the Commissioners.ldquoThis meeting was about a lighthouse and it was ridiculous that the public, in particular those campaigning to retain the beam, were not permitted to listen to the debate, he added.Cllr Cadogan Enright, whose proposal that reporters and the public should have been admitted was defeated, believes there was no reason to exclude them. He claimed the attitude of ldquohiding what was going on in council was becoming too common and needed to be stopped.ldquoTransparency in council is the best way to win public trust, he declared. ldquoThe Commissioners said they are not proposing to take away the existing apparatus except for the mercury bath. They propose putting a new rotating LED beam on the top of the lighthouse to demonstrate that they were listening to local people and plan to bring this all to consultation later in the year.Cllr Enright said the Commissioners confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Council could bring forward a partnership with a local preservation group in a manner similar to what happened at Loop Head lighthouse in Co Clare.A council spokesman said: ldquoThis workshop was a preliminary information session for councillors and prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation is planned, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoCouncillors present also agreed to invite officers from the Commissioner of Irish Lights to a joint DEA Forum meeting to ensure information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Magical Mooney conjures up late%2C late winner  ","story":"DOWN were forced to rely on an eleventh hour intervention from Caolan Mooney to get over the line at Connolly Park, Sligo, on Sunday.The Rostrevor governor swooped in added time to turn a - to - deficit into a winning scenario with a sensational last-gasp goal to give Paddy Tallyrsquos charges their first win of the campaign.It all looked so bleak for the visitors for most of the game as Sligo dominated the exchanges, but Down hung on grimly and Mooney saved the day four minutes into added time.Sligo started in a hurry and points from Pat Hughes and Liam Gaughan gave the hosts a - to - lead after five minutes.Hughes slammed in a quick goal to increase Sligorsquos lead to five points before Paul Devlin registered Downrsquos first score with a converted free in the eighth minute.Further unanswered points from Pat Havern and Ryan and Jerome Johnston brought Down to within a point of the home side midway through the first half.

He said the review will not be completed until December.Cllr Curran said Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie were at the heart of their respective communities and that new investment was required to allow them to develop.ldquoWhile I welcome the planned review, I am concerned at how long it will take to complete. In addition, how will any recommendations around future investment for example be implemented in the absence of a ing Stormont Assembly  he asked.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to make pound, to assist with plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour, helping secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry.The local authority is making the cash available to the recently formed Ardglass harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals to help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ardglass.The money has been earmarked to help the new group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use.Cllr Curran said many people were eager to read the conclusions of the government departmentrsquos review, particularly in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.He added: ldquoAt this point in time all those within the fishing sector in particular are looking at the ongoing discussions around Brexit and wondering what any final decision will have on an already heavily regulated industry.Meanwhile, Ardglass Golf Club is the venue for a special event next Wednesday, February , when funding opportunities under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund support programme will be outlined during an information session which runs between am and .pm.The funding initiative is designed to support a broad range of projects that focus on promoting economic growth through job creation and social inclusion in coastal and inland communities which depend on fishing and aquaculture.This includes the ersication of activities within fisheries and into other sectors of the maritime economy with the pound.m funding cake being administered by the South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which comprises representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors within the Newry, Mourne and Down and Ards and North Down council areas.The projects eligible for financial support must must demonstrate how they will impact on fishing dependent communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s James and Kirsty dance to success  ","story":"YOUNG farmers from all over Co Down descended upon a Belfast hotel recently for this yearrsquos star-studded grand final of Strictly Young Farmers.More usually associated with Simmentals and Shorthorns the Strictly contestants showed they were equally at home with a good salsa or a samba on stage at the Crown Plaza Hotel in a bid to win the much revered glitter ball.The event sponsored by Barclays, saw Young Farmersrsquo clubs from all over Co Down welcome a crowd of over , made up of sponsors, family and friends, to support this yearrsquos dancers.The enthusiastic audience were dazzled with a vast array of steps and styles including the cha cha cha, jive, charleston, paso doble and American smooth.In preparation for the big night the committed couples underwent a strict regime every Monday evening since last November.Following much swinging, sweat and a lot of fake tan the couples were well able to showcase their talent at the annual event to raise funds for Alzheimerrsquos Society and local Young Farmersrsquo clubs.The event was hosted by past YFCU president Roberta Simmons, of Rathfriland YFC, past YFCU vice-president Harry Crosby, of Spa YFC, and current YFCU vice-president Andrew Patton, from Newtownards YFC.Assisting with the eveningrsquos entertainment were judges Karen Patterson from the BBC and past Young Farmer, James Trotman, Agri Manager for Barclays, Janet Plunkett, Fundraising Manager for Alzheimerrsquos Society in Northern Ireland, and Zita McNaugher, current YFCU deputy president.Competing couples George Porter and Laura Sproule, Matthew Ney and Rebecca Nelson, Chris Reid and Sarah Robinson, Harry Walker and Emma Connolly, James Gilpin and Emma McAnea, Ward Patterson and Sarah Reid, Richard Kennedy and Jessica Lee, Harry Hamilton and Louise McAnea, Graham Annett and Sarah Graham wowed the crowd with their twinkle toes.However, it was James McCauley and Kirsty Burrows, from Spa YFC, who danced their way to the top with their energetic charleston to be crowned Strictly winners .The organising committee, led by Co Down YFC chairperson Linzi Stewart and secretary Kristina McKeag, thanked everyone who helped make the night such a success, particularly sponsors, hosts, judges, family and friends and last but not least the dancers, who were the stars of the show..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17416592.marie-jones-returns-to-the-ardhowen-a-place-of-happy-memories/resources/images/9400255.jpg","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

Thus, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland becomes a land border between the UK and the EU.Letter to the editorIronically, between % and % of the Republic of Ireland’s goods travel to Great Britain, either for consumption there or moving on to other EU or world destinations. Therefore, the land border only deals with comparatively small volumes of goods. It might be useful to put this in perspective as compared to total EU goods flows.The EU statistical agency, Eurostat, stated in January  that the total value of Intra-EU trade in goods in  was €, billion. On th December , the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency stated that in  the value of goods exported to the Republic from Northern Ireland was €. billion. Consequently, Northern Ireland’s exports to the Republic represented .% of EU trade in goods in . This was equivalent to .% of the Republic’s total imports from the world in  Of course I fully understand and appreciate that €. billion is a huge deal in terms of Northern Ireland’s economy but the fact remains that when local cross border trade is assessed against the total volume of EU trade, it seems utterly bizarre that such a relatively modest amount should be threatening to derail negotiations affecting €, billion — a thousand times as much — right across the continent, from Lisbon to Latvia. Of course there will be goods in transit and there is potential for some unscrupulous traders to try and subvert the single market, but there are ways of dealing with that. For example, the UK could create an offence for anyone to export goods to the EU which are not compliant with EU standards.Geography is also a protection as it is expensive and obvious to be moving goods around these islands especiallyferry crossings are involved. I believe the Withdrawal Agreement is a sledgehammer to crack a relatively small — although crucial and politically sensitive — nut and serious discussions need to be taking place to negotiate an alternative. It’s all politics now and the exchanges and comments of Donald Tusk and Leo Varadkar have poisoned the atmosphere further. If they have nothing constructive to say they would be better to stay silent.Two pupils deserve credit for even trying Chinese, let alone doing well in it Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Lord Empey, House of LordsJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      Lord Empey: Withdrawal Agreement backstop is a sledgehammer to crack a relatively small nutIf you leave a customs union, naturally you cannot expect to have the same rights and privileges as an existing member.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos vital that people of all ages have access to impartial news which is relevant to them, and we provide younger audiences with a wide range of stories.ldquoWersquore happy to look at what more we can do to share our technical and digital expertise for the benefit of local publishers, but as the review itself says, any curtailing of the BBCrsquos news offer would be counter-productive.Responding to the review, James Mitchinson, editor of the Yorkshire Post, said he did not want ldquotaxpayer subsidies or ldquogovernment handouts.He said: ldquoWe need a level playing field and a fair deal: we need swt action, for sure.ldquoBig digital s that happily display our content without paying for it hellip must now honour a royalty mechanism so that we can continue to do what we do for the betterment of the communities we serve.Henry Faure Walker, chief executive of regional publisher Newsquest Media Group, said: ldquoAs Dame Cairncross says, there is no other area of journalism so important for the health of local democracy than local news, and finding a way to support local news is now a matter of urgency.ldquoThe focus now moves on to Government who we hope will be bold and ambitious. We look forward to working with them on meaningful and high-impact solutions that will support the incredibly important role that local publishers and their public interest journalism fulfils in communities across theand breadth of the UK.Labour deputy leader and shadow culture secretary Tom Watson also said that criticism of the BBC was misplaced.ldquoDame Frances has adopted a number of Labourrsquos policies, such as tax reliefs for public service journalism, but attacking the BBC is barking up the wrong tree, he said.ldquoWhile she has recommended an inquiry into BBC News Online, the real fundamental problem that the government must now deal with is the duopoly in the digital advertising market, with over half of all revenues going to Facebook and Google.ldquoAs long as tech giants continue to completely dominate the market itrsquos dficult to see how a sustainable financial footing for journalism can be achieved.Google spokesman Richard Gingras said: ldquoWe are committed to supporting vibrant and sustainable quality journalism, directing our users to news websites more than  billion times a month and sharing more than % of any revenue generated from our ad technology with news publishers.ldquoWe have worked closely with the Cairncross inquiry and look forward to discussing the proposals further to ensure sustainable, high quality journalism in the UK.Damian Collins, chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, welcomed the reviewrsquos findings, particularly on social media companies.ldquoIn particular I agree with her that there needs to be a broad-based code of conduct to rebalance the relationship between news providers and social media s, and that this should include an obligation on behalf of the s to help their users distinguish between quality journalism and stories coming from organisations that have been linked to disinformation or are regarded as being unreliable sources, he said.ldquoThe requirement for social media companies to introduce such measures could form part of a new system of content regulation on these s, based on a statutory code, and overseen by an independent regulator like Ofcom..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: News industry welcomes  uthoughtful u review into future sustainability article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We certainly hope so.The border debate got most of the attention, but it is just part of a major spending measure to fund a bevy of Cabinet departments.A collapse of the negotiations would have imperilled another upcoming round of budget talks that are required to prevent steep spending cuts to the Pentagon and domestic agencies.Workers prepare for President Donald Trumprsquos campaign rally at El Paso County Coliseum Mr Trump travelled to El Paso, Texas, for a campaign-style rally on Monday night focused on immigration and border issues.He has been adamant that Congress approve money for a wall along the Mexican border, though he no longer repeats his  mantra that Mexico will pay for it, and he took to the stage as politicians back in Washington were announcing their breakthrough.ldquoThey said that progress is being made with this committee, Mr Trump told his audience, referring to the congressional bargainers. ldquoJust so you know, wersquore building the wall anyway.Democrats carried more leverage into the talks after besting Mr Trump on the -day shutdown but showed flexibility in hopes on winning Mr Trumprsquos signature.After yielding on border barriers, Democrats focused on reducing funding for detention beds to curb what they see as unnecessarily harsh enforcement by Immigration and Customs Enforcement .The agreement yielded curbed funding, overall, for ICE detention beds, which Democrats promised would mean the agency would hold fewer detainees than the current average of , detainees held each day. Democrats claimed the number of beds would be ratcheted down to ,.But a proposal to cap at , the number of detainees caught in areas away from the border mdash a limit Democrats say was aimed at preventing overreach by the agency mdash ran into its own Republican wall.We are fighting for all Americans, from all backgrounds, of every age, race, religion, birthplace, color  creed.

Wersquoll call it barriers, wersquoll call it whatever they want, Mr Trump said. ldquoBut now it turns out not only donrsquot they want to give us money for a wall, they donrsquot want to give us the space to detain murderers, criminals, drug dealers, human smugglers.The recent shutdown left more than , government workers without pay, forced postponement of the State of the Union address and sent Mr Trumprsquos poll numbers tumbling..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Congressional US politicians reach deal on border wall funding article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this House has required and deliver Brexit on time.ldquoBy getting the changes we need to the backstop by protecting and enhancing workersrsquo rights and environmental protections and by enhancing the role of Parliament in the next phase of negotiations I believe we can reach a deal that this House can support.Talks are continuing apace between the UK and EU, with Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and Mrs Mayrsquos de facto deputy, David Lidington, meeting MEPs in Strasbourg on Tuesday.Mr Barclay was said to have held ldquoconstructive talks on Monday night with the EUrsquos chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels.The pair agreed to further meetings in the coming days, while their teams will continue to work to find a way forward.Meanwhile, Sky News reported the former president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, had dinner with Mr Lidington in Brussels on Monday night.Mr Van Rompuy has been tipped as a potential ldquoinfluencer to break the Brexit deadlock, the broadcaster reported.Negotiations of a kind have also been taking place back in Westminster, with an exchange of letters between Mrs May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.The letter addressed to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn from Prime Minister Theresa May However a Cabinet minister insisted there is ldquono chance of Mrs May accepting Labourrsquos vision for leaving the EU, despite speculation she could soften her stance on customs union membership.In an exclusive interview with the Press Association, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom dismissed the prospect of Mrs May adopting Mr Corbynrsquos ldquoworld view.Mrs Leadsom, an ardent Leaver, said she would stay in the Cabinet to help Mrs May deliver Brexit and denied that the PM was softening her stance over a customs union in a letter to Mr Corbyn.Mrs Mayrsquos reply sparked concern among Conservative Brexiteers that the Prime Minister could concede too much ground to Labour in an attempt to win cross-party backing for a deal with Brussels.Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom Mrs Leadsom said: ldquoI think shersquos making quite clear that what Corbyn is demanding is actually not as good as what the Prime Ministerrsquos deal is offering.ldquoSo he wants a customs union and he is unclear as to whether that means he also wants an independent trade policy.ldquoHersquos unclear as to whether he also wants to stop free movement, and of course the EUrsquos view would be, lsquowell,yoursquore in the customs union then you have free movement and you abide by the common external tarfrsquo.ldquoI think therersquos no doubt that what the Prime Minister is offering is better than what Corbyn is demanding, which simply begs the question,they like it, why donrsquot they vote for it Mrs Leadsom said there was ldquono chance Mrs May would adopt Mr Corbynrsquos ldquoview of the world, adding: ldquoThe Prime Minister has been absolutely clear wersquore leaving the EU, wersquore leaving the customs union, wersquore leaving the single market.The frontbencher refused to say what the cut-off date would be for the necessary legislation to get through the Commons to allow the UK to leave the EU as planned on March .She said it was possible to pass bills ldquoquite quickly with ldquogoodwill from the Commons and Lords, but added: ldquoItrsquos just not possible to say how quickly it could be done..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: May to urge MPs to  uhold our nerve u over Brexit article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house_11.jpg","title":"future of house of fraser in belfast secured amid fresh lease","story":"Posted on Friday February  by John Mulgrew The future of House of Fraser in Belfast appears to be safe after the retailer signed a fresh lease on its anchor store at Victoria Square, it can be revealed.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
