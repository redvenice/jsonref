Anyone famous? Er, yeah… just a bit…Caroline met Prince Harry (who got engaged to Meghan Markle five months ago), five years her junior, in 2009 via a mutual friend called Natalie Pinkham.It was match-making of the highest quality, seeing as Caroline had just split from her boyfriend.‘So I was just sitting there and he arrived with a few others in tow and we all spent the evening chatting and laughing.’Then in the end, Caroline’s ‘friendship’ with the prince meant she was labelled his ‘bit of rough’. She explained: ‘To meet a prince is so unlikely it would be weird not to acknowledge it.‘However, once the story got out, that was it. We had to stop seeing each other. I was no longer Caroline Flack, TV presenter, I was Caroline Flack, Prince Harry’s bit of rough.’In 2011, two years after her Prince Harry fling, Caroline was introduced to young Harry Styles, a former contestant on The X Factor.The future One Direction heartthrob was just 17 while Caroline, the presenter of The Xtra Factor, was 31.She wrote: ‘I already knew that he had a crush on me, he’d made it pretty obvious. He’d said it in magazines and he’d said it to friends.‘It was flattering and I found it amusing. He was a kind of cheeky manboy with a captivating smile who got what he wanted.’She added: ‘I’ve never felt I was much older than Harry anyway. I still feel 18 and probably act that way half the time — all those years in kids’ telly probably didn’t help.‘Although it was just a bit of fun we decided it was best to keep it to ourselves, as we were both working for Simon (Cowell).‘We were both single, we got on well and we had a laugh.’ The pair split in early 2012 due to external pressures when the relationship became public.Sam Smith’s manager Jack Street was Caroline’s boyfriend between 2013 and 2014, for 18 months. He was again much younger than Caroline, by eight years.They split after Caroline discovered he had cheated on her with American actress Dianna Agron from Glee.Then in 2015, Caroline was spotted with Jack at Glasto, sparking rumours of a reunion, and indeed they did get back together for a time.But later than year she slammed him for ‘ruining the best day of her life’ by being pictured with a pretty girl on Instagram the day she was starting her X Factor hosting gig with Olly Murs.She first appeared to attack Sam Smith for uploading the picture, and then wrote beside a picture on Instagram: ‘When someone who knows you more than anyone ruins the biggest day of your life.’After being linked to a few Love Island contestants, like ‘Muggy’ Mike Thalassitis, as well as her pals Olly Murs and James Arthur, Caroline got a new boyfriend in 2018.He was a reality star of a different kind, as he’d risen to fame on The Apprentice and then took part in Celebrity Big Brother, where he got close to Courtney Act.Andrew Brady, 27, met Caroline at a party in east London and he moved in with her in March 2018 before they got engaged in April.The engagement came a month after the pair were seen rowing in the street, apparently over accusations that Andrew had cheated on her with a dancer.He strenuously denied the claims, saying of the girl in question: ‘I have never seen this woman in my life.’After getting engaged the couple jetted off for a holiday together to celebrate.MORE: Three centenarians say the secret to living to 100 is staying singleMORE: When is the next full moon?"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_9659054.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"katie price caught cigarette larks friends wearing giant lungs charity","story":"Katie Price might have some explaining to do (picture: Getty Images)Katie Price has been caught red handed.Horrible jokes aside, the personality was seen holding a cigarette days after wearing a giant set of lungs as she took on the London Marathon for British Lung Foundation – and her mother, Amy, who suffers a terminal lung condition.The 39-year-old was seen playing around the front lawns of a pub during the week, larking about with a display of stellar dance moves, before she appeared to strike up while talking with a few choice pals 48 hours after the marathon last Sunday.Katie looked to be having a wow of a time (picture: Flynet)She was seen playfully jumping about, outside the inn, as a friend watched on laughing, dropping her phone as she put on the display.The mother-of-five was then seen chatting with two friends in the carpark with the cigarette in her hand.The personality was seen holding a cigarette (picture: Flynet)It was the first time Katie had been seen in public following the marathon, when she bowed out before the 15km mark due to injury.The Loose Women panelist was seen walking along the course in a giant pair of pink lungs as she raced for the BLF.The internet was trying to find the star – after she vanished from the marathon’s public tracker after crossing the 10km point – but it turned out she’s rejoined her family for a spot of ice cream and then for a coffee break.While she was slammed by some as she revealed she hadn’t been able to fully train, however a source told : ‘Katie did her best and set out to do her best.‘In her mum’s eyes did her PB – personal best – all for charity giving up precious free time she dedicate to family.’While Amy shared her pride in her daughter for raising awareness for the organisation. contacted reps for comment.If you\u0027ve got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the  Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we\u0027d love to hear from you.MORE: Katie Price leaves fans feeling queasy after sharing gruesome video of facial treatmentMORE: Katie Price thanks surgeon for ‘new face’ as she wows fans with makeover that leaves her ‘looking like a doll’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/scarlett-moffatt-and-ant.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"scarlett moffatt addresses ludicrous ant mcpartlin dating rumours sham fitness dvd","story":"Fans predicted a romance between Ant and Scarlett (Picture: Instagram)Scarlett Moffatt has finally opened up about the rumours she was dating Saturday Night Takeaway co-star Ant McPartlin.And, quite frankly, she finds them ludicrous.The 27-year-old Geordie opened up in a candid interview about the saucy reports, after a photo of the two was spied in a frame next to her bed.‘This came about from a few tweets from random people with, like, two followers,’ she told Mail Online about the rumours.Ant and Scarlett worked together, and nothing more (picture: REXShutterstock) ‘And then some journalists turned those tweets into a story. That’s not a story. Ant is like my big brother. It’s so ludicrous it didn’t even warrant a response. Everyone who knows us knows how silly it is. I can laugh about it.’While she wouldn’t be drawn on commenting about Ant and Dec – the former of which has just been released from an intensive month-long treatment for alcohol and emotional issues, following  a drink-driving charge – she did want everyone to know how ‘amazing’ they both were.The star – who recently split with her boyfriend Lee Wilkinson – also opened up for the first time about the reported ‘sham DVD’ that saw the bubbly star dragged over hot coals by the public for reportedly heading to a Swiss boot camp to lose weight while filming her Superslim Me Plan.It was claimed she survived on only 700 calories a day, as opposed to the 1200 purported in her DVD.She said on the day the news broke, outing the reported details behind the DVD, she was strangely ‘happy’ because it meant there was nothing worse going on the world if she’s on the front page.However, Scarlett hoped the whole debacle – of which she couldn’t go into too much detail about, due to legal reasons – ended on a positive, and that it could kickstart important conversation about how women were seen in the spotlight.‘Oh my God, I’ve cried so much,’ she added about the scandal. ‘I get why I was on the front of every newspaper. In a way, I’m almost relieved and hope we can turn it into a positive, start a conversation about the way we criticise and talk about women. All the news articles focus on how I look.

But then no other senior royals have yet visited the latest addition to the family.The Queen, who is at Windsor, was informed by phone about the birth.

Even Fergie’s daughter Princess Eugenie turned up to welcome the arrival of her first cousin once removed.For Charles, languishing in Scotland, the pain must be considerable.To many puzzled observers it may seem that the neglect in not yet having seen his new grandson, when the Middletons have, must lie with the Prince of Wales. But is that the case?On Wednesday, he understandably had to put duty first, travelling to northern France for the dawn ceremony marking Anzac Day and the centenary of the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. A long-planned trip, it involved the prime ministers of France and Australia.All the same, there was a sense of unease among courtiers this week as the prince found himself relegated behind William’s in-laws in the queue to see the latest addition to the House of Windsor.Despite the fact no other senior royals have called in to see the baby, the prince’s absence shines an uncomfortable light on the tricky and perplexing relationship between father and son.We have been here before, of course. Three years ago, Charles complained that he ‘almost never’ sees his first grandson, Prince George, and that he occupied a peripheral role in the little boy’s life.The dismay at seeing less than he expected of his first grandson was amplified because he hoped to become a mentor to the future king.Just a few days before George was born, Charles was happily asking a ladies’ circle for ‘any hints’ on being a grandfather.The anticipation was clear, and it was obvious to those ladies that Charles was determined to be the attentive and loving grandfather he never knew himself.The prince was only three when George VI died, and he never knew his paternal grandfather, Prince Philip’s playboy father Prince Andrew of Greece, who died in 1944.It is not difficult to see how this sparked his desire to be involved in the development of young George, particularly as Charles feels they have a special connection.For he knows that, like himself, George is probably going to have to wait almost a lifetime before he fulfils his destiny. But from the outset, according to insiders, William’s attitude was somewhat different. ‘Very strange,’ says one.On the day Kate’s labour began at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, Charles was on a train en route to a day of engagements.He had offered to cancel his duties, but was assured it was not necessary because William did not want visitors to come to the hospital immediately, fearing they would be disruptive. Instead, George’s first visitors were the Middletons, which established a pattern that, tellingly, repeated itself this week.When Kate’s due date with Princess Charlotte emerged, the same instruction not to visit and not to cancel engagements followed. But as a royal aide noted: ‘The Middletons don’t do engagements, so it didn’t apply to them.’In the event, Charlotte was born at the weekend and Kate quickly went home to Kensington Palace. When it became clear to Charles that the Middletons would be visiting, he made an immediate decision to go, driving himself and Camilla from Highgrove.According to a friend, he felt it would ‘look awful’ if he didn’t visit his new granddaughter at the same time as the Middletons.He was said to have ‘hared’ down the motorway to London, and even radioed ahead to London for an aide to collect a gift from Clarence House which Camilla had chosen for the baby, to be sent over to Kensington Palace.In the event, Granny Carole and Grandpa Charles arrived at the palace almost at the same time.‘When it suits him, William can be friendly and welcoming, but he can also be aloof and icy,’ says a close figure. ‘With his father, he can be cordial or effusive, especially if he wants more money, as he did for work on Anmer Hall – his house in Norfolk. He dispenses niceties like he is the owner of a sweet shop to a small child.’Nothing illustrates this wilful approach better than William’s reaction after Charles included a picture on his desk of him with George – alongside photographs of William and Harry – for one of the regular in-house videos the Prince of Wales makes for his charities in Commonwealth countries.William complained bitterly, even though the picture was one that had been issued publicly.Nor, say friends, has he made any secret of the fact that he views the relationship that Carole and Mike Middleton enjoy with their children as being just what he covets for his own family.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that he doesn’t think he has had that kind of relationship with his father.For Charles, who wants only to be a mentor and sounding board for his sons and his grandchildren, it is not just a puzzling situation. It is also a sad one.

The parents of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Carole and Michael Middleton, have a history of people being named Arthur and Charles in their family trees           Frank Lupton, pictured, is Michael Middleton\u0027s great-great grandfather and Kate’s great-great-great grandfather          Joyce Ransome, wife of Kate’s great-grandmother Olive Lupton’s cousin Hugo, with sons Arthur and Francis Lupton          A simplified take on Kate Middleton\u0027s Lupton ancestry shows where she may have drawn inspiration for her newborn\u0027s middle names           Francis Lupton was killed during the First World War and is an ancestor of the Duchess of Cambridge, who announced her baby\u0027s name today          Kate’s great-grandmother Olive Lupton’s cousin, Hugh, is here pictured during the First World War           Kate’s great-grandmother Olive Lupton’s cousin Hugo, top-right, on his wedding day to Joyce Ransome, sister of Arthur Ransome          Writer Arthur Ransome was also revealed to be related to the Duchess of Cambridge, whose son\u0027s middle name matches the author\u0027s Their son Charles was the first Lupton to go to public school, setting a tradition that would carry right through the family to Kate.All four brothers became prominent figures in Leeds public life: Francis and Arthur ran the family firm Charles headed legal firm Dibb Lupton and Hugh was chairman of Hathorn Davey \u0026amp Co, a hydraulic engineering company. Together, the tentacles of their influence reached across the city.But the family was also struck by tragedy.Arthur’s wife Harriot, who was a cousin of Beatrix Potter’s mother Helen, died in childbirth in 1888, at the age of 35, before her famous cousin published her first children’s book The Tale of Peter Rabbit, leaving her husband a widower with three children Arthur, two, Elinor, one, and baby Elizabeth.

Forensic artist...William¿s touching tribute to his father¿s tragic mentor:...Share this articleFour decades later, catastrophe struck again - and Arthur, who was pro-vice-chancellor of Leeds University, was again left bereft - when his oldest son Arthur, was involved in a horrific riding accident.On 14 December 1928, while riding with the Bramham Hunt, his horse failed to take a fence, throwing him to the ground, rolling on top of him and fracturing his pelvis. Within 11 months he was dead. A year later his father Arthur succumbed to grief.It was Hugo Lupton, son of Arthur’s younger brother Hugh and cousin of Kate’s great-grandmother Olive, who was responsible for linking the Luptons to Arthur Ransome.An old Wellingtonian and Trinity College alumnus, who won a Military Cross for his service in France, he married the author’s sister Joyce in 1920 and had four children Francis, in 1921, Arthur, in 1924, Cecily, in 1927, and Geoffrey, in 1930, ensuring the name Arthur went down through the generations.

Her paternal grandfather and uncle were both known as Charlie, although they were both christened Stephen Charles.The elder Charlie Goldsmith – Kate’s great-grandfather – was born at home in Acton, Middlesex, in 1886, and brought up in Southall. When he left home he lived in Uxbridge, where he worked as a mechanic and met his future wife Edith.A tiny woman, under 5 ft tall and weighing 7 stone, she was disfigured by a huge scar on her torso, which she had got during a narrow escape from death when she was a toddler.‘Grandad used to light his cigar in his big oil stove in the hall of the big house where they lived,’ his daughter Alice Tomlinson, the only one of his children still alive at 106 told me.‘He would roll a piece of paper up and put it in the stove and light his cigar. of course, when he went out, my mum copied. She had a go doing the same thing and nearly burned herself to death.’Charlie and Edith got married at Uxbridge Register office in 1909. She was four months pregnant with their eldest child, whom they named after his father.When Charlie Jnr was five years old, his father signed up, serving in France with the Royal Fusiliers, initially in the trenches and afterwards in the cookhouse. He was one of Kitchener’s ‘shilling men’.Luckily, he survived the war but returned home with emphysema. The father-of-six died in 1938, when his oldest son Charlie was 28 years old, and his youngest son, Kate’s grandfather Ronald was just six years old. His widow Edith was forced to move into a condemned flat and go to work at the local factory.Less than a century later, their great-granddaughter is living in Kensington Palace.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/20/4B77441D00000578-0-image-m-21_1524856582755.jpg","title":"Is royal baby look like","story":"    How a forensic artist predicted Prince Louis of Cambridge will look in years to comeThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have finally revealed the name of their newborn son, and this is how he could look in years to come.A forensic artist, who is based in Washington D.C, studied recent photographs of Prince William, Kate and their two eldest children.Joe Mullins then put together an image of what he predicts Prince Louis will look like in the future.According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeks.He has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew up.At the time Mr Mullins\u0027 pictures suggested that the children would both have dark hair and blue eyes.  Royalists and bookmakers alike have waited patiently since Monday to find out the name of the new arrival and fifth in line to the throne.     Joe Mullins has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew upThe name serves as a poignant tribute to Prince Charles\u0027 beloved great-uncle, mentor and \u0027honorary grandfather\u0027, Lord Mountbatten, who was killed in 1979 when the IRA placed a bomb in his fishing boat.   More than 100,000 bets were placed across the UK betting industry on the baby name, with both Albert and Arthur leading the way as the bookmakers\u0027 favourite.Legoland to give free entry to anyone called Louis after...Share this articleBut William and Kate have plumped for a moniker used for centuries across the Channel by the French, who have had 18 kings called Louis.    Following the baby\u0027s arrival, Prince Harry shifts down the line of succession to sixth place. The Duke of York, who was born second in line, has moved to seventh and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to eighth and ninth.             According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeksAndrew falling out of the top six means he will no longer have to ask the Queen for permission to marry - unlike Charles, William, George, Charlotte and Harry.The first six people in the line of succession must have the Queen\u0027s consent before they can marry on May 19, as set out by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.The act\u0027s introduction also saw sex removed as a determining factor in the line of succession.It has also been claimed that the royal baby has been born a commoner.Royal historian Marlene Koenig told Town and Country: \u0027It sounds complicated, but in the UK, the only people who are not commoners are the Sovereign and peers of the realm, Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, and Baron.\u0027  It was always thought that William and Kate would go on to have three children.Kate is one of three and had a happy home life with her sister, Pippa Matthews, and brother, James Middleton, and is close to both of her siblings.But William may need to adjust to caring for a newborn once again.Kate joked in the months leading up to her due date that her husband was \u0027in denial\u0027 about having a third.By having more than two children, William and Kate are following in the footsteps of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who went on to have four children - although there was a gap of 10 years between their second child, Anne, and third, Andrew. Is this what royal baby could look like?

Shortly afterwards, Mr Elphicke was told the payment had gone through, the woman was withdrawing her complaint and the relevant files had been ‘destroyed’.Mr Elphicke’s friends also challenge the woman’s claim that he touched her leg while driving her to his constituency after the alleged ‘fondling’ incident.‘Much later in the day of the alleged leg touching, he dropped her off at a station so she could get the train home and she never mentioned it then or afterwards,’ said one.The ‘lunge’ complaint by a lobbyist surfaced two days after Mr Elphicke was suspended by Mr Smith. Police told the MP that the woman claimed he had ‘put his arm around her and leaned in to kiss her’ in a Commons lift in May 2015 after they had drinks in Parliament’s Pugin Room.Mr Elphicke denied it and said the woman’s claim was undermined by the fact that in the intervening period she had stayed in touch and regularly asked him out to drinks and dinner. He showed police one text message which she signed off with a friendly ‘X.’The MP had first met the lobbyist as part of his work for the Commons Treasury Select Committee. They had also discussed the possibility of her working for him as a press officer.That became impractical after the 2015 Election, when Mr Elphicke became a Whip – by custom, office holders do not speak in public. He invited her to the Pugin Room to break the news to her over a drink.Afterwards, he escorted her to the Commons exit via a lift.The MP told police they retained cordial relations for the next two and half years – until she complained to Tory HQ two days after his suspension in November 2017.Mr Elphicke declined to comment last night and Downing Street said: ‘We cannot comment on an ongoing police inquiry.’A spokesman for Mr Smith said he ‘robustly denied’ referring allegations against Mr Elphicke to police ‘in an effort to support suspension of the whip’ or that he knew of some allegations ‘some time before they were referred to the police’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/28/23/4BA7E7A100000578-0-image-a-12_1524955729883.jpg","title":"Gosh Meghan POSH youve got Victoria Beckham leads new royal pal follows","story":"Keep cosy in an AllSaints jumper like MeghanMeghan Markle and Prince Harry marked International Women\u0026#39s Day 2018 with a visit to Birmingham aimed at inspiring girls to pursue careers in science, engineering and technology.Looking super chic, Meghan sported a nautical-inspired J.Crew coat over her black trousers and a white AllSaints jumper.

The vote, which is expected in June, could potentially trigger the collapse of her Government if it binds her to stay in the union.It came as Mr Davis used an interview yesterday to poke fun at Mrs May.Asked if he would run for PM if she fell under a bus, Mr Davis replied: ‘The bus wouldn’t dare.’The source close to Mr Davis said: ‘No part of the conversation between Mr Barwell and Mr Davis was about Mr Robbins being sacked.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/28/22/4BA7147200000578-0-image-m-121_1524950256721.jpg","title":"Roads Scottish towns set slowest Europe new 20mph speed limit","story":"    A draft law setting 20mph as the nation’s ‘default speed limit’ in every village, town and city is to be launched in the Scottish Parliament within weeksThe Scottish Government is keeping an ‘open mind’ about a nationwide approach.

His father left farming to become a dental technician, and  the family subsequently moved to Santa Monica, California.When Dean was just nine-years-old, his mother died of cancer. Unable to look after his son alone, his father sent him to live with his aunt and uncle on a farm in Fairmount, Indiana, where he was raised in a Quaker background.

He dropped out in January 1951 to pursue an acting career full-time and moved to New York City.Three years later, he caught the attention of director Elia Kazan, while portraying a gay houseboy in the play, The Immoralist.   With John Steinbeck’s approval, Kazan cast Dean in a screen adaptation of Steinbeck’s novel, East of Eden, launching him into stardom. A lover of speed, he reportedly used part of his advance for East of Eden to buy a red convertible and a motorcycle. He later purchased a white Porsche Super Speedster, which he used to compete in road races.The contract for his next film, Giant, banned him from racing, but upon finishing the film, he traded in the Speedster for the more powerful Porsche 550 Spyder, which he nicknamed \u0027Little Bastard\u0027.           Giant, which starred Dean alongside Elizabeth Taylor, was the young actor\u0027s second filmOn the very same day as his fatal crash, a police officer fined Dean for going 65 mph in a 55 mph zone.

One of them, Jonas Bendiksen, a Norwegian photographer, has won international awards for his pictures of people just about as far away from home as can be – from isolated communities in newly independent states of the former Soviet Union to a book of photographs of urban slums around the world.Turning his camera toward the intimate, Bendiksen used the opportunity to track the arrival of his new baby daughter, Billie, through his wife Anna’s pregnancy to the birth. In publishing the pictures in Magnum’s book Bendiksen, who has a photojournalist’s distrust of the familiar, is apologetic about them. “These are some of the most important pictures I’ll ever take,” he notes. “But not because they are necessarily very interesting for others to see.” You have the sense he needn’t have worried.The picture on this page was the last of the home photographs Bendiksen took, showing Billie adrift on a table top amid the familiar plastic detritus of a children’s party. The deep infant sleep carries with it not only an ever-present trace of parental anxiety – what if Billie should roll? – but also an edge of lovely private comedy: what kind of world, of half-drunk dregs and abandoned shades and empty chairs has this child fallen into? In this week when baby photographs have been front-page news, it also goes to prove what newspaper picture editors have long known – that no other subject moves so effortlessly from the particular to the universal.Home, a collaboration between Fujifilm and Magnum Photos, runs from 18-27 May 2018 at the Vinyl Factory, London W1.

I check my watch: it’s five to two. “It’s not going to work today,” he sighs. “But this isn’t really work, this is just blah blah blah, it’s easy. The hard thing is writing things in the studio and thinking of stuff that’s interesting.”An afternoon nap might sound indulgent, but it is hard to fault 49-year-old Shrigley’s work ethic. An excellent new book is imminent: Fully Coherent Plan for a New and Better Society features 254 new illustrations, all drawn in his distinctive thick black pen on stark white paper, the naivety of the image offset by the scabrous, surreal or darkly comic text. He’s also the guest director of the 2018 Brighton festival (he moved to Brighton three years ago with his wife, Kim, and miniature schnauzer Inka, after 27 years in Glasgow). Shrigley has been involved in selecting performers for the festival – which features everything from art to comedy to music to a lot that is indescribable – and will be making several appearances himself.To that end, below us, in a large room that still has the stained-glass windows and pulpit from its days as a church, the finishing touches are being applied to Shrigley’s installation Life Model II. The work, which revisits a piece he made when he was nominated for the Turner prize in 2013, is an imposing 9ft nude woman with a severe fringe and long eyelashes that blink every so often. Surrounding the model are easels, paper and drawing materials, and visitors are invited to make a “life” drawing. These will then be tacked to the gallery walls and, in Shrigley’s mind, become artwork just as interesting as his original sculpture, if not more so.The show hasn’t yet opened when we meet, so on the walls are some examples from the last time Life Model II was shown, in Vienna, which will act as a “giddy-up” to the people of Brighton. “So they are drawings by Austrians,” says Shrigley, as though this fact might explain a lot.Life Model II is a just part of Shrigley’s contribution to the festival. What’s really disrupting his sleep right now is a new work called Problem in Brighton, which is billed as “an alt-rock pantomime” starring Pauline Knowles and Gavin Mitchell. In some ways it’s a companion piece to Shrigley’s 2011 “opera”, Pass the Spoon, but the truth is that even the artist is unsure what it will look and sound like.“I’ve always wanted to direct a performance on stage,” says Shrigley. “I did the opera thing a few years ago, but I didn’t direct that, I just wrote the words. But the word ‘pantomime’ suggests, ‘oh well, it’s a pantomime, it’s like a rubbish, funny play for children’. Then you say it’s ‘alt-rock’… I didn’t say ‘avant-garde’, because that’s pretentious. Basically I’ve set the bar really low, so I can do whatever I like and make a cacophonous noise.”Doing something totally different clearly appeals to Shrigley. Alongside his best-known work – the books and merch his 2012 solo show, Brain Activity, at London’s Hayward gallery his huge bronze thumb, titled Really Good, which until last month sat on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square – he is also drawn to more esoteric commissions. In 2015, he designed a new mascot for the Scottish football club Partick Thistle he’s called Kingsley and looks like a furious sun. He’s made music videos for Blur and Bonnie Prince Billy, and hosted pop-up tattoo stations, at which he draws directly on to people’s bodies and, if they like the result, they can have it inked permanently.Now, for the Observer, Shrigley is submitting himself to interrogation by our readers. At 6ft 5in, he’s not hard to spot – does he generally have pleasant interactions with the public? “They give me the fear, if I’m honest,” says Shrigley. “In Glasgow it used to be, ‘You’re that guy, aren’t ye?’ And I’d be like, ‘Aye, I am.’ Then he’d say, ‘I thought you were, right, I think you’re that guy. All the best to ye.’”Shrigley laughs, “The thing is, who was he talking about? Was he talking about me? We’ll never know.”Hans-Ulrich Obrist, artistic director of the Serpentine Galleries Don’t listen to people like me. Or Hans-Ulrich. There’s that famous statement: every generation invents rock’n’roll, or whatever it is, for itself. And every generation invents its art anew. So, don’t find excuses not to do it. I’m sure a lot of young people have more excuses than I did when I was in my early 20s: I was lucky, there were no fees to pay then. But yeah, if you want to do it, get on with it.Yinka Shonibare, artistTommy Cooper was funny. The thing about Tommy Cooper is that he walked on to the stage and people laughed. That’s magic, isn’t it? If you can just look at people and they start laughing. I’m not really a nostalgic person, but when I watch things from the 1970s, when I was a little kid, The Two Ronnies and Dad’s Army are still funny. I couldn’t really say that about a lot of other things that have happened in the interim.I like standup, but I don’t go to it often. When it’s good, you always think: “Why don’t I do this more often?” Just laughing for a whole hour, it’s so therapeutic. But then you see something that isn’t that funny and you’re like, “Shall we go to the bar?” and you realise why you don’t do it so often. It’s very subjective as well. My wife and I went to see Stewart Lee and then we went to see an American guy whose name I can’t remember. She really liked the American guy and didn’t like Stewart Lee. And I was like: “How can you not like Stewart Lee?” And she said, “I think it’s a man thing. He’s just so bloody clever.” And that’s a criticism. That’s part of the reason I like him: because he is so bloody clever. Anyway, subjective, innit?Jess Kidd, authorRight, a bank holiday weekend – because it’s bound to be raining, isn’t it? So you’re indoors with this bloody ghost. I’m actually reading Jess Kidd’s book at the moment, which is all about ghosts. Anyway, who would it be? It would have to be Duchamp, because he could perhaps teach me to play chess – he was one of the best chess players in France. People have taught me to play chess before but it’s never stuck, so I’d like to go over it with him. And I could sit there in the park playing and tell people: “Well, Marcel Duchamp taught me to play…” Actually no: “The ghost of Marcel Duchamp taught me to play chess.” That would be cool.It would probably take longer than a weekend. Obviously there’d be a lot of questions I’d want to ask him: Duchamp is a kind of god, or a touchstone. And if Duchamp wasn’t available then Andy Warhol, but Duchamp would be my first choice.Sir Nicholas Serota, chair of Arts Council EnglandWell, I live in Brighton, so that’s really handy. And part of the reason they need a guest director as a marketing figurehead is because it is so disparate in terms of the things that are on. It’s very difficult to pull them all together into one unified blurb, other than: it’s here and there’s lots of really good things on. My programming was basically sending a list by email to somebody and, fortunately for me, a lot of the things came to be. So Deerhoof and Ezra Furman and Bridget Christie among others: Deerhoof are one of my favourite bands, Ezra Furman I’ve never seen before and Bridget Christie, I missed her show as well. So it was a way of filling in the gaps and not having to go to London and get the vomit express back at the end of the evening.Emma Jane Unsworth, authorWho! Who! Who! I let the dog out at 6am, and I don’t know why she wakes up at 6am but it’s always me that has to take her out. And it’s only when we’re in Brighton. We spend part of our time in Devon and she gets up at 8am when we’re in Devon. I think it’s the seagulls that wake her up here. Anyway, I’ve taken to wearing shorts in bed, so I don’t have to take my pyjamas off, I just go out in shorts and a coat and wander like a zombie around the block. She does what she has to do and then we go back to bed for another two hours.Evie Wyld, novelistI don’t like frogs and toads very much. They look, particularly toads, like dirt when you see them from a distance. I saw one on the doorstep the other day and I thought it was dog shit. I wish them well, toads, I wish them long, healthy lives, but if you said, “Would you like me to put a toad on your bare chest right now?” I’d say: “Absolutely not.”Ezra Furman, musicianI think they’re both. For some people they can be quite annoying, if you look at them too much. I’m aware of that. As an artist, you have to do what you’ve gotta do. There is some cathartic thing about making art: if you don’t get it out, it’ll fester inside and damage you somehow. I do feel a bit like that. So it’s healthy for me to make art whether it’s healthy for other people to look at it, I don’t know.Amanda Palmer, singerI guess so, but sometimes I misunderstand lyrics. There’s a famous old blues song called He’s a Mighty Good Leader Beck did a version of it on one of his early albums. I really liked it, but I always thought the lyric was, “Is the monarch a leader?” and it was only fairly recently that the Beck album was reissued on vinyl and I realised, Oooh… yeah: is the monarch a leader? And a picture of the royal family: are they a leader? Or is it just a token office?I’ve made a couple of pop promos in my life. I’d do it for Beck but not for anybody else. Now Mark E Smith is dead, Beck is probably the only one I’d do it for. But not this year, I’m too busy.Matt Haig, novelist (who lives in Brighton)I love it. It was hard to leave Glasgow and Brighton was probably the one other place I’ve always felt really at home. It’s my kind of people in Brighton, it’s by the sea, and the weather’s better than Glasgow.But it depends where you live as well. I’ve never actually met Matt but we have a friend in common, so doubtless I will soon. I think he lives in Hove, while I’m in Kemptown. The bad thing about Kemptown is that it’s full of dogshit and lunatics. And I suspect Hove isn’t. I’m not talking about homeless people, I’m just talking about genuinely mad people, barking at the moon, who live in houses and who are mad. To wit, the day after we moved in, I’d parked the car on the pavement and I was unloading it. Some guy was walking down the street and he was wearing a pair of shorts, flip-flops, a cowboy hat and a pair of sunglasses, and he had “Get High” written in lipstick on his chest. This was about 8.30am and he was smoking a joint and he said: “You can’t park like that, mate. I’m just telling ya.”Now, I like that, but I’d like to be like the people who come from a different part of town just to visit, to look at Mr Get High.Ed Vaizey, Conservative MP for WantageOh yeah, I know your mum. My mum lives with maybe two and they are both ceramic pieces, because she threw away all the rest. She and my dad between them discarded all of my work, probably shortly after I left home for art school. I’d say they’ve come to appreciate it a bit more over time. There was a watershed moment where there was some documentary about me on TV and overnight they went from knowing nothing to everything about what I did for a living. That’s not to say my parents haven’t been supportive, because they have they just didn’t really have any interest in art.Also, to be fair to them, I’m slightly less bothered about them throwing the artwork away than I was about them throwing away all my football programmes. I had the programme to the 1979 European Cup final, Nottingham Forest’s moment of glory. Don’t know where that is. Gone.Peter Jenkinson, co-founder of Culture+ConflictWell, it can’t always tell you which artworks are mine and which works just look like mine, for example. On Google image search there are works that are erroneously attributed to me, and then people invite you to participate in something that they’re curating and they say: “We love your work! Could we reproduce this image on the brochure?” And it’s not one of your images. Then you have to say: “You don’t like my work as much as you think you do.” So Google image search – problem.Dan Guthrie, Stroud, GloucsThe difficult thing about answering any question about what is or isn’t art is that even before you’ve finished making the statement as to what art is or what art isn’t, you think of an exception, a contradiction to what you’ve just said. You realise you’re wrong even before you’ve finished saying it.But, just for the sake of argument: stuff that’s in hotel rooms. Authorless, inkjet prints on canvas, you have to say that isn’t really art. It just looks like art but it isn’t art.Ally Ferguson, GlasgowIt’s very difficult to say. When I was looking for somewhere to study, I found Glasgow really exciting and different and mysterious. It was everything the suburbs of Leicester, where I grew up, weren’t. It probably took about 12 years for that to wear off and then suddenly I realised I was sort of a Glaswegian. This was my home. I can’t really remember my childhood in the East Midlands that well, but Glasgow is still very vivid. I lived there from when I was 19 to when I was 47 – teenage to middle age – and it was only three years ago that I left – it’s the biggest part of my life.Emma Richardson, BedfordGlad you enjoyed it. I guess when you make something that you invite somebody to draw, it’s going to look like what you’ve made. But their drawings can also be a critique of the work, perhaps, and it’s an acknowledgement that everybody sees an artwork differently – on a metaphorical level as well as a literal level. What I like about it is that it’s a nice inclusive work. I tend to hate all the big sculptures I’ve made after a while. But I like this one because I don’t look at it any more, I look at the people’s drawings, so it’s like going to a different exhibition every time. I just ignore the big person.Matt Wilson, MadridLeighton BuzzardYeah, the most difficult thing is to know whether it’s any good. That tends to change depending on what mood you’re in. Knowing whether it’s finished? Well, with a drawing, it has to be because all of the paper is covered. Then it’s definitely finished.William Tallan, AyrshireNo. We are not getting relegated, first of all. At the time of writing, we’ve got to play Ross County and we’ve got to play Hamilton. Win both of those games, we could feasibly be out of the shit we’re in. So first of all let’s think positive. Second of all, no. I’m not going to update Kingsley. Kingsley will be as he is and he will be there next season if we have to achieve promotion again.Selma Montford , honorary secretary of the Brighton Society 1973-2016I don’t think it’s clever, for the record. And it’s my handwriting, right, so what you’re objecting to is my handwriting. It’s like you’re basically objecting to me and there’s nothing I can do about that. I accept that. That’s why I don’t correspond by social media. It’s transmit only, I’m afraid, with social media. Because otherwise you’re just opening yourself – it’s a conduit to everyone in the world, some of whom are going to be really nasty to you.Sion Williams, Ruthin, north WalesYes, I do have a Moleskine notebook, as you might imagine, as every other note-taker does. I was in Glasgow one day, before we left, in the Botanic Gardens near where we lived, and I was making a little drawing, sitting on a bench. I overheard two guys walking past and they went: “Police.” How far from the truth can you be?Stefano Turato, EdinburghSelf-delusion probably. I’ve come to realise that self-delusion is quite important if you want to be an artist: “Oh, that doesn’t tally with my view of myself” – just ignore it. That’s the way my brain works. If you want to do something, you’ve got to ignore things that are unhelpful and that’s what I do.Mike Abbott, Limoges, FranceIt is my finger, yes. I think it’s my left hand because I’ve got a wonky nail on my left hand where my school friends trod on my finger when I was 10. Does it reference Lord Kitchener? In a sense the image functions in the same way as that famous recruitment poster but it isn’t a direct reference to that image.I don’t really make photographs any more – I stopped after the changeover to digital. Though that might be a digital picture actually, but I mostly stopped making photographic art in the early 2000s. I just stopped being interested in physical paper photographs. You start taking pictures on your phone and now there’s Instagram and that somehow seems to be enough: to make digital images and stick them on there.Luke, CopenhagenYeah, it’s a bad idea it’s been done. We’ve all got to be unique. Get “Finger” tattooed on your toe, that’s my advice. As far as I know that hasn’t been done and I’ll happily provide the text.Fully Coherent Plan for a New and Better Society is out on Thursday (Canongate, £14.99).

The painting was the last to be completed in a series in which the artist portrayed the Resurrection in the context of a regatta in the Berkshire village of Cookham.Sotheby’s, which is auctioning the painting, will ​briefly exhibit it to allow Spencer enthusiasts a rare sighting. It was last on public view at Worthing Art Gallery in the autumn of 1961.Spencer planned seven paintings in the series Christ Preaching at Cookham Regatta. Six smaller works were completed, but the enormous centrepiece was unfinished. It now hangs in the Stanley Spencer Gallery in Cookham, the artist’s beloved home village.Punts by the River, completed in 1958, like all Spencer’s Cookham paintings, connects epic and domestic themes. It depicts a group of girls in summer dresses, sitting in a punt. The low, cushioned seats mean their simple summer dresses ride up to show off a tangle of bare limbs.The girls were likely to be based on villagers known to the artist, said Frances Christie, Sotheby’s head of modern and postwar British art. “They’re probably working at the regatta, taking a break. These punts were an unattainable world, they were really expensive to rent during regatta week.”In the background, a young man, apparently naked, is trying to break into their circle. His bare feet intrude into the girls’ punt and a long bony finger points at the group. It is thought to be a portrayal of Stanley as a young man.“He’s a curious figure, but it’s clearly an image of Spencer in his youth,” said Christie. “The fact that he’s naked and in a contorted pose – almost like an angel or a cherub – is very intriguing. It feels like there’s sacred presence there.”Like all his Cookham paintings, the work is a social commentary on the village. “Everyday goings-on get elevated because he uses religious subject matter. He saw that using the Christian story was a way of, in his mind, raising his beloved Cookham from an everyday village.”The detail of the painting – the wood of the punt, the cushions, the flesh of the girls’ limbs – make “you almost feel that you’re sitting there with them. It really shows off what an incredible draughtsman he was.”Great works by Spencer rarely come on the market because much is in public collections. “All the major museums in Britain have great Spencers, and they’re also in collections around the world,” said Christie.Christie said she hoped Punts by the River would be bought by “another incredible collector who appreciates it as much as the family who bought it in the late 1950s”.The current record price for a Spencer painting was set in 2013 for another in the series, Christ Preaching at Cookham Regatta: Conversation Between Punts, which fetched £6m.As well as painting grand biblical scenes in the prosaic village setting, Spencer created the most important artistic first world war memorial in the UK, the Sandham Memorial Chapel in Burghclere, Hampshire.An exhibition of works by Spencer commissioned and bought by his patrons – including the unfinished centrepiece of the Christ Preaching at Cookham Regatta series – is currently on show at the Stanley Spencer Gallery in the artist’s home village.Christ Preaching at Cookham Regatta: Punts by the River will be on view to the public as part of Sotheby’s Modern British Week, 8-12 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/765f2dcdd73ebcc0436b6ee3fa59c9402ff7c931/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f83052e1e4a714521ff753ebe83e96e","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The Korean summit, the Bill Cosby verdict, the anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and demonstrations in Gaza – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33d7e265564f635941b5fddecd892e2e54b789a6/0_11_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=348d9adec78abcbcfc80fb6de73a009f","title":"the photography of john reardon","story":"The photographer John Reardon has died at the age of 66.

Sainsbury’s already owns Argos while Asda’s George clothing brand vies with Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Primark to sell the most clothing in volume terms. The enlarged supermarket group would have nearly 3,000 stores and annual sales of more than £50bn.Any proposed deal is likely to be closely scrutinised by the competition watchdog over concerns it would tighten the grip the four major supermarket chains – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – have on the UK grocery market. Analysts also suggest the combination could lead to thousands of job losses as the two chains cut out duplication. The big supermarkets have recently cut thousands of back-office and shopfloor jobs in a drive to cut costs. They are trying to rebuild their profits, which have collapsed as the fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl have stolen shoppers, while online players led by Amazon have sucked sales out of the high street.Mike Coupe, the chief executive of London-based Sainsbury’s, is said to be in the driving seat, making the future of Asda’s Leeds head office look uncertain. A combination of the two groups would be expected to strip out costs by consolidating back-office operations. Asda is run by a former Sainsbury’s executive, Roger Burnley, who quit the group for a more senior role at the rival in 2015.Sainsbury’s confirmed it was in talks with the US retail giant Walmart, which has owned Asda since 1999. “Sainsbury’s confirms that it and Walmart Inc are in advanced discussions regarding a combination of the Sainsbury’s and Asda businesses,” the company said in statement rushed out on Saturday afternoon after Sky News and the newswire Bloomberg both reported the story. Sainsbury’s promised to provide more details to the stock exchange on Monday morning.It has previously been unthinkable that there would be consolidation among the UK’s big four supermarkets because of competition concerns, but the retailers are said to have been emboldened after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) waved through the merger of Tesco and Booker, the UK’s biggest retailer and grocery wholesaler respectively.The deal comes at a time of major upheaval in the retail sector as Aldi and Lidl become increasingly powerful and the cost of running high street stores increases because of higher business rates and labour costs. Sainsbury’s is also looking for ways to shore up its market position in the wake of Tesco’s recent takeover of Booker. That deal increased Tesco’s buying power by creating a food group with sales of £57.5bn.Sainsbury’s has a network of more than 1,400 supermarkets and convenience stores while Asda has around 600 stores. Sainsbury’s also has 800 Argos outlets.“It’s hard to see this being good for consumers,” said Scott Corfe, the chief economist at the Social Market Foundation thinktank. “Recent experience, with the rise of Aldi and Lidl triggering a supermarket price war, supports the case for a less concentrated groceries sector - not a more concentrated one.”It is unclear how the deal between Sainsbury’s and Asda might be structured. Sainsbury’s is listed in London and it is understood US-listed Walmart intends to retain a large shareholding in the enlarged group. Further clarity is expected on Monday. The Usdaw union’s national officer, Joanne McGuinness, said it would be seeking urgent meetings with the businesses to get more detail on what a merger would involve. “Our priorities will be to protect our members and ensure any deal between the retailers does not impact on their jobs or incomes,” she said.If the merger happens it would be biggest shake-up in UK grocery retailing since Morrisons took over Safeway in 2004. Analysts debated the merits of the proposed deal on social media, with many convinced competition concerns would force the companies to sell off a large number of stores.Bryan Roberts, a TCC Global analyst, also questioned the logic of the deal. “I don’t see what problems this solves. They will still be unable to be cheaper than Aldi and Lidl because they have a unique operating model. I was also expect that there would need to be a chunky disposal programme once the CMA has looked at local competition issues.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf55fccc0df00aeb6bfdd09acc9ee8fabefc029a/0_345_1965_1178/master/1965.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09623431595a39d379f2a0301c3d3f3e","title":"theresa may attempt to muddle through brexit fast approaching big crunch","story":"There’s a theory at Westminster that Theresa May is a much cleverer politician than she looks. The world sees a second-rate prime minister trapped in a context that she lacks the strength and agility to escape. That is the cunning disguise adopted by a maestro of manipulation with a remarkable talent for survival. Machiavelli has a sister and she lives at Number 10.She is ruthless at dispatching wounded ministers when it suits her and as ruthless at retaining damaged ministers (Amber Rudd being the topical example) when they can serve the prime minister as human shields. She threw away the Tories’ majority at an election she didn’t have to call and yet somehow endures in Downing Street by convincing her party that she is the only one among them who can keep this rackety government on a rocky road strewn with danger.Consider, most of all, Brexit. It is more than a year since Britain formally told the EU that it was leaving and there are now less than 12 months remaining before departure is due to become historical fact. Many have been the predictions that Mrs May could not possibly keep her brittle government and riven party together through this test. Yet those forecasts have so far been confounded. Her cabinet have fought like rabid ferrets, but not one of them has actually flounced out over Brexit.A guileful prime minister – so goes the theory I have heard from some Tory MPs – has slowly but surely stitched up the hard Brexiters. She made prisoners of David Davis, Liam Fox and Boris Johnson by giving them nominal charge of the negotiations while ensuring that she has called all the essential shots. She took their “red lines” and pretended to agree with them and then let the power of time and the brute facts of the parliamentary arithmetic and economic life do the work of softening Brexit. Those “red lines” have often times been smudged and in some cases erased altogether.The negotiating process with the EU has been punctuated by regular British retreats from the hard-line positions initially advocated by the Brexit fundamentalists. This has involved degrees of humiliation for Mrs May, but nothing that her armoured hide cannot absorb and nothing compared with what has been inflicted on the Brexiters. From fisheries to regulatory alignments, they’ve been forced to eat plates groaning with their previous promises.Where once many of their number declared that they would not countenance paying a red cent to the EU, Britain will be handing over a hefty orce settlement. Where once they ringed the departure date as “liberation day”, they have conceded to a lengthy standstill transition, which means that EU law will prevail in Britain at least until the end of 2020. “Take back control”, the chest-beating slogan of their referendum campaign, has become feeble bleats about “implementation periods” and “managed ergence”. The longer the negotiations have gone on, the more and more evident has it become that there is no bargain with the EU that Britain can strike that is as advantageous as the deal it currently enjoys as a member, not at all the conclusion that the Brexiters wanted to become apparent. As the concessions to reality have piled up, they have huffed and puffed, but never made good on threats to blow the house down. Nigel Farage has been left in a lonely corner of the union jack bar to weep into his beer between moans of betrayal.And now they’ve had enough. The hard Brexiters declare there will be no more surrenders. Like the crazed newscaster in Network, they rage: “I’m mad as hell – and I’m not gonna take it anymore.” There is a red line, they pronounce, which they will not allow the government to cross. If it does, so they threaten, they will tear down the Tory temple.That red line is British membership of a customs union after Brexit. Boris Johnson selected that as the ditch he would die for when he said that remaining within a customs union “would leave the UK a colony of the EU”. In a speech a couple of months ago, Liam Fox termed it “a complete sell-out of Britain’s interests”. It is hard to see how either could stay in a cabinet that negotiated the very thing they have so passionately denounced.Their problem is that they don’t speak for parliament. A recent defeat for the government in the House of Lords, where a substantial majority of peers think Britain should protect its trade with the EU by remaining within a customs union, was an early warning of how much peril this issue poses for Mrs May. As I have remarked before, there is a natural majority in the Commons for remaining within some form of customs union, now that Labour has adopted that course. The great majority of trade unions and most businesses support the idea. The government’s own analysis, which was helpfully leaked, suggests that losses to commerce with our closest neighbours can never be compensated for by the putative gains to be had from negotiating unilateral trade deals with third countries from outside the customs union. Business would rather have the bird in the hand than hypothetical fledglings in theoretical bushes to be raised at some unspecified date in the distant future.Polling suggests that it would be fine with most voters as well. “The will of the people”, that much-loved trope of the hard Brexiters, would not be defied by parliament instructing the government to keep Britain in a customs union. Then there is the wicked issue of the Irish border, a conundrum that induces a migraine in everyone who examines it. Remaining within a customs union doesn’t entirely solve that problem, but it goes a long way to making it fixable.Quite a lot of the cabinet would not be terribly upset if parliament told the government to stay in a customs union. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, would be able to contain their distress if the government was defeated on the issue. Likewise the de facto deputy prime minister, David Lidington.Mrs May’s avowed intention is to leave the customs union and she has said so often and in such unequivocal language that it doesn’t leave her any apparent wriggle room. As recently as last week’s prime minister’s questions, she stuck with the hard Brexiters’ interpretation of the referendum result when she declared: “The British people voted to leave the European Union. In voting to leave the European Union, they voted to leave the single market and the customs union.”On the face of it, that would make it extremely difficult for her to negotiate a customs\u0026nbspunion. So why do hard Brexiters not trust her and why do some of her cabinet speculate that she could embrace the idea if parliament forced her to? Because Mrs May has a reputation for standing on her head while swearing that nothing has changed. You will recall that she said that she was not going to have an early election because it would be contrary to the national interest. This was a position that she maintained relentlessly, all the way up to the point when she suddenly declared that it was in the national interest to have an early election.The hard Brexiters are clearly fearful that there will be a similar volte-face over the EU negotiations and that\u0026nbspBritain will end up in a customs union, or something very similar by a slightly different name. So they are trying to put a gun to her head by predicting that it will trigger cabinet resignations, which I am pretty sure it would, and a full-scale Tory civil war, which would blow away Mrs May’s premiership. They menace her with a confidence vote in her leadership. That wouldn’t change the parliamentary arithmetic, which is the fundamental weakness in their position. Nor would a confidence vote necessarily remove her as prime minister, but it is not a prospect she wants to face, which is why they make the threat.The prime minister has not found an answer to this crunch other than to try to delay it. The government has stalled a chunk of the withdrawal legislation to try to swerve the moment of truth, but it won’t be able to duck a binding vote forever. The great rupture of the Tory party over Brexit cannot be avoided indefinitely. What might look to some like cunning cleverness is, on closer inspection, really an exercise in trying to postpone the inevitable while desperately hoping that something will turn up. Not so much Machiavelli as Mr Micawber."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aef0699dc6af21807db8e9b04fda599db2d229be/2_0_2576_1545/master/2576.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4518f19ae6fea3cc3e9371969b30dd1f","title":"the world is broken sometimes its ok to just be sad about that","story":"In his last column for the  US, writer at large Steven Thrasher writes about when it’s best to take action in life – and when it is fine to just self-reflectThe other night, I started crying and couldn’t stop. I hadn’t cried that hard since my father died 15 years ago. As three more members of my immediate family died in the decade following my dad’s death, I cried less for each one until, eventually, I had no more tears to shed whenever anything sad happened in my life.But the other night, I cried so hard and for so long that I began to wonder if the skin might dissolve away from all the salt running over it. This was triggered by a dear friend moving far away. As I’ve written before, living without parents, partner or dependents has led to me highly appreciate friendship. And though a wondrous thing about living in New York City these past 23 years has been that so many great people pass through this town, they are often doing just that: temporarily passing through. My heart aches each time a kindred soul leaves. Bidding my friend adieu cracked the dam long holding back a rising reservoir of tears. As a columnist, my impetus has been to inspire readers towards action and away from despair in moments of overwhelming sadness. But as I cried in the dark, I gave in to my frustration and despair for a change – and sat with my deep sadness about the state of the world on scales large and small. It was cathartic, and I was reminded that mourning isn’t a sign of weakness, but just of being human.And there is much to mourn right now. I began writing this column during an exciting moment in American history, when LGBT rights were being won in state after state weekly or even daily. I was a bit optimistic about the United States right then. Liberty was on the march, and despite the depressing reasons for its necessity, the ascending spirit of the Black Lives Matter movement gave me a sense of hope. Then, much as I feared and predicted, the backlash roared mightily. From Brexit to Trump, white supremacist empire struck back at modest gains in racial, gender and sexual justice. In my scholarly life, I increasingly learned that such revanchism is not a deviation from US and British hegemony, but rather a repeating condition of their continued dominance. And with good reason, I have felt despondent about much of the news of the past couple of years. I feel sad about how the Anglo-American war machine grows and kills regardless of who’s living on Downing Street (May, Brown or Blair) or in the White House (Trump, Obama, Bush II, Clinton or Bush I). I feel sad about the relentless consolidation, manipulation, and whiteness of US and British media. And about the attacks on science , art, language and medicine. And I am disheartened about the unceasing, ableist and racist police killings. And about Ice raids and lethal transphobia. And about how often Americans call the police on black people for playing with toys, walking with a plumbing fixture, or using a plastic fork in a Waffle House or sitting in Starbucks. And about how black women are underpaid and rushed towards death. And about why “Black infants in America are now more than twice as likely to die as white infants – a racial disparity that is actually wider than in 1850, 15 years before the end of slavery, when most black women were considered chattel,” as Linda Villarosa recently wrote. And the increasing curtailing of sexual freedom through the merger of the state and tech. And about the shaming of the hungry – and the racist lack of power in Puerto Rico and safe water in Flint. Furthermore, the recent golden anniversaries of civil rights dates have been particularly dejecting. Despite a half century passing since the Kerner Commission Report and the assassination of Martin Luther King, there has been “no progress for African Americans on homeownership, unemployment and incarceration in 50 years” as a Washington Post headline surmised.What am I – what are any of us – to do with all this information?For a long time, I wrote and raged about such matters in a call to corrective action. But when that wall of tears flowed forth from my eyes, it occurred to me that perhaps it’s OK to not just be sad, but to sit with being sad.This is tough for me, for I come from a family of activists. My parents were racial justice activists. My sister Jinger and brother James were active in Occupy Los Angeles, and Jinger’s family is active in the “wwoofer” organic farming movement. My sister Catherine is also a committed racial justice activist, as are her inspirational and newsmaking daughters, April and Maddi. Through documenting America in journalism, I have strived to be like my kin in forcing change.But also in our family was my late sister Sharron, who often showed me how it is OK to slow down. As I wrote in 2016, “One of the last and most frightening lessons I learned with my sister in her final days was the importance of being with another when there is nothing to say or do. It is terrifying, to just be with a loved one and to admit you’re powerless to stop their death. But it can be the most powerful, quiet and loving gift you can give each other.”Right now, I am sitting with the importance of being with myself in life when I am unsure of what to do when there is nothing to say or do. It is indeed terrifying to just be with myself in grief or unknowing, and to admit I am powerless to stop every bad thing in the world which concerns me.But I am also considering that it might just be the most powerful, quiet and loving gift I can give myself – a gift which may empower me with time. As a psychologist, my sister Sharron would employ a metaphor about engaging grief which has stayed with me. For someone in mourning, approaching grief can be like moving towards an enormous, dark, cold lake. Not knowing how deep or cold it may be, the griever tries to go around the lake without getting in it. But the lake turns out not to be a lake at all, but rather an endless river. Trying to circumvent this body of water, the griever gets lost in weeds and bramble, straying ever farther from their path. Eventually, they have to get in the lake of grief and swim in its depths, unless they want to remain lost. To that end, this will be my final regular column for the . While I still believe writing is a valuable force for social change, I also believe it is important for writers to take time let our wells refill without publishing. And now it is time for me to not just sit with some sadness about the world, but to prepare for some positive developments in my journey. It is also time, after four years of conducting PhD research, to spend the next year writing my doctoral thesis in American studies at NYU. Then, in in the summer of 2019, I will join the faculty of Northwestern University as the inaugural Daniel H Renberg chair in media coverage of sexual and gender minorities – the first journalism professorship at a major university to focus on LGBTQ subjects and scholarship. Taking this time to be with my feelings and also to get a little smarter will allow me – I hope – to become a professor and empower me in new ways as a writer.I do hope to visit these pages again someday. But before I go, I want to say thank you to my fellow  journalists and to you, our readers, for the experience of a lifetime.

Erik Solheim said governments needed to intensify concrete actions including limiting greenhouse gas emissions, plastic pollution and impacts from agriculture.In a statement issued in advance of Sunday’s announcement, the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the new funding was an investment in the health of the reef and the tourism jobs dependent on it.“Like reefs all over the world, the Great Barrier Reef is under pressure,” Turnbull said. “A big challenge demands a big investment – and this investment gives our reef the best chance.”Turnbull said the reef restoration science associated with the funding would be shared internationally and with Pacific neighbours.“As a highly respected philanthropic organisation, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation has a strong fundraising track record, and will seek corporate contributions to further enhance this work,” the prime minister said.The funding package includes $201m for improving water quality with changed farming practices such as reduced fertiliser use, $100m for reef restoration science, $58m to combat the crown-of-thorns starfish, $45m for community engagement, including drawing on Indigenous traditional knowledge for sea country management, and $40m for monitoring reef health.The study on coral mass mortality, published in Nature and led by Terry Hughes, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies – published in April – examined the link between the level of heat exposure, subsequent coral bleaching and ultimately coral death.“These widespread losses were not due to the attrition of corals that slowly starved because they failed to regain their symbionts. Rather, temperature-sensitive species of corals began to die almost immediately in locations that were exposed to heat stress.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e33f1671c2c1ac0061cc4fbd71c911e930ae273/0_117_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b403ed4bcb047fe6cca03425e1df2e6","title":"chris coleman sackedd manager sunderland","story":"• Sunderland sack manager Chris Coleman after relegation• Club sold to group led by Stewart Donald, chairman of EastleighSunderland owner Ellis Short has agreed to sell the club to a group led by Stewart Donald, the chairman of National League side Eastleigh, the Wearside club have announced.The club has also sacked Chris Coleman as manager.

Eight years after the Boston Red Sox owners, Fenway Sports Group, bought Liverpool and cleared the £200m debt from the dismal 2007 acquisition by Tom Hicks and George Gillett, the club have been greatly renewed. Their old ground, in which supporters’ songs recall European adventures under Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley, has been transformed by the booming new £114m main stand and the strolling and shopping space outside that was claimed around it.It may seem an odd fate for the few people who were left in Lothair Road and one side of Alroy Road after 20 years of shocking blight, to be moved and the three rows knocked down to make way for that space, but Liverpool have done it up tastefully. It is not all about the new corporate areas and megastore and the Hilton hotel shortly expected to be announced the memorial to the 96 people killed at Hillsborough 29 years ago is a centerpiece outside the stand.Step outside these expanded environs into the Anfield neighbourhood, where the club itself played a shameful part in the dereliction, buying up houses and leaving them empty for years, and much of the blight has finally been addressed. The terraced rows previously “tinned up” have mostly been refurbished by landlords including the YHG housing association which owns 92 houses. The private developer Keepmoat has built 400 new homes with more planned, some on land where previous terraces, 238 houses in total, were demolished. Liverpool city council was able to lever in £25m from its capital programme – it is suffering existential government cuts to its annual revenue budget – and the Homes and Communities Agency contributed £10m.The Homebaked bakery, a community cooperative, does a thriving trade in Shankly pies and other treats and has advanced plans to develop the empty houses on its row. A new parade of shops and food outlets is planned to replace the tired buildings on Walton Breck Road, where the Hillsborough Justice Campaign shop is based.The club have heeded calls for better relations by setting up the “red neighbours” scheme, providing community activities including a breakfast club for disadvantaged children, school visits and space in the Kenny Dalglish stand to host events. Ann O’Byrne, Liverpool’s deputy mayor and cabinet member for regeneration, recalls the seething anger she found among residents when her local Labour party won a majority on the council in 2010 and pledged to reverse the area’s decline: “We talk about neighbours, and Liverpool Football Club needs to be a good neighbour as well,” she says. “People are still annoyed with the club after what they suffered but the club has stepped up. They have built a relationship tensions are still there but not that pathological hatred of the club.”Yet the contrasts in Anfield and neighbouring Everton are still alarming, between the city’s Premier League institutions and the poverty around them. Liverpool made £364m in revenues last year and a £40m profit, boosted by the first season of main stand corporate subscribers, while Everton at the cramped Goodison Park still made £222m, including a £52m profit on trading players.Jim Lawless, 70, and his daughter Jayne, 43, have lived through the traumas. A civil engineer, Jim bought his fine family home in Everton in 1974 but as houses fell empty and tinned up around them, his wife, Liz, became depressed and they moved, to Tancred Road, a few streets from Anfield’s main stand. “We jumped from one hell hole to the club’s mess, from one fight to another,” he grimaces. “It was pretty catastrophic.”Jim acknowledges there has been “radical improvement” to the area, greatly reducing the blight, since FSG opted to scrap the club’s previous plan to build a new stadium on Stanley Park, got on with the main stand project and the housing regeneration began. Jayne says the wounds remain from so many years of misery, including the £30,000 charge now on the new family home after they were forced to move from Everton.Another sore, which pains them and others, is the loss of the Vernon Sangster sports centre, which was demolished to prepare Stanley Park for Hicks’ and Gillett’s stadium. A high-quality sports facility was promised for the new ground but, as the plans were scrapped, nothing materialised. Jayne recalls “the Verny” as a hub for youngsters when she grew up, remembering roller‑discos, trampolining and summer clubs alongside regular sport.“This is our biggest issue now,” Jim Lawless says. “We’ve got no facilities for the kids. You’ve got billionaires looking over Stanley Park. The club took one facility away. They should build a replacement.”The club and council point to the investment in facilities along the road at the Anfield Sports and Community Centre, formerly a youth club to which the Vernon Sangster operation was relocated. Marie Rooney, the centre’s manager, puts the development at £5.5m, from the council, Sport England, Football Foundation and Liverpool, whose foundation is based there, as is the Hillsborough Family Support Group office. A 2011\u0026nbspcouncil feasibility study concluded that another sports facility in Anfield would not have enough use to be sustainable.But Ian Byrne, a local resident, committee member of the Spirit of Shankly supporters’ trust and co-founder of Fans Supporting Foodbanks, argues there is an urgent need for more community facilities. “It is low expectations to think kids here can’t have more amenities,” he says. “A tiny percentage of the club’s revenues could build something very valuable for the community.”In the absence of a commitment from Liverpool, Byrne and others are exploring the possibilities for a facility on one of the area’s cleared sites, on Priory Road. The council is supportive but does not have the money to build anything itself.Before Tuesday’s European Champions League semi-final Byrne and his fellow volunteers stationed their foodbank van, by agreement with the club, opposite the Anfield Road stand for donations. He is grateful for the club’s support but alarmed at the demand: in Anfield and Everton 1,888 people needed the free food last year, including 755 children.Like many still recovering from a 20-year nightmare, Byrne is grateful for what the club do now and believes they could contribute more.Whatever Liverpool do in this period of their reawakening under a charismatic manager and competent US owners, their stadium will remain unsettling outside, an epitome of Britain’s inequality. Owned by billionaires, fielding multimillionaire players, Anfield is a magnet for corporate customers while, in the car park opposite, fans are asked to donate food for the many people in the locality without enough to eat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45d6f5db979873710d3be7a1d3df4c95ec82db0/421_29_3791_2275/master/3791.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43f871e46c2da4fbd8aa49c93ec2a020","title":"sam allardyce everton","story":"In happier times for Sam Allardyce, back in the days when he was managing Bolton Wanderers and not carrying the same baggage that now weighs him down, he wanted some advice about the best way to deal with the media if, as he confidently assumed, his career in football management was going to continue on its upward trajectory.The man he asked was Alastair Campbell and the trick, according to Labour’s spin doctor, was to see the difficult questions coming in advance, be prepared with a ersion tactic and, if necessary, veer off on a tangent rather than providing a direct answer.Allardyce, by his own admission, taught himself to say anything to “distract and confuse” his audience. “It was good advice,” he wrote in his 2015 autobiography, “and I learned to do it subconsciously, always conveying the message I wanted to deliver, not the one the media were after.” If anyone pointed out the question hadn’t been addressed, he explained, he was already moving on to the next subject. Switch topics, keep talking and don’t get drawn into the nitty-gritty. And, though he didn’t add these words, never be afraid to tell everyone how marvellous you are.On that basis, it isn’t entirely easy to know what to make of his assertion that his talks with Everton’s majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, concluded this past week with an understanding that, contrary to what some fans might want, there was not going to be a change of manager. “We have some clarity moving forward now,” Allardyce said. “We discussed next season and if I wasn’t going to be here why would we be discussing next season at great length?”Allardyce might want to believe that is the case – or, rather, he might want us to believe that is the case – but perhaps it is better to keep an open mind when Everton have high ambitions, with a new sporting director, Marcel Brands, joining in the summer, and there is such a weight of evidence that the manager’s relationship with large sections of the club’s fanbase has broken down.For that, I have seen Everton’s supporters described as ungrateful, unreasonable and unrealistic when Allardyce has, after all, achieved the prime objective of keeping the club above the relegation quagmire. He has done it with something to spare and it can come as a jolt, when Everton seem to have spent the entire season in a state of near‑crisis, to find the team squatting defiantly in eighth after their win at Huddersfield, regardless of the anti-Allardyce banners and mutinous songs.The truth, however, is that he has always been an awkward fit for a club with Everton’s aspirations. As a result, many Evertonians have found it difficult to embrace him from day one. Sometimes in football it just goes that way and it is unusual, in the extreme, that the manager forces a complete rethink. Indeed, the only time I can remember that happening is in the case of Martin O’Neill, going back more than 20 years now to his early days at Leicester City.Leicester’s fans took a long time to recognise O’Neill’s expertise. There were protests and lots of aggro. He won them over but he kept the less complimentary letters in his desk and maybe it was true, as his friends used to say, that the “O” in O’Neill used to stand for obstinate. After Leicester’s promotion, their cup finals and top-10 finishes he would often amuse himself by digging out those letters and, in a couple of cases, ringing up some of the people who had written them.Unfortunately for Allardyce, it is difficult to envisage the same kind of happy ending in his case. He has already lost jobs at West Ham and Newcastle because the fans could not tolerate his style of play and maybe it counts against him in his current job that Liverpool, the club Everton will always measure themselves against, are producing the kind of attacking, adventurous football they have craved at Goodison for longer than they would wish to remember.While Everton have some of the dreariest statistics in the Premier League, Liverpool have scored at least five goals past every opponent on their way to the verge of a Champions League final – 10 over two legs against Maribor, eight against Spartak Moscow, six against Hoffenheim, five versus Sevilla, Porto, Manchester City and, in the first leg of their semi-final, Roma.Everton, on other hand, went into the weekend 19th out of the 20 clubs in the Premier League when it comes to the number of shots they have managed on Allardyce’s watch, 19th in terms of efforts on target, 19th in chances created and 19th for attempted dribbles. Again, Allardyce can point out that the only statistics that should matter are the points that have taken the team into the top half of the table. Plainly, however, it does matter to many Everton followers. The supporters want more. Is that so unreasonable?When Allardyce took the job he talked about an opportunity to show he was more than just a firefighter. That, more than anything, has been the most disappointing part. The football has remained lumpen since it became clear Everton were free of relegation danger. Allardyce has still been the man who substituted an attacker, Yannick Bolasie, with a centre-half, Ramiro Funes Mori, in a 1-1 draw at a Swansea side five places off the bottom. He has abandoned Davy Klaassen when surely these would be opportune moments to experiment with a £23m player. And when it comes to spinning the truth, how about his assertion that Everton were below West Brom before he took over?That would be true if Allardyce wants to claim Everton’s 4-0 defeat of West Ham on 29 November as his own work. But it wasn’t. It was David Unsworth’s final match as caretaker manager – Allardyce watched from the directors’ box – and the win meant Everton moved up from 17th position to 13th. Allardyce, to give him his due, has moved Everton another five places up the table but he should know enough about the business to understand he cannot take anything for granted this summer, no matter what he might say in public.José Mourinho could hardly have been more emphatic when he set about trying to nail the “lie” that he had given up on Mohamed Salah too early when they were manager and player at Chelsea.Mourinho pointed out that he, in fact, had been the manager who identified Salah as a potential Premier League star. Salah then left Chelsea to go on loan to Fiorentina and the rest, according to Mourinho, was nothing to do with him. “Chelsea decided to sell him, OK? And when they say that I was the one that sold him it is a lie.”Fair enough and Mourinho, complaining about “another injustice talked about me”, always sounds like he believes every word. Except, of course, he does have a habit of rewriting history. Does he remember an interview with Sky Sports in 2015 when he was asked about the same player? “I see his future elsewhere,” Mourinho said on that occasion. “Either on loan, or sold with an offer, we are happy to accept. We have five wingers and it is better not to have Salah\u0026nbspback.”Forgive me, Arsenal fans, for feeling a flicker of schadenfreude about Antoine Griezmann’s goal for Atlético Madrid the other night, but did anybody else note that the Spaniards won possession to set up the decisive move from one of those moments when Danny Welbeck appeared to be thrown off balance by the powers of thin air?It isn’t a surprise any longer when players e in the hope of winning a cheap free-kick (or penalty), but the repeat offenders might have to understand there is zero sympathy when the biter gets\u0026nbspbit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/069f33c9afeb67d7c5995f5146e2e877a2cb2c58/325_108_3368_2021/master/3368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d9a3312968fda7e59db3fe8bda0d846","title":"west ham v manchester city premier league live","story":"And in more Other Football News, Celtic are beating Rangers 5 (FIVE) -0 and there are still almost 20 minutes left.

It’s a home game after all. But it’s a home game against Manchester City, who didn’t appear to be on the beach when beating Swansea last week and might just see their champion status as an excuse to cut even looser and flow even more freely. If there’s some encouragement to be taken by Moyes it’s the excellent, dogged performance West Ham put up at the Etihad early on in his tenure, even if they were eventually beaten, and perhaps something from a similar playbook would work today – because even a point would make their task a fair bit easier at this stage.Can they achieve it?

Neither is there the chance to cover the pastry with parchment and baking beans to keep it from shrinking as it bakes or to rescue runaway baking beans from the floor where a few inevitably end up as you lift them out. But sometimes, you just want a slice of tart.Of course, there are occasions when there simply has to be a pastry case. To hold a soothing balm of lemon curd for instance, or secure the raspberry jam and almond cream layers of a Bakewell pudding. (Blackcurrant jam is much better by the way.) You need deep, biscuit-crisp edges, too, for a treacle tart or a lemon meringue or for a nutmeg-freckled custard tart.Mostly, I need only a crisp and crumbly base on which to pile a layer of cream or cream cheese and another of seasonal fruit. Which is exactly what I did this week, folding flaked almonds, poppy seeds and pine nuts into a shortbread dough on which we placed ricotta cream and slices of Italian oranges, the fruit’s glowing flesh blushed with scarlet. As a glaze, I used a fragrant syrup of warm honey and thyme.I also put together a batch of pancakes this week.

Finely grate the zest from the lemon then fold, together with the seeds and nuts, into the shortbread dough.Bring the mixture together with floured hands, put on a parchment-lined baking sheet, then lightly pat into a rectangle roughly 22 x 24 cm.

We have been together for 15 months and he is exactly what you would want in a partner – loving, kind, accepting and ultimately makes himself totally available to me in all senses of the word. This is also exactly the opposite of any kind of man I have dated previously and I worry that those experiences have somehow scarred me. I find myself wishing he was more unavailable, less overtly loving and did not dote on me so much.I feel I am attracted more to men I know to be bad news, particularly if they’re off limits, and I wish there was more passion in our relationship. None of this is helped by my having health problems recently. We have discussed moving in together and a big trip, but I find myself torn between this path and a very different partner and life.I can’t tell if I am pursuing the idea of perfection, or if these are genuine issues that will leave me feeling dissatisfied and unhappy later down the line.Mariella replies I’m so glad you wrote. It takes most of us so much longer to realise we’re making bad choices – three decades in the case of yours truly – so well done for spotting your romantic peccadillos so soon! Not that such self-awareness automatically gifts you with a crystal ball for future pairing. Taking that for granted would be tantamount to believing that we live in a fair and equal world and we all know that’s not the case. Any relationship is a gamble and while that can get us into all sorts of trouble along the way it’s also part of the fun.The pursuit of perfection may be a compelling pastime that occasionally achieves tangible results, but in most cases it proves an everlasting and insatiable quest. You may well be in a relationship that’s ill-suited to your emotional requirements or you may just be overthinking things. As this is your first serious coupling it’s unlikely to be your last, which may sound harsh but that certainly takes the heat off and offers you a lot more exploratory freedom than you might feel at, say, 40.You describe your previous preference for men who behave badly, but your choice of a “serious” boyfriend is the opposite of that description. Why so? Did self-preservation come into play or does the guy you’ve ended up with have more appealing qualities than you are giving him credit for? Nobody wants to while away their lives with a dullard, so I’m always cautious about those who are committed to “protecting”, “taking care of”, or worse still “worshipping” their lover.A desperation to nurture you is as unwelcome an aspiration as serial adultery. All the best relationships I’ve witnessed have been those where partners don’t lose a sense of their own priorities. Therefore, when you say he “ultimately makes himself available to me in all senses of the word,” I get nervous. The answer seems to be to sample the experience for as long as you enjoy it and stop worrying about whether he’s the perfect proposition for the long haul. I can see you are tying yourself in knots trying to make the right choice, but what if there’s no such thing?My advice would be to stop chewing over the long-term considerations and just accept this relationship in the here and now. Taking an extended trip seems an excellent way of establishing whether there is a possibility for anything longer term. If he doesn’t drive you crazy when you’re in constant close proximity, you’ll know that you stand a chance of cohabiting successfully. Nothing is laid in stone, life is an endless array of changes and choices and I suspect by conscientiously trying to do the best thing you’re limiting your experiences. Predicting the future is a fool’s game and yet it ties up so much of our emotional energy.When you get to my age and start attending more funerals than weddings it’s a topic you can’t help but dwell on. What was time well spent? What was squandered? All too often it’s the energy expended on fretting and speculating about what might happen rather than living each day as the welcome surprise it is that seems worth regretting. It also seems time we all embraced a more realistic and contemporary approach to our pairings. Once upon a time the choice of who to settle down with was a serious business, particularly for women. When you’d made your choice, or had it made for you more often than not, there you were, stuck, until death did you part. Nowadays we can hook up and pair off, change our minds, stream through a whole regiment or decide our best friend was the person we wanted all along. Freedom brings with it an escalation of personal choice and that doesn’t make decision-making easier.Being attracted to bad boys and hitching your wagon to one for life are very different things but you mustn’t live in fear of making mistakes. Worrying about the future is seriously detrimental to enjoying the present and I’m increasingly convinced that’s all we can be sure of. So enjoy the relationship for what it offers, or move on to more adrenaline-fuelled adventures – both routes have something to offer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6134464a451d624a47f402dd97a52c4b5bf50a9d/0_400_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f188c7ec5eb24e07ea4241505121505","title":"recycle waste printer council environment","story":"We have been running around like headless chickens to find an environmentally responsible way to gift or dispose of two inkjet printers. None of the charitable organisations or companies we contacted is able to help. Our local Space Waye recycling centre (London Borough of Hounslow) will not allow pedestrians to use the facility – you can only drive in, not drop anything off. We do not own a car. The council will not take printers in the recycling collections, as they restrict this to electronicelectrical items that fit into a normal supermarket carrier bag. We now understand why so many people just fly-tip computers and printers. What do we do?While recycling inkjet cartridges is common – and can even get you discounts on new ones – recycling unwanted printers is less common, even though they have much recyclable content.Craig Stephens, campaign manager with Recycle Now, says: “It’s worth checking the recycling locator on recyclenow to find local recycling points for particular items. Alternatively, try contacting the local authority directly it may be that they will accommodate a printer, given notice, or on the basis that it is, perhaps, just a little bit bigger than the usual electricals collection.”The London-based Restart Project, set up to encourage people to reduce waste, tells us: “Some charity shops, for example Fara, in the greater London area, do accept donations for most electrical and electronics for reuse.” You can always give away stuff on reuse networks like Freecycle, Freegle and Streetbank. Sometimes local Facebook groups can serve this purpose, too. And stores such as PC World and Currys take any unwanted electricals for recycling, irrespective of where they had been bought.Hounslow council says it is one of only a handful London boroughs offering a doorstep small electricals recycling service but adds: “Regrettably, due to the size of CP’s printers they cannot be collected as part of this service.” It points to our suggestions, as above, but also adds: “CP might want to contact community centres or schools to see if they would like to be gifted these items.”We welcome letters but cannot answer inidually.

This all-encompassing scrutiny is clear from the get-go of his sold-out show, with an introductory video in which he criticises western television for its propagation of negative images of black people over the course of history. Backed by his DJ and a live drummer, Akala carries the air of a civil rights orator. His energetic presentation and lyrically dense raps float with poise, are ingested by his cult following and reflected back in the form of constant mobbing.Particular fervour is whipped up as he moves through call-to-arms thriller Sun Tzu, with the help of featured guest Asheber, and the crowd’s growing appreciation for his tongue-twisting prowess crafts a raucous atmosphere. Each of the night’s peaks, from singalong anthems Roll Wid Us and XXL to curtain call Find No Enemy, are constantly topped, and these leaps do not falter as the show continues. It’s as if he finds infinite strength in rejecting gang violence, examining historical injustice towards black people, and exploring the doctrines of black leaders such as Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey. His calm demeanour is a tonic to the lyrical onslaughts, and comforting, given the tough nature of his subject matter.Akala’s mission to educate becomes increasingly obvious, and comic-book style visuals and impromptu on-stage soliloquies inject vividness into his songs about finding one’s path after being led astray. There is a genuine feeling that he is trying to make sense of the world’s injustices as he speaks, which numbs the crowd into a thought-provoking silence. He saves the night’s most powerful sequence for Visions, a detailed account of black history, from pre-civilisation to the present day, that bounces off the exceptional pounding drums that soundtrack the entire evening. He draws a line in the sand between himself and his braggadocio rap contemporaries, with anecdotes relating to discovering his own limitations, and urges the crowd to do the same. His fervent hand-waving is proof that his belief in his own work continues to burn like an Olympic flame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16603970b80c30b2f4e96436f601df35b101f08c/2387_172_6068_3641/master/6068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a8dd5196f3548653a2ebb24424de662","title":"gary barlow review blackpool opera house take that","story":"Blackpool Opera HouseThere’s an almost music-hall atmosphere as this gig from the singer’s smaller-stage tour delivers a crowd-pleasing portfolio of Take That hits among solo numbers Where Take That’s stadium and arena tours have become visual extravaganzas, featuring mechanical elephants and giant robots, the band’s singer-songwriter’s theatre tour takes him back, if not for good, to intimate gigs heavy on traditional stagecraft and audience interaction. “Gary! Gary!” the mostly female audience (some wearing Barlow masks) chant before he bounds on, all peroxide quiff, big grins and black and red suit, which renders him a cross between a totalitarian dictator and Star Trek’s Captain Kirk. “Turn the lights up and let’s ’ave a look at this audience,” he yells. “Oh yes! Saturday in Blackpool!” Although Barlow’s reissued 1997 debut, Open Road, recently went Top 10, solo songs don’t feature prominently in the setlist. In the show opener Since I Last Saw You, however, he reconciles himself to being popular but uncool (“I’ve made my peace with what may happen  Accepted I won’t be in fashion”). This means he can cheerily interrupt songs with Alan Partidge-isms (“Whoo! Nice!” “Did you enjoy that? Yes!”) and trigger a massive singsong with a ticker-tape explosion as early as the second number. It’s a bit of a stretch to call Barlow a renaissance man, but the singerretired X Factor judge and occasional Heartbeat actor has built up a more varied portfolio than most performers who served their apprenticeship in northern working men’s clubs. Here, he delves into songs from his musicals, Finding Neverland and Calendar Girls, unveils a curious sideline as tour statistician (“and this song was released on the 11th October 1993”), tactfully avoids his brief but controversial 2014 period as a poster boy for tax avoidance and settles into a comfier role as all-round end-of-the-pier light entertainer. When someone in the crowd holds up a sign reading: “Mummy and me came from Malta. Can I have a hug?” he strides into the stalls to give them one. Someone else with a placard reading: “I’ll never forget sitting on your organ,” is theatrically scolded: “That’s disgusting!” He serenades an audience member called Martina with A Million Love Songs while she sits at the end of his piano and films it on her phone. There’s a dollop of pantomime as he removes his jacket: people start cheering “Stop it!” and bombard him with mock boos when he puts more clothing on. Otherwise, he knows that people want plenty of Take That nostalgia and doesn’t let them down. New song Relive Those Years tells the band’s story from early days to 2005 reformation with jazz, confessionals and witty self-deprecation. “My appetite for singing slowly dies,” he sings of his post-split wilderness period, rubbing his now trimmer stomach for the punchline, “replaced by an appetite for pies”. Meanwhile, TT smashes are gleefully reinvented – as big-band brass (Everything Changes), cod jazz funk (Sure), seaside disco stomper (Dan Hartman cover Relight My Fire) – or accompanied by comically bad dancing (Pray). Although he turns in a shift as sincere balladeer, this show is less about gravitas than 90 minutes of old-fashioned, almost music-hall showbiz. Still, it’s hard not to be swept along as a crowd choir turn Back for Good, Patience, Never Forget and the rest into Last-Night-of-the-Proms-type epics. Barlow reminds the audience that party towns and theatres like this are where he started and, in a sense, he has never left. “Goodnight,” he promises. “I’ll see you on the ghost train.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/224784826858992f79ee628ffdad6d351b6b84d8/0_343_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=894dfd1ebe5da9c92f619bd08d431d7e","title":"support for cross party plans take no deal brexit off table","story":"Theresa May is facing another major rebellion over Brexit amid a cross-party move to kill off any attempt to crash out of the EU without a deal.A group of MPs and peers has been carefully crafting new laws that will hand parliament guaranteed powers to soften any deal and send the government back to the negotiating table.Tory sources already think there is enough support in the Commons for the plan, which they believe would end the threat of a “no deal” outcome. The move is being described by senior figures as one of the most significant amendments of the Brexit process.Ministers have previously warned that should the deal negotiated with the EU be voted down by parliament, Britain could simply leave the bloc with no agreement. However, the cross-party group’s proposal ensures that if the agreement were voted down, parliament could alter it and ask the government to reopen EU talks.The measure is expected to win a three-figure majority in the Lords on Monday and Tory Remainers are confident it will not be overturned in the Commons next month. The government is already being urged simply to accept the measure.It could open the way for parliament to back staying in the EU’s customs union and single market –something currently ruled out by the prime minister.It comes with rebel Tory MPs beginning to believe that there could now be a Commons majority for staying in the customs union and its single market, through membership of the European Free Trade Association.One well-placed Tory said there were “a few in cabinet who now see it as a possible solution”. However, the cabinet’s Brexiters are preparing a big push this week against any suggestion Britain should remain inside the customs union, which would make it impossible for the UK to negotiate its own trade deals.While Brexit minister David Davis indicated last week that parliament would have a real “meaningful vote” over the Brexit deal on offer, both peers and Remain MPs want to enshrine the guarantees in law. Labour regards the proposal as extremely significant because it would allow its MPs and Tory rebels to vote against the agreement on offer without the fear of triggering a disastrous “no deal” outcome. Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, told the Observer: “This is one of the most important amendments of the entire Brexit process – and indeed of the parliament. We have always been clear that the vote must be truly meaningful. It cannot simply be a take-it-or-leave-it choice as the prime minister has suggested.“This amendment, which has cross-party support, would provide a safety net in the Brexit process. It would remove the possibility of a No vote leading to a no-deal. It would bring back control to parliament.”The measure is being presented in the Lords by a group of peers led by former Tory minister Lord Hailsham.However, the government describes the measure as a meaningless attempt to frustrate Brexit.Lord Callanan, the Brexit minister in the Lords, said: “Labour’s flawed amendment seeks to tie our hands by inserting false deadlines and shifting the power to negotiate from government to parliament. It asks for meaningless votes on the deal before the deal is done. Those who want to overturn the referendum call this the ‘no Brexit’ amendment.“The Conservatives are taking the scrutinising role of parliament seriously, to improve an essential piece of legislation. Labour are using it to frustrate Brexit.”Senior Labour MPs, meanwhile, are directly appealing to their counterparts in the Lords to back attempts to keep Britain in the customs union and single market. Chuka Umunna, Heidi Alexander, Alison McGovern and Chris Leslie have written to Labour peers urging for their help.“We are writing to ask for your support for an amendment which requires the government to make the UK’s continued participation in the European Economic Area (EEA) an objective in the Brexit negotiations,” they write. “The EEA provides a platform on which we can continue to be part of the EU single market if Brexit occurs, with the protection for workers, consumers and our environment that our party believes in.”Another Labour MP, meanwhile, is attempting to engineer the first Commons vote on whether or not the final Brexit deal should be put to a second referendum. Gareth Thomas, the former trade minister, will introduce a backbench bill next month, which will trigger a non-binding vote on the issue.“A people’s vote would give the British people the chance to take back control over Brexit from a small cabal of Leave ideologues and instead, on the biggest question facing our country, determine together our country’s economic, social and cultural future,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/178984a25ada8e2cd4243639899dbd13a8bc5f70/248_280_1186_711/master/1186.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=613763ed07d1e67a7de2f83f7a433257","title":"davis under pressure to disown criticism of civil service chief on brexit","story":"Minister reported to have told PM he would resign if she did not sideline Whitehall mandarinDavid Davis is facing demands from the senior civil servants’ union to disown claims that he has threatened to resign unless Theresa May sidelines Whitehall’s most senior Brexit mandarin.It follows reports in the Sunday Times claiming that the Brexit secretary had told the prime minister he would step down unless the No 10 adviser Oliver Robbins was ignored in favour of ministers.May faces a tense Brexit inner cabinet meeting on Wednesday, when she is expected to put forward a plan, backed by Robbins, to create a customs partnership with the EU. EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.Attacks upon Robbins in the media have provoked a furious response from civil servants. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, said: “Is there a more despicable form of political cowardice than to allow anonymous briefings in your name to effectively call for a civil servant to be sacked?“Civil servants advise, ministers decide. Politicians of all stripes know this. If David Davis leaves these comments from a ‘close ally’ out there unchallenged, it ultimately suggests that he supports them but isn’t brave enough to say so publicly”.Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, also took the unusual step of tweeting about criticisms of Robbins. After May’s close aide Gavin Barwell retweeted a statement from the chief whip, Julian Smith, saying “Attacking ind civil servants is deeply unfair”, Heywood wrote:Under Robbins’ plan, the UK would collect import tariffs on behalf of Brussels, while being free to set its own duties for goods bound for the UK. Pro-Brexit Conservatives have described the plan as unworkable and say it will allow Brussels to dictate UK trade policy.According to the Sunday Times, Davis has told the prime minister to ignore Robbins in favour of her ministers.  Robbins, tipped as a future cabinet secretary, was moved from Davis’s Brexit department into No 10 last year as May sought to take greater control over the process.A former minister told the Sunday Times that Tory backbenchers could be willing to oust May if she does not stop listening to her adviser on the customs partnership plan.“The prime minister would be extraordinarily unwise to take Robbins’ advice on this,” they told the paper. “There will be a very swift and very violent reaction. It will put the prime minister in personal peril.”The Brexiter business group Leave Means Leave has called for Robbins to be sacked and “replaced by someone from outside the civil service who will take a tough line with Brussels”.Richard Tice and John Longworth of the Brexit-backing business group wrote: “At each stage, Robbins has presided over a bungled negotiating position on behalf of the UK, giving leverage to the EU and acquiescing to their every whim in a way no business person would do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80186cedc46eb336d5cd13eeb6c52d496e2326b0/0_68_2512_1507/master/2512.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb31ace60e3ba3528c0621e253cd8e8c","title":"ronnie osullivan knocked out bitter clash ali carter world championship","story":"Ronnie O’Sullivan clashed with Ali Carter at the Crucible as the five-times winner crashed out of the World Championship.O’Sullivan, the title favourite, snapped at Carter in the 19th frame of the second-round match, describing the 38-year-old as “Mr Angry” after also appearing to barge him.Carter went on to clinch a 13-9 victory, his first win over O’Sullivan in a major tournament after years of trying. O’Sullivan beat Carter in two world championship finals, in 2008 and 2012.O’Sullivan had just fluked a snooker when he and Carter collided at the side of the table in a flash point that defined the match.Once back in his seat, O’Sullivan said: “That’s for being Mr Angry.” He then told Carter it was his turn\u0026nbspto play, sparking Carter to respond: “Thank you very much, very nice of you.”The referee, Paul Collier, intervened and said: “Right, fellas, just play on,” with O’Sullivan then saying he was “cool as a cucumber”.Carter, who has twice overcome cancer and suffers from Crohn’s disease, said of the incident: “I just thought, ‘Listen, I’m not intimidated by Ronnie like a lot of other players are. I’ve been through harder things than that in my life.’”He added: “It would have been easy for me to sit back in my chair and be like, ‘I’d better be the little boy in the corner’.“But no, it was my day today and I’m delighted.”O’Sullivan was asked whether he would apologise to Carter. “I don’t think there’s anything to apologise about. There’s no hard feeling there,” the 42-year-old said.O’Sullivan claimed Carter also barged him during the match. Asked if he thought he might be fined by disciplinary chiefs, O’Sullivan added: “I don’t really know. They can send a letter to my lawyer and they can happily deal with it.“Have you never been angry in your life? We all get angry sometimes. If someone’s going to shoulder-barge into me, do I have to walk around him, tiptoe or do a little curtsy as if he’s the Queen? Sometimes you have to stand your ground. I’m not a limbo dancer, you know.”O’Sullivan trailed 11-9 at the mid-session interval but he had been off his game for most of the match and it was no surprise that he inched no closer.

It also means that it won’t be the same for everyone, as some areas of the course are protected by windbreaks. The formation lap is away, and the general preference is for the supersoft tyre. Kimi Raikkonen is on ultrasoft, though, so is one to watch off the line. Right then, here we are!

And Sussex now 80 for 4.The Lancies decide to swing the bat, and Bailey is out c Dunn b Virdi 66. Lancashire declare, DECLARE DO YOU HEAR, on 439 for 9. Four wickets for Virdi, Mennie 68 not out. Well, well.And so John Crossland and Alex Watson’s 136 year ninth-wicket record slides quietly off the slipway to be replaced by Mennie and Bailey’s 100 partnership off 124 balls. They now hold the record for the ninth-wicket for either side in Surrey v Lancs games. My head hurts.A fourth wicket for Hogan at Lord’s, Stirling for 1, with Middlesex now 106-5 - but Eskinazi batting well for 65. At New Road Joe Clarke leads the counter-attack 34 not out - 6 fours!Meanwhile things progress serenely along at Old Trafford: fifty for Joe Mennie, from 90 balls, his second consecutive half-century. And now Tom Bailey too: 52 including 8 fours. Lancs 4088. If they get to 418 they will break the ninth wicket partnership record against Surrey, set in 1882....What-ho! 24 for 4 at Taunton. Hildreth b Brooks for 10 Bartlett c Hodd b Coad 4. Coad 2-18, Brooks 2-6.As a wicket goes down at Lord’s - Cartwright b Hogan 5 - and bad light stops play at Hove, even with the floodlights on, some common sense and super geekery from VIC:“Good morning Tanya, good morning everyone from a chilly, dry Taunton. Already a wicket has fallen. Marcus Trescothick has been caught at second slip off Ben Coad, Matt Renshaw has walloped one ball over mid-wicket off Brooks and looks as if he is intending to play his shots again.Yesterday I got in touch with Andrew Samson about Renshaw’s six hitting, one off the mark, another to reach 50, another for his 100. In the box this morning we have Steve James, who confirmed, without the need for too much deliberation, that he never did this. As ever Samson does not disappoint. He says Shingirai Masakadza did it in a Logan Cup match for Mountaineers v Mashonaland Eagles in Harare last November on his way to 142 from 90 balls with 13 sixes. Not many people know that (until now).Perhaps more relevantly Renshaw has just been bowled by a swinger from Brooks. 11-2. Feels like this could finish today.”Yikes - Renshaw is out at Taunton b Brooks for 8.Another down at New Road - a wicket an over at the moment - they’ll be lunching early. Not a happy first home game so far. D’Oliveria c Taylor b Ball 3. Worcestershire 33.And in a totally different world: a placid fifty partnership comes up at Old Trafford between Mennie and Bailey.For anyone contemplating rolling up to Grace Road- there will be a further inspection at midday.Ah, and another at New Road. A wicket for Broad: Fell lbw for 0. Worcestershire 3 for 2 - another one of those days?Things are looking up - we have play at Lord’s, New Road, Old Trafford, Hove, The Ageas Bowl and Taunton. At New Road, the long wait is over only for Worcestershire to lose a wicket to the fifth ball of the innings. Mitchell b Ball 0. Broad is now starting his first spell of the season. And a wicket at Taunton:Trescothick has fallen to Coad for twoGood morning from Old Trafford where a chilly breeze is whistling merrily but the sun is set fair. The prospects of play round the country are mixed.Play has been abandoned for the day at Wantage Road - not a ball bowled there yet. They’re hoping to play at New Road, the blowers are out and fingers are crossed for an 11am start. It has stopped raining at Grace Road but there will be a delayed start. They’re hopeful at the moment of starting at 11am at Lord’sPlay will start on time at Hove, Old Trafford, The Ageas Bowl, and Taunton.Plenty to see yesterday, particularly Renshaw’s pyrotechnics at Taunton followed by wickets galore there and at Hove. Then Lancashire’s steadfast recovery from 23 for 3, a cracking late-evening 78 from Jordan Clark and superb fielding from Surrey. And today? Maybe Alastair Cook and Stuart Broad at last...And finally, as I walked out of the ground at 8 o’clock last night, there in the nets was Haseeb Hameed. Crack, crack, crack, crack. That, combined with the news that Simon Kerrigan is going to concentrate on coaching rather than playing, illustrates the precariousness and the heartache that comes with being a professional cricketer. Good luck to all, today.Tanya will be here shortly.

To a packed house, and under the watchful eye of the outgoing Apple Music executive (and Patti Smith producer) Jimmy Iovine, Smith’s performance – joined by Bruce Springsteen for two numbers – appeared as a foretelling of Apple’s remedial strategy and future direction.The world’s most valuable public company releases its latest results on Tuesday and has no doubt, once again, sold billions of dollars worth of iPhones. But as the iPhone ages, it’s increasingly clear that Apple is looking for new sources of revenue, and Smith is part of that effort.Big tech is moving into content production and distribution. For three years, the company has been hiring from the design and luxury industries – including top executives like Paul Deneve, the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, and Angela Ahrendts, the former CEO of Burberry.It hired or consulted with Iovine, Dr Dre and Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor after Apple acquired Beats By Dre in a $1bn acquisition and briefly repurposed them for the launch of Apple Music, which has now gained 36 million subscribers and is poised to overtake its music streaming rival Spotify in the US.Rumors have even circulated that Apple is looking to buy parts or all of the troubled magazine publisher Condé Nast, a move that would further its push, initiated with the Apple Watch, to become a luxury fashion accessory, lifestyle and content brand.Can Apple buy its way out of trouble? On the surface that seems a ridiculous question for a company that made $61bn last year and is expected to have sold 54m iPhones in the last three months. But no matter its size, Apple still faces a big test on Tuesday. As the tech giant releases its first-quarter numbers, analysts worry they could expose further weakness in consumer demand for the company’s top-line products. Based on reports from Apple’s Asian supply chain partners, the company could be about to lower production targets for its iPhone X, the $1,000 model that has failed to meet sales expectations. In mid-March, Apple stock peaked at $182 its stock price fell to about $162 last week, dropping over five straight Wall Street trading sessions.“The street has gone into ‘full panic mode’,” the GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said in a client report. Ives said that bad news from Asian suppliers correlated with “softer demand and $1,000 sticker-shock price points on iPhone X”. The big question, he added, was what demand for Apple’s iPhone range would look like after the company launched its 12th-generation model in September. Patti Smith is a small part of Apple’s plan B. Gene Munster, a longtime Apple watcher and Loup Ventures analyst, estimates the company will ramp up its spending on original content in video, music and publishing to $4.2bn by 2022 from $1bn this year and $500m in 2017.“Historically, Apple has been a platform for distributing content but increasingly they want to create their own content and that changes their whole profile,” said Munster. Apple, he reasons, is in a similar position to Amazon in that it doesn’t want to make a ton of money from content but views it as a means to growth.“We think that content is always king and the tech companies are starting to understand how king content can drive their businesses. In Apple’s case that’s selling iPhones, in Google’s case it’s advertising, and in Amazon’s that’s selling Amazon Prime memberships.”The Condé Nast rumors may stem from Apple’s acquisition last month of Texture, a digital magazine subscription service part-owned by Condé Nast. Senior Apple executives said they were “committed to quality journalism”.Analysts think an acquisition unlikely. “It’s a well-traveled road of rumors of Apple buying content companies, typically a studio,” said Munster. Sadly for Condé, and others, people are less interested in paying for written content than video and music, he said. “It’s within the scheme of them paying for more content, but I think Apple has their sights set on video and music more than the written word.”Apple’s increased spending on content still leaves it short of the subscription darling Netflix ($6.8bn), or the surging Amazon, which is expected to increase its spending on original content from $4.5bn to $8.3bn.“Over the next five years, we think there’s going to be one single offering for video, music and print content. These essentially vertical subscriptions are focused on one type of content – music, video (Netflix or HBO) or print. So the concept is to create all-in-one offerings for different types of media,” said Munster.Apple’s acquisition of Condé Nast, whose US operation is believed to be losing $100m a year while its foreign operation is marginally profitable on similar revenues of around $1bn, would doubtless be a headline-grabbing move.But while media is a growing business for Apple, and it is reported to want to acquire and produce as many as 10 television shows, it has yet to register an original video content hit. Apple’s Planet of the Apps, a reality show about app developers, and Carpool Karaoke, a spin-off of James Corden’s hit late night segment that features celebrities singing in a car together, have not gained traction with audiences. Apple also purchased the rights for a TV project from Damien Chazelle, the Oscar-winning writer and director of La La Land, and a Reese Witherspoon-produced comedy show. “While the reviews have so far been dismal, they have launched their own original content,” said Munster.In music, too, Apple has missed a beat. Its success with Apple Music comes after five years of struggle that led it to rebrand Beats Music as Apple Music and follow Spotify and others as consumers showed more willingness to pay for music on a subscription basis than by the track.A future in which Apple offers video, music and publishing content at $15 a month is probable, Munster says. Like Amazon – or Netflix – Apple sees rich sources of future revenue from subscriptions to content in the cloud.At the Beacon on Monday, Apple learned – as it did when it automatically inserted a free U2 album into customers’ iTunes libraries – that not everyone is grateful for its sponsorship.When Smith thanked Apple during her performance, her gratitude was met with boos. The singer deftly sidestepped the issue, retorting that maybe one of the hecklers needed the bathroom. “I normally just piss in a can or dig a hole,” she added before launching into her Radio Ethiopia track “Pissing in a River”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81d98505a16e683fcac471844753e4979a680334/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59dfaf84a5eabc970998e0700a6a56bd","title":"stationery that looks good enough to eat in pictures","story":"When he turned seven, Neal Whittington’s uncle gave him a £7 WH Smith voucher: this started a lifelong obsession with stationery.

Its usage is also becoming annoyingly ubiquitous and I call on my fellow headline writers to desist forthwith.While I’m on the subject of headlines, there has been an equally unwelcome new visitor of late, as the following recent examples make all too plain: “San Leon energy shares resume trading after exiting reverse takeover talks” “Can Emmanuel Macron keep Trump from exiting the Iran nuclear deal?” “Are Samsung exiting the business communications market?” and “How Affleck exiting the Batman director’s chair led to the Deathstroke movie”. What is wrong with the word “leaving”? Do people somehow imagine that exiting is more dynamic or is it yet another baleful byproduct of Brexit? Well, consider that David Davis has been saddled with the quite revolting title of secretary of state for exiting the European Union and you’ll get my drift.Having got these recent annoyances off my chest, I’d like to return to an age-old grievance, namely using nouns as verbs and perhaps the most egregious one yet.A colleague was watching Bloomberg News when the announcer proclaimed that Facebook had been “townhalling”.

He finished fifth. He’s the new co-host of spin-off show Bake Off: The Professionals and his debut cookbook will be published this summer. He also studies drama and theatre arts at Goldsmiths University, London.How did you get the job on Bake Off: The Professionals?It was mad. The Bake Off people asked if I wanted to try out and I did a couple of screen tests and before I knew it, I’d got the gig. I’m a drama student, so I’ve always wanted to do something along these lines.What’s it like being on the other side of the workbench?The first few days felt odd. I know what the contestants are going through – especially when people are trying to chat when you just want to crack on with baking – but as the weeks went by, it became easier. Everyone’s trying to do their job, so you have to be chill but efficient at the same time.Your co-presenter is the comedian Tom Allen. How’s that working out?I met Tom at the screen test and we really hit it off, so it was wicked we got the gig together. We’re like two schoolkids, gossiping and giggling at the back of the class.How high is the standard of contestants?They’re pro pastry chefs, so at first I was like, “How the hell did you make that in four hours?” Some of their creations are insane. I’m learning loads.What do Bake Off fans tend to remember you for?My flavours and one-liners. In week four, when the technical round was stroopwafels, I just shrugged to the camera and went “Waffles innit?” People still say that to me. And “decent”.You got a Paul Hollywood handshake for your millionaire’s shortbread…That was a moment. I’d been watching Bake Off for four years and the handshake had become a big deal, so I was buzzing all week when I got my own. He doesn’t crush your hand but it’s definitely a firm shake. You know that Paul kneads bread for a living.Where do you keep your Bake Off apron?In my room. It still has stains on it and each stain tells a story. I look at it every now and again and think “Yeah man, I did that. That was pretty cool.”Does the obesity crisis mean we shouldn’t be so cake-obsessed?It’s a question of balance – finding the correct blend between a healthy lifestyle and indulging when you see fit. Don’t deprive yourself, just do everything in moderation. My book, which comes out in July, is called Cheeky Treats. That’s what it’s about: live healthily, but treat yourself sometimes and don’t look back.With all the cakes you eat and sample, do you find yourself putting on weight?Not really, fortunately. I’ll always love cake. And bacon. Otherwise, I try to eat as well as possible and exercise daily. People are always getting me to taste stuff, or messaging me for baking advice. I try my hardest to reply, because a year ago I was that guy. If I can help someone out now, I always will.What do you do when you’re not studying, presenting or baking? Watch Man United, of course. The UK rap scene is a massive thing for me, too. Film-wise, I’m a humongous Marvel fan, so I’m stoked to see Avengers: Infinity War. I’m digging Mexican food at the moment and I love Nando’s so much. When I was in sixth form, Nando’s was basically my house – my loyalty card had 40 chillies on it.Your parting words from Bake Off were “It’s not the end of me, it’s the beginning.

His book is a harrowing masterpieceIf you think there is no reason for another book about a grave miscarriage of American justice, think again.Anthony Ray Hinton’s memoir of his wrongful imprisonment for 30 years for three murders he did not commit is a riveting account of the multiple outrages of the criminal justice system of Alabama. But that isn’t what makes this a genuine spiritual experience: that comes from the nearly biblical capacity of the author to endure, to forgive, and finally to triumph. It only takes the first two pages of the introduction by the author’s equally remarkable lawyer, Bryan Stevenson, to make the reader appalled. There was no evidence at all to tie Hinton to two of the three murders he was accused of, and he was “locked in a supermarket warehouse cleaning floors … when a restaurant manager 15 miles away was abducted, robbed and shot”.That victim survived and then misidentified Hinton as his assailant then the state completed this travesty by providing completely fake ballistic evidence to tie a gun found in Hinton’s mother’s home to all three murders.“My only crime was being born black in Alabama,” Hinton writes, his prosecution “nothing less than a lynching” in which the white robes of the Ku Klux Klan were replaced by the black robes of justice. One of his arresting officers explained his fate this way, after the prisoner told him he could prove he had been working at the time of one of the murders: “You know, I don’t even care whether you did or didn’t do it … In fact, I believe you didn’t do it. But it doesn’t matter. If you didn’t do it, one of your brothers did. And you’re going to take the rap. You want to know why?”“Number one, you’re black. Number two, a white man gonna say you shot him. Number three, you’re gonna have a white district attorney. Number four, you’re gonna have a white judge. And number five, you’re gonna have an all-white jury.”The cop was right. Hinton was assigned an incompetent lawyer who was paid $1,000 by the state and then proceeded to hire an incompetent ballistics expert who guaranteed his conviction on fake evidence. “In Alabama,” he writes, “judges are elected based on how many people they send to death row, not on how many people they let off.” Hinton’s lawyer provides this ghastly statistic: “With 34 executions and seven exonerations in Alabama since 1975, one innocent person has been identified on Alabama’s death row for every five executions.” With the help of his co-author Lara Love Hardin, Hinton conveys all the horror of his years in solitary confinement, barely able to breath in 120F (49C) summer heat, eating food that tasted like dust. But something deep inside his character made it possible for him to make friends of everyone near him, from the white man next to him on death row who had lynched a black teenager to almost every single prison guard who met him. His lawyer writes: “Never have more guards, correctional staff and prison workers pulled me aside to offer assistance … during the many years I have worked with Ray. I have never experienced anything like it.”When Hinton convinces the prison warden about halfway through his three decades of imprisonment to allow him to receive books – besides the Bible – so that he can form a book club, the reader shares the exhilaration of Hinton and half a dozen of his fellow prisoners as they are finally able to travel outside the walls of the prison, through the words of James Baldwin and Harper Lee. But the book club is short-lived, after the prisoners who are left out of it convince the warden it is unfair to allow only some of them to become readers. The books are still passed around from cell to cell, but the meetings in the prison library are over.After every level of the Alabama court system had rejected Hinton’s appeals multiple times, his lawyer decided to take his case directly to the US supreme court. In 2015, Hinton’s 30 years of unbroken prayers were answered and the nation’s highest court ruled unanimously in his favor. Fourteen months later, the district attorney in Alabama finally abandoned the case, and Hinton went free.Since then, Hinton has been able to forgive everyone responsible for his imprisonment, “because that’s how my mother raised me” and “because I have a God who forgives”. He has become an inspirational speaker, traveling the country and the world. He has one message for everyone who will listen: “Our system is broken, and it’s time to put a stop to the death penalty. As my good friend Bryan Stevenson says, the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice – but justice needs help.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d88c56cc39a9859cf189bf41e27add5dadeae3c2/0_308_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5efaef059c31d66e36435859ac41f4f5","title":"armenias ruling party bows out of pm race to avoid confrontation","story":"Opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan calls on parliament to elect him after mass protests oust longtime ruler Serzh SargsyanArmenia’s ruling party will not put up a candidate for prime minister as it attempts to ease tensions after more than two weeks of street protests. Demonstrations against the party and official corruption forced Serzh Sargsyan, a former president, to resign as prime minister on 23 April and the parliament is due to pick a new one on 1 May. While its majority in parliament means it should be able to choose who that is, the Republican party announced on Saturday it will not to put forward its own candidate. “By not putting forward a candidate, we will avoid confrontation and an increase in security risks,” party spokesman Eduard Sharmazanov said. “We are not putting anyone forward in the state’s interest.“ Protest leader Nikol Pashinyan, a member of parliament who describes himself as “the people’s choice”, has said the parliament should elect him prime minister next week. He then wants snap parliamentary polls under a new election law. On Saturday he called on supporters to continue protests and to organise big, non-violent demonstrations in the capital Yerevan on 1 May. “All protest actions, actions of civil disobedience, should be renewed with new force. The victory of the people must be recognised,” Pashinyan, 42, told a rally in the town of Ijevan.The Republican party has 58 seats in the 105-seat parliament, so Pashinyan is unlikely to be elected without the party’s support. However, the second biggest party in the parliament, Prosperous Armenia, hinted it might support him. “My team and I will vote for a people’s candidate, whether it’s Nikol Pashinyan or anyone else nominated by the people,” the Prosperous Armenia leader, Gagik Tsarukyan, told Kentron TV. A junior coalition member, the Dashnaktsutyun party, said this week it was quitting the government and favoured an early election, but it was unclear whether it would vote for Pashinyan, who has a history of political activism and opposition. Although the demonstrations have been peaceful, the upheaval has threatened to destabilise Armenia, an ally of Russia, in a volatile region riven by Armenia’s decades-long, low-level conflict with neighbouring Azerbaijan. The next parliamentary elections are not due until 2022. But if the parliament fails twice to elect a new prime minister with majority support, early elections must be held."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16e00e75dc5dcab0b3117dae8cff980942cb5fe0/0_125_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b7ea4849a94285542a873c553d6b92a","title":"ramadan eid fun fashion halal lipstick retailers economy","story":"Muslims observing Ramadan are increasingly being targeted by supermarkets and brands in the UK, which has led to a rise in spending on food and gifts during the month, according to new research.The Ramadan economy in the UK is worth at least £200m, with supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons increasingly gearing products, displays and special offers on popular food items to Ramadan in areas with significant Muslim populations. This year, for example, Morrisons is selling a Ramadan countdown calendar, similar to an Advent calendar, aimed at children.The month-long Muslim religious observance starts in mid-May and its ending is marked with the Eid al-Fitr holiday. MAC cosmetics, the Body Shop and Goa chocolates are some of the brands specifically packaging goods as Eid gifts.Despite the trend, more than three-quarters of British Muslims want retailers to pay even more attention to Ramadan, according to the Great British Ramadan, a study by an Islamic marketing consultancy Ogilvy Noor.“Muslims feel that Ramadan and Eid are ignored, the report says. “They see the nation proudly gravitate towards cultural and religious holidays such as Chinese New Year and Diwali. They are saying it’s also time to embrace Ramadan and Eid.”In an indication of growing awareness of the lucrative opportunities of the Muslim market, Westfield London, Europe’s largest shopping centre, is hosting its first Eid festival in June. It will include live catwalk shows, pop-up food stalls, special offers and performances.“The Muslim pound is seen as a valuable and largely untapped opportunity in the UK economy,” says festival promotional material.The global Islamic economy is forecast to be worth more than £3 trillion by 2021, according to the State of the Global Islamic Economy report, and is growing at nearly double the rate of the general worldwide economy. The sector includes halal food, Islamic finance, halal travel, modest fashion, halal media and recreation, and halal pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.Shelina Janmohamed, vice-president of Ogilvy Noor and author of a 2016 book, Generation M: Young Muslims Changing the World, says: “The Ramadan season is one of complete life transformation, which brings with it an economic surge.“We conservatively estimate this to be upwards of £200m each year, covering everything from financial planning to food, eating out, clothes, toys and gifting. Following only Christmas and Easter in scale and size, this is surely Britain’s biggest untapped business opportunity.”Many of the UK’s four million Muslims begin to prepare for Ramadan two weeks before its start date, which is determined by the lunar calendar. The month is characterised by sunrise-to-sunset fasting. Although in some countries the working day is adjusted to accommodate the season, for many British Muslims the fasting requirement is complicated by the need to continue working or studying.For the second year running, Ramadan falls within the six-week summer exam season, which means hundreds of thousands of school and university students have to take exams when their concentration may be impaired by lack of sleep, food and water.The absence of official recognition in the UK of the three-day Eid holiday immediately following the end of Ramadan means traditional visits to family and friends end up being spread over two weekends.“In the UK, you don’t have three days of shutdown over Eid like you do in the Middle East,” says Janmohamed. “Only about half of people take time off work, so Eid visits and celebrations are spread out.”She said brands and retailers should wake up to the opportunities of the Ramadan season. “If brands can play a useful role in Muslims’ experience of Ramadan, if they can help with planning or freeing up time for spiritual or social activities, that is very welcome.”Almost two-thirds of Muslims plan financially for Ramadan and Eid, the study found. More than half are concerned about their concentration during the month-long daylight fast and two-thirds worry about dehydration. Young men in particular are concerned about maintaining fitness and some gyms in areas with big Muslim populations adjust opening times to allow exercise between iftar, the sunset meal that breaks the fast, and suhoor, the pre-dawn meal.The majority of British Muslims eat a range of food over the two meals, with chicken and chips a favourite for 18-to-24-year-olds. Despite the long hours of fasting, four in 10 married women say putting on weight during Ramadan is a worry.

But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

The condition of a school for children with autism and profound intellectual disabilities in Co Cork has been compared to that of an orphanage in an underdeveloped country.They say the school, which has 43 pupils aged between four and 18, has not received any major refurbishment since it opened 20 years ago and students are going without physiotherapyoccupational therapy rooms or a sensory garden.Concerned parents and the school’s management have set up a Go Fund Me page in an attempt to raise funds after growing frustrated at the lack of action on addressing the issues by the Department of Education.“The parents say they feel forgotten. These are children who should be our number one priority,” he said.Sinead Desmond, chair of St Gabriel’s Parent’s Association, says the principal and teachers do everything in their power to assist the students, who are all non verbal, but that the primitive surroundings they find themselves in make this difficult.Ms Desmond said that when the building was originally purchased in the 1990s it was never intended for use as a special needs school. She said it was not suitably upgraded and the conditions resemble those seen in documentaries about old-fashioned orphanages in underdeveloped countries.“This is happening in Cork. My son Max’s wheelchair doesn’t fit in to the toilets in the school. So there are no toilet facilities for children in wheelchairs. It is fine when Max is seven and he is small and they can lift him on to a changing bed,” she said. “But they have men there who are 17 and 18 years old and are 6ft tall with complex medical needs. They are trying to maintain their dignity and they can’t. “Ms Desmond said many of the children have compromised immune systems which leave them vulnerable to infection in bad conditions.She said the school’s principal gave parents her blessing to speak out about the issues because they are running out of time after years of unsuccessfully applying for funding.“Our children only get one shot at childhood. Their childhood already has so many limitations and struggles that their school building really shouldn’t be one of them,” she said. “In Max’s classroom you used to have to open the door and stand back and a gush of dirty water from the roof would fall down. They had buckets collecting water in the classroom. The children in the senior side have nothing.”She added: “Regardless of how bad the building is (the students) love going to school every day. They love the staff. The principal is like a mom to those children but this building is substandard.”St Gabriel’s Special School, which is under the patronage of the Brothers of Charity Southern Services, is hoping to raise €200,000 through its online appeal.A Department of Education spokesman said the Government was committed to ensuring every child with special educational needs had the opportunity to fulfil their potential. He said the department was aware of the accommodation needs at St Gabriel’s and is committed to working with the school to address these."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3477012.1524866216!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cervicalcheck chief did not want some women told of false results","story":"Tánaiste Simon Coveney has apologised to Vicky Phelan and her family, the 43-year-old mother of two was incorrectly given the all-clear from a smear test taken in 2011.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVicky Phelan from Annacotty, Co Limerick, was not told about an incorrect 2011 smear test until September 2017, despite a 2014 audit by CervicalCheck showing that the test was wrong. Photograph: Collins CourtsThe clinical director of the national cervical cancer screening programme advised a Limerick gynaecologist to file some audited test results rather than to tell women in certain cases that all-clear smear tests they had received years earlier were wrong.Dr Gráinne Flannelly, clinical director of CervicalCheck, told gynaecologist Dr Kevin Hickey in an email in July 2017 that several women in the mid-west region should not be told about the false negative tests discovered in an audit after he wrote to her to confirm that she felt some women with cervical cancer should not be informed about them.The private correspondence was submitted in the High Court case taken by Vicky Phelan, a 43-year-old mother of two with terminal cancer from Annacotty, Co Limerick who was not told about an incorrect 2011 smear test until September 2017, despite a 2014 audit by CervicalCheck showing that the test was wrong.The records emerged after Dr Flannelly publicly acknowledged that she could not say for sure that all of the 206 women who missed early treatment for cervical cancer had been made aware of the situation.Dr Hickey wrote to Dr Flannelly on June 20th, 2017 referring to a list of patients with cervical cancer noting that in three highlighted cases the women should be told about the false smear test results after a 2014 review.“There were other ladies where the review process has altered the original smear report and it looks from your notes that you have felt that these should be filed in the patients’ notes and that no review is necessary,” Dr Hickey wrote to her at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street in Dublin.“I just wanted to confirm that you are happy with this whole process centrally from the Cervical Screening Unit given that it looks that some of the review smears were different from the original.”Dr Flannelly replied on July 7th, 2017 in an email with the subject line “clarification”.“Yes – a balance needs to be struck in deciding who needs a formal communication of the outcome of the audit. The possibility of resultant harm is crucial,” she wrote.In cases where women have not had cancer or who have “local and fertility-sparing surgery”, Dr Hickey should “simply file” the audited test results in the patients’ medical notes, Dr Flannelly wrote.“The concept of delay is important,” she said. “I based my judgment on the medical information available to me and using the same criteria I use in my own practice when dealing with these cases. Only three of the women merited a closeout meeting using these criteria,” Dr Flannelly wrote.On August 8th, 2017, after being told by Dr Hickey that he had taken it upon himself to inform all the affected women, Dr Flannelly wrote to him again, noting his decision and saying that this “underscores the value of the local clinician reviewing the clinical context”.“The advice I gave was based on the limited information available to me and was given as an honest assessment of what seemed to be the best way to proceed with these cases,” she said.“It is right and fitting that your own clinical judgment should take precedence.” Yesterday, Minister for Health Simon Harris appointed a senior team of experts to examine the cases of the 206 women who missed early treatment for cervical cancer and to assess how many were not made aware of the delay in diagnosis.The appointments followed Mr Harris’s failure to declare confidence in the leadership of the programme. A HSE spokeswoman said Prof Flannelly would be “continuing in her role” and was “directly involved” in the process to provide assurance around the communications with the 206 women whose cases were under review.Asked about doctors using their “judgment” on whether to inform patients of wrong test results, the spokeswoman said the “practice was deemed to be appropriate and is in line with the practice in the UK for the communication of cancer audit reviews”."},{"url":null,"title":"bertie ahern abruptly ends interview after being questioned on mahon tribunal","story":"  April 21, 2018Former taoiseach \u0026lsquohappy\u0026rsquo he cleared his name after allegations he received payments   April 22, 2018Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader praises former taoiseach\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquotireless work for peace\u0026rsquo in Northern Ireland "},{"url":null,"title":"cork looks set to go to the wire in referendum on eight amendment","story":"  April 28, 2018Both sides in abortion referendum believe they have the edge.

Photograph: AFP PHOTOKCNA VIA KNSDays after an historic summit between North and South Korea, Kim Jong-un has said he will close his country’s Punggye-ri nuclear test site next month and foreign observers will be permitted to witness the dismantling of the facilities.Developments are moving quickly after Friday’s landmark summit between Mr Kim and South Korean president Moon Jae-in, which resulted in a joint agreement to denuclearise the Korean peninsula and formally end the Korean War (1950-53) that concluded in an armistice but not a proper peace treaty.“Although I am inherently resistant to America, people will see that I am not the kind of person who fires nukes at South Korea, the Pacific or America,” Mr Kim said, quoted by Moon Jae-in’s chief press secretary Yoon Young-chan.“Why would we keep nuclear weapons and live in a difficult condition if we often meet with Americans to build trust and they promise us to end the war and not to invade us?”Mr Kim said he would not repeat the “painful history of the Korean War.”“Concrete measures are necessary to stop any accidental military confrontation from happening,” he said.Mr Moon has agreed to hold an early summit with US president Trump and Mr Kim, and would closely coordinate to ensure the upcoming summit leads to an agreement on concrete measures to denuclearise North Korea, Mr Yoon said.The key issue emerging was the need for “the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea,” said Mr Yoon.Mr Trump spoke on the telephone with the South Korean president for one hour and 15 minutes. He also confirmed the summit during a rally in Michigan.“I think we will have a meeting over the next three or four weeks,” he said.Mr Trump was full of praise for the summit for moving forward inter-Korean ties, particularly the reaffirmation of the goal of denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.South Korea has emphasised the close relationship with the US, alongside which it fought in the Korean War and where 28,500 US troops are still stationed.Mr Trump tweeted that he had a “long and very good talk” with Mr Moon and things were going very well.The time and location for the first-ever US-North Korea with Mr Kim was still being set but they have now narrowed the possible site to two or three countries.“The two leaders agreed that South Korea and the United States should continue to closely coordinate so that the planned US-North Korea summit could generate an agreement on concrete measures to realise complete denuclearisation,” a South Korean government official said.The deal is the main topic of conversation in South Korea.When a Seoul resident is asked about the talks, they tend to pause, even freeze. The prospect of peace, and of closer relations with a country where many people have relatives living and which has been such a huge threat for more than six decades, is almost too much to bear.“It’s incredible. It’s peace. Is it really peace? Am I dreaming?” said one young woman, surnamed Kim – Kim is similar to Murphy in Ireland as a family name, no relation is implied.“I’m happy, but I’m also scared. My grandparents live in North Korea and can you imagine how it would be to see them?” said one young businessman, whose surname is Park.In a side note, which is also hugely symbolic, the North Korean leader said he would align the time zones used in South and North Korea - Seoul is currently 30 minutes ahead of Pyongyang."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

In practice, this means the infection is resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.The figures have emerged as Lord O\u0027Neill, the former Goldman Sachs banker who led a government-commissioned review into superbugs, accuses senior ministers of a lack of leadership on the issue. Lord O’Neill, former commercial secretary to the Treasury, said the Prime Minister, Theresa May, had allowed the issue to fade and that actions promised had not been taken.Lord O\u0026#39Neill has urged senior ministers to do more to tackle the threat of superbugs“It is disappointing to see that the UK government’s global and national efforts to fight AMR seem to have faded, he saidWriting exclusively for the  Lord O’Neill said that the UK was once seen as a leader in the field but that May had allowed the issue to slide.“The government should put this part of \u0027global Britain\u0027 back at the top of its priorities,” he writes. “There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O’Neill’s review warned that if left unchecked antibiotic resistance would kill 10 million people and the world economy could lose up to $100 trillion by 2050.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldOfficial figures suggest antimicrobial resistance claims the lives of 5,000 people a year in the UK, though experts have argued the real figure is at least double that. Getting global figures on the problem is difficult but reliable estimates suggest 700,000 are already dying each year – one person a minute.Lord O’Neill also attacked the major pharmaceutical companies for doing little to counter the problem, despite signing up to the Davos Declaration in 2015, where they pledged to combat the threat.He wrote: “Since then, no major pharmaceutical company has taken any fresh action.”Lord O’Neill said that since investigating the issue the number of reports of antibiotic resistance was rising faster and “in more places than we ever dreamt of.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O\u0026#x27NeillIn addition to the ‘super gonorrhoea’ case the PHE figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, show 29 people suffered from pan-drug-resistant-infections from Pseudomonas bacteria.Pseudomonas is a bug often found in soil or water (hospital sinks are tested for it) that usually affects people with a weaker immune system such as cancer patients, newborn babies, people with diabetes or patients with severe burns.Up to 11 per cent of Pseudomonas bacteria are now resistant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used in combination with others.A further six patients suffered pan-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections. New antibiotics to treat multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections were introduced last year in light of rising resistance, said Professor Peter Hawkey, a public health and bacteriology expert at the University of Birmingham. But they don’t work against every strain, he said.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsProf Hawkey added that the cases show antimicrobial resistance is not a hypothetical or future threat but a real one currently affecting patients in British hospitals.These are organisms which are resistant to most antibiotics and then you’re in a tricky place, he said. The threat is very real. These figures are a wake up call,” he said.The pan-resistant infections recorded by PHE were from gram negative bacteria: rod-shaped bugs with thinner cell walls than their gram positive counterparts.Gram negative bacteria, some of which live in the human gut, are fast becoming resistant to antibiotics and are known as an emerging global threat. The government aims to halve the number of healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections by 2021.Prof Hawkey said pan-drug-resistant-infections are much more common in other areas of the world with lax surveillance and poor infection control, and these will spread to Britain.He said: With huge movement in populations people are coming back to the UK with these bugs in their guts. If you get it and you’re given the wrong antibiotic, you will die.Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director for AMR and healthcare acquired infections at Public Health England, said: “While there is only a small number of bacteria identified that were resistant to a number of treatments in recent years, they serve as an example of the threat antibiotic resistance poses to public health.Madlen Davies is a reporter with the Bureau of Investigative JournalismProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security EU considering \u0026#39freeze\u0026#39 on subsidies for illiberal member statesWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsWhat\u0026#39s in a name?

It is also one of the Duke of Cambridge\u0027s own middle names.Kensington Palace said: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son Louis Arthur Charles.The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge showing their third child to the world outside the Lindo Wing on MondayThe name is a significant tribute to the Royal Family, with the newborn Prince sharing names in common with his brother Prince George Alexander Louis, his father Prince William Arthur Philip Louis, and his grandfather Prince Charles Philip Arthur George.Kensington Palace announced the name of the Royal couple\u0027s third child, who was born on Monday at 11.01am weighing 8lb 7oz.The Duke and Duchess will have shared the name with the Queen and the rest of their family before making it public.The announcement had been eagerly anticipated since the couple showed off their new son to the world on the steps of the exclusive maternity unit, the Lindo Wing, on Monday evening.Popularity of the boys\u0027 name Louis since 1904Since then, the Duke and Duchess have been kept busy settling in to life as a family of five at Kensington Palace.Born fifth in line, the baby is the Queen and Philip\u0027s sixth great-grandchild and Kensington Palace said the couple, along with the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry, and the Middletons, were delighted with the news of the new arrival. The Duke of Cambridge joined his brother Prince Harry and soon-to-be sister-in-law Meghan Markle at Westminster Abbey for an Anzac Day service on Wednesday afternoon.But the topic of conversation quickly turned to the new Prince.It\u0027s a boy Celebrating the Royal baby -

one for each of his children - when departing from hospital and laughed that he had “thrice the worry now”.The Duke of Cambridge holds up three fingers as he tells the media he has \u0026#39thrice the worry now\u0026#39 as he leaves the Lindo Wing Louis was the first name of the Prince of Wales\u0027 beloved great-uncle Earl Mountbatten of Burma.Charles will be touched that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge decided to pay tribute to Lord Mountbatten, who was murdered by the IRA in 1979, by naming their son Prince Louis.The name, also one of Prince George\u0027s middle names, is French and German in origin and means renowned warrior.Louis was the 71st most popular name in England and Wales, according to the latest available figures from the Office for National Statistics.In 2016, just 911 boys were given the name Louis in England and Wales.It was more popular in the early 2000s when it ranked around 39th, but was not popular throughout the 20th century.Louis has been the name of many rulers across the world, including 18 kings of France.Lord Louis Mountbatten pictured in 1977, two years before he was murdered by the IRAFamous people named Louis include pop star Louis Tomlinson from One Direction and jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong.Lord Louis Mountbatten was also the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s uncle and the brother of Philip\u0027s mother Princess Alice.He was the last British Viceroy of India before independence in 1947.He was very close to Charles but Uncle Dickie, as he was known in the family, was assassinated by the IRA in August 1979.His boat was blown up on a fishing trip off the coast of County Sligo in the Republic of Ireland.Prince George and Princess Charlotte had already been introduced to the new baby at St Mary’s Hospital and were likely being eased into their new roles as big brother and middle sister in their own home on Tuesday.Pippa Matthews, the first visitor seen driving into the Palace, spent several hours with her sister, the Duchess, and infant nephew before being photographed driving away.Pippa Middleton pictured leaving Kensington Palace on Tuesday afternoonParents Carole and Michael Middleton were unlikely to have been far away, famously supportive of the Duke and Duchess and their growing brood.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, too, could surely not have kept away from joining the first eager visitors, living just next door and both adoring children.The Prince once called George and Charlotte “the most amazing things ever”.The Queen, who was in Windsor, is unlikely to meet her sixth great-grandchild imminently, with further duties at the castle on Wednesday, while the Duke of Edinburgh is recuperating privately from a hip replacement operation.The Queen horse riding at Windsor on Monday before the latest Royal baby was bornThe Prince of Wales, who was on Tuesday travelling to France in time for a dawn service to commemorate the Battle of Villers-Bretonneux on Anzac Day, will pay his first visit to hold the baby on his return from duty.Other family members earlier remained tight-lipped about the baby\u0027s name. The Countess of Wessex, who was conducting a string of engagements near Truro, Cornwall, said during a visit to Tregolls School on Tuesday: “I’m thrilled for them all, it’s lovely - really good news.”Asked about the baby’s name, she added tactfully: “The jury’s out on that one.

Indeed they say it has already had a detrimental impact on rare breeds such as the Mediterranean Gull, curlews and lapwings.Mr Allaway estimates the number of visitors arriving by boat has risen from 40 a day, to around 200, with a significant increase in kayakers and paddleboarders.They predict recent moves by the trust to promote Newtown as a visitor attraction - a large poster urging people to “explore” the reserve greets arrivals at Lymington Ferry Terminal a bear hunts for children have been organised at the site - will only exacerbate the problem.Mr Allaway said: “Our concern is that over promoting it and over commercialising it will only lead to its destruction by the sheer number of visitors who will come. The number of people who visit needs to be carefully controlled. The more publicity there is the more people will come, with visitors cutting through the woods and driving away wildlife such as owls, lizards and nightingales.“Mediterranean Gulls have recently started breeding in the lagoon, but they will be under threat from any further increase in visitor numbers and from growing numbers of dog walkers.”A view of Newtown Nature Reserve on the Isle of Wight Matters came to a head when the National Trust30. unveiled plans to refurbish the nature reserve’s visitor centre, which Mr Allaway and Ms Gwynn said had the effect of sidelining a much loved mural by local artist Anne TomsThe pair say the refurbishment was symptomatic of a tendency by the trust to excessively commercialise attractions to the detriment of the unique environment that makes them so appealing in the first place.“After we objected to their plans for the new visitor centre we were told that our services were no longer required as we were ‘contrary to their values’. It was particularly upsetting for Val, who has been associated with the trust for 30 years. It’s sent shockwaves through the community here.”The National Trust defended its plans for Newtown National Nature Reserve, - the only such reserve on the island - saying they would protect the site while still making it attractive for visitors, But it admitted it had faced opposition from volunteers and that its relationship with two of them had “broken down”.A black headed gull at Newtown Nature ReserveThe charity said: “Our absolute priority is – and has always been – to ensure wildlife can thrive at this special habitat and that people can continue to enjoy visiting it. We recently proposed some minor changes to the existing workshop space on the site, which will include a basic reception point where visitors are able to find information about the nature reserve and make themselves a hot drink. It’s clearly not a commercial venture and would have little impact on revenues.”It added: “We always appreciate honest views about our plans, and on this occasion we did have some opposition from a group of volunteers. We invited them several times for discussions to listen to their concerns and to reassure them that we would never do anything to compromise conservation.”“Unfortunately, we eventually reached a point with two iniduals where the relationship had completely broken down and we felt it was in the interest of both parties to go our separate ways.”A board showing recent bird sightings at Newton Nature ReserveIsle of WightEU considering \u0026#39freeze\u0026#39 on subsidies for illiberal member statesWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsWhat\u0026#39s in a name?

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike. The first to say, ‘My company guarantees that casts and crews will be erse.’Jordan: That’s super important to me. No matter what community we’re talking about. Everybody should be in a position where they can win.Washington: I’m just wired that way.Jordan: My path is my path. I can’t take nothing away from nobody, and nobody can take nothing away from me. I’m running my race. But we can still encourage each other.Washington: What’s the harm in that? You’ll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In his capacity as head of the CIA, Mr Pompeo travelled to North Korea to lay the groundwork for the high-stakes summit.While Mr Trump has heralded the opportunity for a deal to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, both Mr Bolton and Mr Pompeo have evinced scepticism about the sincerity of North Korea’s motives.In addition to helping prepare the North Korea summit, Mr Pompeo will help the White House navigate a crucial and fast-approaching deadline for the Iran nuclear deal.Mr Trump must decide by mid-May whether to continue lifting sanctions on Iran, as dictated by the pact. Both the president and Mr Pompeo have heaped disdain on the agreement, and Mr Trump said in January that he was agreeing to waive some sanctions “only in order to secure our European allies’ agreement to fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal”.“This is a last chance. In the absence of such an agreement, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal”, Mr Trump said at the time.During a visit to Washington this week, French president Emmanuel Macron worked to persuade Donald Trump to preserve the deal. But Mr Macron conceded he faced slim odds of succeeding.“My view – I don’t know what your president will decide – is that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons,” Mr Macron told reporters.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They have provided support and provided a home for a child in need.It is therefore right that Government supports them in doing so. That is why today I am extending the existing support for children and families in these circumstances.Universal Credit is currently being rolled out across the country."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000402052678.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"james forsyth local elections","story":"The thinking was disastrous local election results would shock Tory MPs into realising they cannot go on like that and that they needed a new leader.But even Mrs May’s most ardent critics have now accepted that next week’s local elections are unlikely to trigger her downfall.Why? Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our resort team are in direct contact with the customers to resolve the situation.“We’d like to reassure all customers that instances such of these are rare.”"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle jessica mulroney wedding dress plans","story":"Stylist Jessica Mulroney, who’s displayed a very similar dress sense to the royal bride-to- be, jetted into Heathrow for a girls’ weekend.It included another “mini hen party” for pals who missed Meghan’s first at Soho Farmhouse in March.Meghan, 36, and Jessica — also a wedding planner in Toronto, Canada — attended the fitting at a top-secret location and paid a visit to the Windsor church where Meg will wed Prince Harry on May 19.A royal source said: “Jessica is Meghan’s BFF (best friend forever) and has been a huge influence.“Meghan’s turned to her for advice on everything from the dress, the flowers, decorations in church, the wedding lunch — and even the seating plan.“She is the real power behind the throne in this royal wedding and has been invaluable.“Although Jess lives in Toronto, the two are on the phone all the time. Meg wanted Jess at the final fitting as it’ll be the most famous dress of the year and she’s quite nervous about it. It all went really well and they were delighted with the result.”Jessica and her husband were among the first to meet Harry, 32, when he started dating Meghan.The source continued: “The dress is the biggest secret of the wedding – not even Harry knows who’s designing it.The dress has had to be taken in a bit as Meg has lost a bit of weight, but that’s entirely normal for all brides before their big day.“Meghan has had fittings at a London atelier, not her home. There are two dresses - one for the church and then another glamorous outfit for the evening party.”Last week The Sun on Sunday revealed Meg needed alterations to her dress as she had lost weight.We reported it’s a Ralph and Russo design but a fashion insider this week said Canadian designer Erdem is also in the frame. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It aims to force a binding Parliamentary vote on the draft deal while talks are still ongoing.Crucially, if the deal is rejected, MPs and peers would then have power to instruct ministers what action to take – even if it means stopping Brexit.Last night, angry Brexiteers accused peers of sneaky and dishonest tactics to frustrate our departure from the EU.Brexit Minister Lord Callanan said: “Labour’s flawed amendment seeks to tie our hands by inserting false deadlines and shifting the power to negotiate from government to Parliament.“It asks for meaningless votes on the deal before the deal is done. Those who want to overturn the referendum call this the ‘no Brexit’ amendment.“The Conservatives are taking the scrutinising role of Parliament seriously, to improve an essential piece of legislation.
