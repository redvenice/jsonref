I\u0027m so happy to be joining the natural immunity club. Going to have a nap.\u0027 There has been much debate about the effectiveness of ivermectin during the pandemic after it was hailed as vaccine sceptics as a miracle cure. The hype started early in the pandemic when ivermectin was shown to destroy the virus in lab studies. Several dozen trials have also indicated that the pills may have some value in the pandemic - either by using them on patients with Covid, or as a preventative.But, according to a BBC investigation last year, around a third of studies advocating ivermectin\u0027s use were seriously flawed or biased in some way, making the results unreliable. Reviews by health authorities in the US, UK and EU have found there is insufficient evidence for using the drug against Covid.The first double-blind, gold-standard clinical trial into ivermectin is currently being carried out in Oxford, as part of the PRINCIPLE trial.Definitive results on the drug are expected this year.  Currently in the UK, health watchdogs do not recommend any clinicians prescribe the drug but, as a safe and approved medicine, it can be obtained privately. Fox recently got engaged to prep school teacher Arabella Fleetwood Neagle, 28.Miss Fleetwood Neagle apparently supports his political campaigning as she was pictured alongside him on the top deck of his Reclaim Party\u0027s battle bus during his unsuccessful bid to become London Mayor last year.Fox – whose acting dynasty includes his father James and cousin Emilia – was dropped by his agent in 2020 after a string of social media comments.Last year he said he could remove his children from school over his opposition to the Covid vaccination programme.He said he would educate them at home rather than let them be vaccinated without his consent.Fox shares custody of his boys with Miss Piper, whom he orced in 2016.  "},{"url":null,"title":"NFL legend Tom Brady 44 says decided return Tampa Bay Bucs","story":"Share this articleTom Brady says he still hasn\u0027t made a decision on retirement - CBS NewsTom Brady’s contract makes potential retirement complicated for Buccaneers - The Boston Globe"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/12/08/16/3B2EB06B00000578-0-image-a-78_1481215945206.jpg","title":"Austria makes Covid vaccination COMPULSORY 18s today","story":"Share this articleThousands protest in Vienna against mandatory vaccination | Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"Thousands civil servants resist calls work office","story":"Share this articleFew signs of Whitehall returning to the office | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Covid vaccine rates SIX TIMES higher Chinese pupils Black Caribbeans data shows","story":"Share this articleDr Shamez Ladhani, a consultant paediatrician at the UK Health Security Agency and the study\u0027s chief investigator, said the data \u0027provides a real insight into attitudes towards vaccination – which has been proven to protect against hospitalisation and severe disease\u0027.He added: \u0027With Covid case rates currently high across school-age groups, it\u0027s vital that we monitor and evaluate measures that help reduce transmission.\u0027We need families and students to continue to take part in the programme.\u0027    The ONS team also found that Covid vaccine uptake increased with age, with 77.2 per cent of 17-year-olds having come forward for at least one jab.Children aged 12 had the lowest uptake, with 48.7 per cent having at least one injection.Just over half of 13-year-olds had received their first dose, while the figures for children aged 14 (54.1 per cent), 15 (56.4 per cent) and 16 (66.7 per cent) were slightly higher. Jabs were offered to 16 and 17-year-olds on August 15, while 12 to 15-year-olds could get their first dose five weeks later, which could explain some of this disparity. And the ONS noted that not all children in these age groups will be currently eligible for vaccination, such as if they have tested positive in the previous 12 weeks.The statisticians also found vaccination rates varied by region. Children in the South East were most likely to be jabbed, with 60.7 per cent of 12 to 15-year-olds having at least one dose. London has the lowest jab rates, at just 40.8 per cent.Vaccine uptake was also lower than the national average among pupils in Yorkshire and the Humber (51.8 per cent), the West Midlands (49.8 per cent) and the North West (48.8 per cent).  Deprivation levels also influenced how vaccinated youngsters are, according to the ONS data.In the wealthiest areas of the country, 70.3 per cent of 12 to 15-year-olds are vaccinated, while the uptake is nearly half this figure among those living in the poorest parts of the country (36.1 per cent). Students eligible for free school meals were also less likely to be vaccinated, as are children whose first language is not English.  Fiona Dawe, deputy director of wider surveillance studies at the ONS, said there are \u0027many different factors\u0027 contributing to vaccine rates including geography, deprivation and ethnicity.She said some of the disparity across the country may be down to different deprivation levels in different regions.It comes after ministers announced on Sunday that Covid jabs would be offered to vulnerable five to 11-year-olds in England, such as those with learning disabilities and diabetes. The UK\u0027s medicines watchdog approved a low dosage of the vaccine for the age group in December, after finding it was safe and effective. However, a questionnaire sent to more than 3,000 parents in England by the ONS found 24 per cent were unlikely to agree with their child getting the jab.Concerns about the side effects and wanting to see how effective it is in the age group were cited as the main reasons for parent hesitancy, the researchers said. "},{"url":null,"title":"Keep Wordle free say players bought New York Times","story":"Share this articleWordle: Countdown\u0027s Susie Dent hopes game will remain free - BBC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Ultra rare BLACK tigers captured camera India","story":"Share this articleThe reason ‘black tigers’ exist and why that is dangerous - The Financial Express"},{"url":null,"title":"Nicola Sturgeon extends Scotlands masks schools rules week","story":"Share this article However, she told Holyrood that overall the \u0027most recent data continues to give grounds for optimism\u0027, with the First Minister saying that \u0027the situation we are in now is much less severe than we had thought it might be\u0027.She added that the fall in cases over the first three weeks of January was \u0027now reflected in a fall in the number of people being admitted to hospital\u0027.Last week, 602 patients with Covid were admitted to hospital, down from 768 in the week ending January 21.The latest figures also showed 1,177 people in hospital have Covid – down from 1,394 a week ago – with the number in intensive care also decreasing.Ms Sturgeon, speaking the day after a relaxation of the requirement for home working, told MSPs: \u0027We can continue to be optimistic, as we look ahead to spring.\u0027Case levels are likely to remain high for some time – and may increase further as a result of the recent easing of protections.\u0027But there are good grounds for confidence that we are again entering a calmer phase of the pandemic.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Daily Covid cases jump fifth week 112 458 officials start count reinfections","story":"Share this article Just 0.23 per cent of all confirmed cases led to deaths in England before the long-awaited addition of reinfections, UK Health Security Agency statistics suggest. However, the rate for exactly the same time period — which relates to mid-January — has now dropped to 0.21 per cent because of the addition of extra cases. This is still slightly above flu, which has a case-fatality rate of around 0.1 per cent. But some experts claim the two figures are very similar, even if coronavirus is much more transmissible. Professor Hunter said reinfections were \u0027almost always\u0027 milder than primary infections.He added: \u0027Consequently, we can expect the severity of Covid to decrease further as more and more of the daily infections are reinfections.\u0027MailOnline calculated the case fatality rate (CFR) — used by epidemiologists to check the severity of a disease —  by iding the seven-day average of Covid cases by deaths two weeks later.A lag was built in because of the time taken for someone who catches the virus to die from the disease. Latest data for January 12 — the latest date available to calculate the CFR — showed 91,955 people were testing positive for the first time every day, on average. At the same time, fatalities — defined as deaths within 28 days of a positive test — stood at roughly 213. But in last night\u0027s update to include 588,114 reinfections since the pandemic began, the average number of cases for January 12 shot up by 10,000. This pushed the CFR down slightly from its previous level. Covid death numbers were not only those fatalities directly due to the virus, which likely would have pushed the CFR even lower. Covid reinfections were rare at the start of the pandemic because so few Britons had caught the virus due to lockdowns and stringent self-isolation rules.The UKHSA — which defines reinfections as when someone tests positive for the virus more than 90 days after a previous positive swab — logged its first in June 2020, just four months into the pandemic. Reinfections accounted for less than two per cent of Covid cases — or one in 50 infections — during the Alpha and Delta waves that struck the UK.But since the arrival of Omicron they have been ticking upwards, with the variant known to be better at evading previous immunity.At the end of December reinfections made up about eight per cent of cases, but they are now behind more than 11 per cent.Despite the rise, Professor Hunter said there was no sign that reinfections were changing the course of the current Omicron wave. He added that there was no need to impose further restrictions to tackle them. Experts said last night the addition of the figures could also be an early warning sign of waning immunity, helping officials determine when extra booster shots might be needed.UK officials have already secured enough Covid doses to roll out fourth shots if needed in the coming months — and other countries including Israel have already launched revaccination campaigns. As well as the reinfections, UKHSA bosses also logged an additional 173,328 \u0027formerly unreported\u0027 cases.The revision pushed up the UK\u0027s official cumulative tally by 4.1 per cent to 14.8million confirmed cases since the pandemic began.But only England and Northern Ireland are currently reporting reinfection figures. Scotland and Wales say they will also start to publish the statistics in the coming days. Britain has recorded 156,000 Covid deaths since March 2020. Other surveillance measures paint a similar picture.The ONS — which counts fatalities by mentions of the virus on death certificates — says the toll stands at around 178,000.But the proportion down to the virus is now pointing downwards, with latest Office for National Statistics figures showing one in five Covid fatalities (402 out of 1,484 deaths) were not due to the virus in the week to January 21.For comparison, the share of deaths not primarily due to the virus stood at around 16 per cent when Omicron first arrived in the UK. With the Alpha wave last January, before vaccines were dished out en masse, the proportion was about 10 per cent. "},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education.Languages, health and engineering among areas likely to be needed by 2026Many arts graduates now entering marketing, advertising, journalism, technology and lawInstead of taking the traditional route, Denisa Zima chose an accounting apprenticeshipSubject area profiles: Law and Business"},{"url":null,"title":"leaving cert 2022 to be held as exams only as foley rules out hybrid model","story":"Minister for Education Norma Foley has said significant changes to the Leaving Cert will provide more question options and students will be required to cover less material. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins PhotosMinister for Education Norma Foley said this year’s Leaving Certificate will be held as exams only as she ruled out a hybrid approach to the State exams.The structure of the Leaving Cert will be “radically different”, she said, while the Junior Cert exams will run for the first since 2019.The move came despite repeated calls from students and the Opposition for another hybrid Leaving Cert, which includes written exams and accredited grades, on the basis that many students have experienced significant disruption to their studies due to the pandemic.Speaking after Tuesday morning’s Cabinet meeting, however, Ms Foley said the exams will be “tailor-made” in recognition of the challenges faced by students. There will more question options available and less material for students to cover.“The exams will be structured in a familiar way, but with more choice and a reduction in the number of questions to be answered. This will not be the traditional Leaving Certificate exam,” she said.“For example, in maths students would have 10 questions to answer, now they will have six . . . I want to make clear that the alterations on the exams extend beyond the papers, they extend into the oral, the practical and coursework,” the Minister added.“Students also raised concerns over the potential disadvantage the class of 2022 would face when compared to the class of 2021 in terms of grade inflation. Details of all the changes to the examinations will be sent to schools next week. ‘Alternative exams’Ms Foley said an “alternative set of Leaving Certificate examinations” will operate this year, limited to certain students, “such as those who experience a close family bereavement, Covid-19 illness and certain other categories of serious illness during the first examination period. There will be strict eligibility criteria applying to this contingency sitting.”Changes to the junior-cycle examinations include a reduction in the number of classroom-based assessments to be completed, the removal of the requirement to complete assessment tasks and adjustments to the requirements in coursework and practical performance tests. These adjustments provide for more teaching time in schools, Ms Foley said. The timetable for the written exams – both junior and senior cycle – in June will be published by the SEC in the coming days.Earlier, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said it was important “the integrity of the Leaving Cert is protected”.Mr Coveney said he understood it had been “incredibly stressful for students” but said the problem with the hybrid model was that “one in four students doing their Leaving Cert this year didn’t do their Junior Cert because of Covid”.‘Desperate decision’Opposition parties said they were opposed to any move that would rule out a hybrid option. Sinn Féin education spokesman Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire called the decision to proceed with written exams “desperate”.“Absolutely gutted for Leaving Cert students,” he tweeted. “The Minister has refused to listen to students and failed to understand the level of disruption. Tradition should not trump sense or fairness.”Labour TD Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, who has been campaigning for the hybrid model, said he was “devastated” for students.Ms Foley defended the Cabinet’s decision on Tuesday afternoon, saying she engaged with and listened to students, parents, teachers and school management bodies and had responded to as many concerns as possible.Ms Foley said to attempt to provide accredited grades without Junior Cert data would not be as fair as last year. The Minister added that she was not aware of any jurisdiction that was considering accredited grades.She said she was very disappointed that details of the plans for State exams had been leaked on social media on Monday night. When asked if the leak had come from her department, Ms Foley said: “I’m certain that it didn’t come from me.” – Additional reporting PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"we feel exploited international students on studying in ireland","story":"Ronald Wafula, an international PhD student. ‘It is practically impossible to live any life.’  Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Ronald Wafula wakes before dawn. He uses the quiet time to get some study done before starting on a two-hour and 40-minute journey by bus to college. Originally from Kenya, Wafula is one of some 21,000 international students studying in Ireland, many of whom are struggling.He was elated when he won a scholarship to research a PhD in finance at University College Dublin (UCD) in September 2020. Looking back, he wasn’t prepared for the challenges that lay ahead. Every day is a struggle to make ends meet, he says.His first year of study was online due to Covid restrictions. After securing temporary housing, it took Wafula more than 10 months to find suitable accommodation for his family to come to Ireland. He now lives with his wife – who is not permitted to work under her visa – and one of his children in Rathangan, Co Kildare, while the other child stays in Kenya.Wafula gets a monthly €1,500 scholarship stipend. He has worked as a tutor at the university, but his Stamp 2 visa limits him to work no more than 20 hours each week. His hours are precarious and he does not know if he will get any in the current semester.Meanwhile, his income is quickly swallowed up by his monthly rent (€1,100), electricity (€200) and daily commute (€18 a day).“It is practically impossible to live any life,” he says. “It becomes really hard to say you’re enjoying it.”Wafula admits experiencing mental health difficulties throughout his time here. “You have to put on a bold face, so your wife and kids don’t see that... I’m not enjoying the process, but maybe the outcome, which is getting a PhD and hopefully getting a job,” he says.Wafula wrote to UCD president Andrew Deeks in August, claiming international PhD students were “suffering in silence” and facing “systematic” discrimination during their time in Ireland.In a statement, UCD said international students receive an offer pack that references accommodation, the cost of living and visa advice. While the college generally has sufficient on-campus places for international students, it said that it does not currently have family accommodation.The university said PhD candidates have a student status and are deemed to be under full-time instruction, while scholarship holders are exempt from tax on their scholarship income.They are not normally employees, a spokesman said, and issues around employment are controlled by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.AbroadThe experiences of international students is raising wider questions around Ireland’s policy of attracting more and more students from abroad.While their higher fees are helping to plug holes in third-level funding, many international students argue that they are not being treating fairly and are not adequately warned about the cost of living or scarcity of accommodation.In Ireland, about 17,000 students from outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) are paying €10,000-€20,000 for their courses, though in some cases fees can be as high as €55,000.Most non-EEA students come from the US, China, India, Brazil, Canada and Saudi Arabia. Irish students pay a student contribution charge capped at €3,000.Bukky Adebowale, vice-president for equality and citizenship at the Union of Students in Ireland, says many international students feel they are treated as if they are cash-cows to prop up an under-funded third-level system. “They don’t feel heard,” says Adebowale.Bhumi Mehda, who is studying for a master’s in computer science, is one of them. She was required to have €40,000 in her bank account before being accepted into the State. On top of needing €25,600 for tuition fees at UCD, and after receiving some financial help from her parents, she took out a loan to finance the high cost of living in Ireland – but it still wasn’t enough.After arriving from India with her sister Jill at the end of the summer, she was met with the stark reality of Ireland’s housing crisis. Although they contacted 20-30 places a day, they struggled to find permanent accommodation. The sisters spent a month in temporary accommodation and were “freaking out” in fear of having no place to go.Less than 48 hours before they were due to leave their temporary accommodation, with no place to go, they finally secured a year-long tenancy agreement – but it didn’t come cheap. Bhumi, Jill and two friends now live close to Belfield campus in Dublin 4 and pay €2,500 a month for the two-bedroom house or €625 to share a bedroom far more than they budgeted.The  contacted all Irish universities to ask if they provide warnings to internationals regarding Ireland’s housing crisis prior to arrival. Many give general advice such as “book early” or tell students about “high demand” in the rental market. NUI Galway seems to go further than most by offering virtual “meet and greets” and information sessions for international students. The university also said it invites housing charity Threshold to provide accommodation guidance to incoming internationals.Bukky Adebowale of USI says the “honest truth” must be presented to internationals before coming to Ireland.Laura Harmon, executive director of the Irish Council for International Students, whose members include 30 higher-education institutions, says she does not think colleges are exploiting students. She argues that universities are following the national strategy on internationalising education in Ireland.But why aren’t students allowed to work more than 20 hours each week to cover their high costs? The Department of Justice, which issues their visas, maintains the sole reason for students being in the State is to study. The department said it must ensure students can survive on their own resources without relying on work.Plugging the gapThe move to “internationalise” higher education is Government policy. The Department of Education’s strategy in this area, due an update since 2020, aims to increase the economic output of these students from €819 million in 2014 to €1.15 billion by 2020 and increase the output of the English-language education sector by €200 million. The policy has been bearing fruit non-EEA students have more than doubled since 2011.The supply of lucrative international students has helped plug university finances in the years following the recession and, more recently, during the pandemic.Latest figures show Ireland’s main universities increased their student fee income in the first year of the pandemic at a time when most were confined to remote learning. No refunds were provided to international students neither were they entitled to the once-off €250 payment from the Government.“Maybe universities should not make so much money at the expense of people paying,” says Wafula.Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris is shortly expected to begin long-awaited action on the 2016 Cassells report, which aims to address key funding issues in the sector. International students like Wafula and Bhumi hope they won’t be left behind in the new vision for the sector.International students: in numbers17,000Estimated number of students from outside the European Economic Area studying in IrelandEstimated economic output generated from international studentsTuition fees for most international students"},{"url":null,"title":"lifebuoys around irish coast to provide near realtime data on storms","story":"The Ballybunion Buoy is unhooked from a crane in Dún Laoghaire, ready to be towed to Irish Lights ship ILV Granuaile.Irish navigation lifebuoys are being enhanced with digital devices to enable people to be alerted more promptly on risk of storm surges, high wave conditions and coastal damage.A number of the devices located around the country are already providing “near real-time data” on a trial basis, with a view to extending their use throughout the network of navigation lifebuoys close to the Irish coastline.Navigation buoys operated by Irish Lights equipped with new sensors are providing weather and wave data for Met Éireann’s Flood Forecasting Division “to develop coastal predictive modelling systems for tidal, storm surge and wave forecasting for the country”.Seas around the island of Ireland are changing due to climate change while both organisations are developing new services to help build resilience in the face of inevitable impacts. In line with the Government’s climate priorities, “a better understanding of our adjacent seas is needed including the wave conditions around the Irish coast”, they acknowledged at the launch on Tuesday – which coincided with the feast day of St Brigid, the patron saint of sailors. “We look forward to a successful completion of the trial period and a possible future expansion of this monitoring network for the safety of all,” he added.The data benefits Met Éireann’s forecasts before, during and after coastal flood events. “This meteorological and hydrographic information provided by Irish Lights will support stakeholders to make impact-based decisions and take actions that protect against the loss of life and to mitigate against damage to property and the environment,” Mr Boyle said.

Another 4,622 confirmed cases of the virus have also been notified in the North in its latest 24-hour reporting period. On Tuesday morning, there were 337 Covid-19 inpatients in the North’s hospitals, with 21 in intensive care.Nursing home visitsNew guidance has been published by the HSE that will further ease restrictions on visits to residents of nursing homes from next Tuesday. The new guidelines for nursing home visits will allow one support person who has been nominated by a resident unrestricted visiting access to that resident over the course of a day.The nominated support person will be in addition to, and not instead of, general visitors.In the event of an outbreak, the nominated support person “should continue to have reasonable access for some part of each day if the nominated support person is aware of the risk to them, is prepared to accept that risk and to follow all necessary infection prevention and control measures”. If limits on indoor visits were required during an outbreak, other forms of communication would be facilitated, “including through window visits, outdoor visits, video calls etc”, the guidelines state.Visitors may also visit residents in multi-occupancy rooms in their rooms from next week. Any limitations on visiting during an outbreak should be reviewed twice each week, the guidelines say. There would also be recommendations to visitors to self-test using antigen tests. The guidance will come into effect on Tuesday, February 8th. ‘Important milestone’Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) has welcomed the newly revised visitation guidelines. Chief executive of the NHI Tadhg Daly said he hoped the easing of visitor restrictions would represent a “hugely important milestone for residents and broader society as we look to move on from Covid-19”.“The further easing represents a very welcome and positive development,” he said.Mr Daly said meaningful engagement with family and friends of residents in nursing homes was “vital” to support residents’ wellbeing and health and the guidelines “represented a move to a pre-Covid environment within our nursing homes”.“While outbreaks are still occurring, the vaccination rollout has greatly reduced the risk of severe disease.

Photograph: Alan Betson The decision to return to an exam-only Leaving Cert is “very disappointing” and “does not put student voices at the centre”, the second level students’ union has said.On Tuesday, Minister for Education Norma Foley announced that this year’s Leaving Cert exams would not have the option for accredited grades and the Junior Cert would return for the first time since 2019.However, she said the Leaving cert would be “tailor-made” in recognition of the challenges faced by students and will have more question options available and less material for students to cover.The move came despite repeated calls from students and the Opposition for another hybrid Leaving Cert, which includes written exams and accredited grades, on the basis that many students have experienced significant disruption to their studies due to the pandemic.Emer Neville, president of the Irish Second Level Students’ Union (ISSU), said there was a “clear mandate” from students that a hybrid approach was the best option.“That mandate was not listened to. Last year, we saw such fantastic engagement from the department with young people, and students really were listened to,” she told The .“But it was made abundantly clear this year that this was different. That’s very disappointing and very frustrating for the students who are going to sit those exams.”Ms Neville said a hybrid approach was preferred because students have been through three years of “heavily disrupted education”.“There are massive discrepancies that we’re seeing throughout student education the whole way across the country. Not every student had access to online tuition, not every student has access to grinds that they can catch up on the work that they’ve missed,” she added.Meanwhile, the Children’s Rights Alliance said it was “concerned” by the news, adding that reverting to traditional exams is a “missed opportunity” for Leaving Cert reform.Tanya Ward, chief executive of the alliance said, the decision “will effectively ignore the voices of many young people”.‘Easiest way out’“ From a children’s rights perspective, this decision does not stand up to scrutiny. We need to do what is best for the young people sitting the exam and not take the easiest way out,” she said.“We have the opportunity to make the changes necessary to avoid a stressful situation for our young people and to ensure that they reach their full potential in education.”Meanwhile, the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) welcomed the certainty provided to students by Tuesday’s announcement, adding that it provides the basis “for fair and equitable outcomes for all students”.The union said that recent speculation on whether the examinations would proceed as normal was “regrettable and avoidable”.“The TUI has consistently made the point that in the absence of full Junior Certificate data for all students, there is simply no viable model for an alternative assessment mechanism that could guarantee fairness and equity for the class of 2022, irrespective of the postcode of their school,” it said in a statement.The TUI added that the additional modifications made to the State exams need to be “communicated in full” so students and teachers can make the most of the remainder of the school year.The Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland (ASTI), said the changes announced for this year’s exams will create a “level playing field” for students.Eamon Dennehy, ASTI president, said the announcement gives certainty to students and increases choice in papers.“Our 2022 Leaving Certificate students have come through extraordinary challenges and much uncertainty over the past two years,” he said.“ It is essential that these students are provided with a Leaving Cert examination which is student-centred and responsive to the challenges they have experienced during the pandemic.”He added: “Students and their teachers can now have the confidence that the exams will be fair and transparent and will take into account the unique circumstances of the Leaving Cert 2022 cohort.”The National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD) also welcomed the additional changes to this year’s exams.Paul Crone, director of the NAPD, said student wellbeing is “fundamental” to the association’s core principles.“This year’s Leaving Certificate students have suffered massive disruption to their education and have missed out on considerable learning opportunities due to the pandemic,” he said.“We will continue to advocate on their behalf to ensure they are treated fairly and appropriately.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"eu commission accused of maladministration by ombudsman over pfizer ceo texts","story":"European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen exchanged text messages with Pfizer chief Albert Bourla to seal a Covid-19 vaccine deal. File photograph: John ThysAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union ombudsman accused the European Commission of maladministration on Friday for not disclosing text messages that the head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, exchanged with Pfizer chief Albert Bourla to seal a Covid-19 vaccine deal.In an interview in April, Ms Von der Leyen revealed she had exchanged texts with Mr Bourla for a month when they were negotiating a vaccine contract for the bloc. But in response to a public access request by a journalist, the commission later said no record had been kept of such messages.“The narrow way in which this public access request was treated meant that no attempt was made to identify if any text messages existed,” said ombudsman Emily O’Reilly.“The ombudsman found that this amounted to maladministration,” the watchdog said in a statement, asking the commission to check again for the relevant messages and to reply to the recommendation by April 26th.“If text messages concern EU policies and decisions, they should be treated as EU documents,” the ombudsman added.A spokesman for the commission later on Friday declined to comment about whether the texts had been cancelled and whether they were exchanged with a private or a professional telephone.He told journalists the EU executive would reply to the ombudsman by the deadline and noted EU rules required the commission to register documents, with no specific requirement to store text messages as long as they were not treated as documents.The ombudsman’s recommendations are not binding, but usually trigger heightened scrutiny from the European Parliament. “The European Commission has become less transparent, less accountable to the European Parliament and frankly more unhinged from European democracy,” said liberal Dutch MEP Sophia In ‘t Veld.The deal negotiated via text messages and calls, according to what Ms Von der Leyen herself said in an interview with the New York Times, was the biggest contract ever sealed for Covid-19 vaccines, with the EU committing to buy 900 million Pfizer-BioNTech shots, with an option to buy another 900 million.When the deal was formally announced in May, the EU had already secured hundreds of millions of vaccines from several drug-makers, including another 600 million doses from Pfizer and BioNTech under two previous contracts with the two companies. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"israel is an apartheid state amnesty report says","story":" Israeli soldiers order Palestinian vendors to close their shops in the old part of the West Bank city of Hebron on Saturday after claims that stones were hurled at Israeli settlers. Photograph: Abed al HashlamounEPAAmnesty International has accused Israel of subjecting Palestinians to a system of apartheid in a decades-long campaign that deprives them of their rights under international law and amounts to a crime against humanity. In a comprehensive report released on Tuesday, Amnesty cites Israeli, Palestinian and international rights activists, groups, organisations and testimony, providing a historical, political, economic and social overview of the explosive situation. In the report entitled Israel’s Apartheid against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime against Humanity, Amnesty documents and analyses “Israel’s institutionalised and systematic discrimination against Palestinians” and its use of “inhuman and inhumane acts” to maintain this system which “amounts to the crime against humanity of apartheid”. It is the second international rights organisation in the last year to accuse Israel of engaging in apartheid after Human Rights Watch did so last April.In the report, Amnesty secretary general Agnes Callamard states: “Governments who continue to supply Israel with arms and shield it from accountability at the UN are supporting a system of apartheid, undermining the international legal order, and exacerbating the suffering of the Palestinian people. The international community must face up to the reality of Israel’s apartheid, and pursue the many avenues to justice which remain shamefully unexplored.”Amnesty says that before Israel’s creation in 1948, Palestinians comprised 70 per cent of the population and owned 90 per cent of privately owned land while Jews were 30 per cent of the population and owned 6.5 per cent. During the 1947-49 conflict, 800,000 of 1.2 million Palestinians were “displaced in what amounted to ethnic cleansing”. The 150,000 who remained were granted citizenship but were placed under military rule until 1966 and have faced dispossession, discrimination and political marginalisation. Since 1948, Amnesty says, “Israel has pursued an explicit policy of establishing and maintaining Jewish demographic hegemony and maximising its control over land to benefit Jewish Israelis while minimising the number of Palestinians and restricting their rights and obstructing their ability to challenge this dispossession.” Israel extended this policy to East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza in 1967 when another 350,000 Palestinians were driven into Jordan, the report says. MethodsThe report lists means which Israel employs to achieve its objectives, including land expropriation, deportation, denial of building permits, home demolitions, movement restrictions, administrative detention and imprisonment, closure of civil society organisations, and separate legal systems for Palestinians and Israeli Jews.Palestinians, Amnesty writes, “overwhelmingly regard themselves as Palestinian and have deep and shared political, ethnic, social and cultural ties” wherever they reside while Israel “considers and treats Palestinians as an inferior non-Jewish racial group”. In its response, the Israeli government rejects “all the false allegations that appear in the report”, claiming it is “biased and based on lies spread by terrorist organisations”. Foreign minister Yair Lapid states: “Amnesty was once an esteemed and respected organisation, Today, it stands for anything BUT human rights. It’s become simply one more radical grouping of uninformed activists that echoes propaganda with no serious examination of the facts.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid became free speech nightmare","story":"When a comedian promises to try harder after an ageing musician complains about their work, it’s rarely – if ever – headline news. Joe Rogan’s mournful Instagram video pledge to “try harder to get people with differing opinions on” his podcast after his “absolutely I get things wrong” mea culpa is possibly unique in the history of popular culture perhaps marking the moment we’ve passed through the looking glass on free speech and Covid.If that wasn’t thorny enough on its own, it comes as questions are being asked about how sensible an approach the BBC will take towards this week’s episode of Question Time, which will feature unvaccinated people in the audience, and as MPs are investigating the tactics of the government’s Nudge Unit after psychologists have questioned its “deploying fear, shame and scapegoating during the pandemic”.It is very difficult to know where to draw the line in discussions about disinformation and official information. If we were to say that all disinformation should be banned from major media sites, who decides? The World Health Organisation? Inidual governments? “It’s very problematic,” explains Martin Bright at Index on Censorship. “The musicians involved are perfectly within their rights to protest – where I become uncomfortable is when an ultimatum is set, forcing Spotify to choose between Joe Rogan and these musicians. As an open society we should, wherever possible, allow even the most uncomfortable debates to happen in as big a public arena as possible.”Since the start of the pandemic, however, there has been a surprising orthodoxy around the right thing to do, spearheaded in the UK by the likes of former Sage guru Neil Ferguson, and UK Health Security Agency chief executive Jenny Harries. Science has never been about unshakeable consensus – scientific theories are called theories for a reason. They are our best guess under the circumstances, but they could prove incorrect should further evidence emerge. The half life of Covid facts – the amount of time it takes before the majority of the knowledge we have is proved false – is uncertain, but from lockdown to masks and vaccines, credible dissenters have found themselves denied access to the airwaves and faced being smeared by the Twitter pundit and mainstream broadcaster alike.Oxford University professor Sunetra Gupta, who is so pro-vax that she’s part of a team that patented a new influenza vaccine a few months ago, knows this better than most. She fell foul of this orthodoxy as one of the primary authors of October 2020’s Great Barrington Declaration, which argued that protecting the vulnerable should replace a strategy of national lockdowns.“There is no moral imperative for consensus,” she says. “It is difficult to dismiss our viewpoint as being outrageous. Lockdowns and non-pharmacological interventions had huge uncertainty – we didn’t know what they would do to the spread of pandemic, but we did know they would cause economic harm to the poor and the young. Since then, the mainstream media and scientific journals have been actively engaged in publishing defamatory articles, saying we’d been bankrolled by the Koch brothers, and refusing us a right of reply. We are not on the BBC whilst the Zero Covid proponents are.”This response, Gupta found, meant that adherents to the wilder Covid theories – those who blame 5G, argue it was a Chinese Communist Party plot, that it was a scheme hatched by George Soros and Bill Gates to defeat Donald Trump, that it’s a Big Pharma plot and that, in fact, it doesn’t exist – ended up pushed into the same camp as an experienced epidemiologist like her. As a result, she found scientists who agreed with her research choosing to remain silent or even asking for their names to be taken off research papers.“It’s sad that we’ve ended up in coalition with some strange bedfellows,” she says. “I think that’s because we’ve lost the ability, as a civilised society, to accept that there is more than just a yesno answer to every question. In 1991 I was part of a team that published a paper on anti retrovirals urging caution – and the general climate was one of tolerance and different opinions being permitted. Today that is no longer the case.”Part of the problem, according to Dr Clare Birchall at King’s College London, who is researching Covid conspiracy theories, is that the general state of polarised debate means contrary views in any public debate are instantly politicised.“Lockdowns have created a coalition of distrust, drawing people together who would not normally share the same protest space,” she explains. “This means that views ranging from mild libertarianism to hardcore conspiracy theories become entwined and hard to disentangle.”Even as evidence for mask use has ided scientific communities, most nations opted to err on the side of caution – so although papers from as far back as 1997 show face masks are poor protectors against influenza, and a 2006 pandemic preparedness plan from the Canadian government did not recommend healthy iniduals use face masks, it has been hard to hear these positions argued in the mainstream media. Ferguson himself has admitted his doomsday predictions had been ‘oversimplified’ and “wrong” but lockdown fans – a curious concept – have not sought de-platforming.“Covid has put a huge strain on our instinct for free speech in this country,” Bright agrees. “Joe Rogan is prepared to have all sorts of conspiracy theorists on his programme – that’s part of his appeal. If you have someone who believes in UFOs or a flat earth, these discussions are harmless. Discussions about an international pandemic are of a different order. It is important to find ways of challenging inaccurate information in the public arena rather than closing all debate down.”As useful illustration of how this can backfire is known as the Streisand effect after the singer’s attempts in 2003 to get a photograph of her house removed from the California Costal Records Project saw downloads jump from six (including two by her lawyers) to 420,000.Some scholars argue that de-platforming doesn’t work, says Birchall “because it directs speakers towards unmoderated alternative online spaces or even private encrypted spaces. Many people say it’s better to have the conversation in the open to balance the risk to public health with the risk to public safety. Equally, we might think there is a problem with handing decisions about free speech to private companies like Facebook.”However deplatforming does, she adds, make it much harder for “conspiracy grifters like Alex Jones to make a living,” referencing the Infowars presenters huckstering of products like “Nano Silver toothpaste” and a “Superblue Silver Immune Gargle” as treatments for Covid.Certainly the gap in the mainstream media has allowed Rogan’s interviews to acquire an importance they don’t deserve – and has allowed celebrities like Russell Brand to take strong positions on the debates in his YouTube show.Rogan is emerging as a voice of reason in this debate – possibly prompted by Spotify’s cratering share price. “I will do my best to try to balance out these more controversial viewpoints with other people’s perspectives so we can maybe find a better point of view,” his statement concluded.Bright believes that the long term picture is positive. “Covid has put a huge strain on our instinct for free speech in this country,” he says. “Because of the pluralism of our media you will find people who are sceptical in some media outlets and other media filled with people signed up to the government’s line. When we look back overall I think we will see that, despite the strains, the discussion of Covid lockdown has been for the most part an open and vibrant debate.”He cites discussions on the BBC about whether locking down students was the right way to proceed - as opposed to putting a ring of security around old people per the Barrington Declaration. In the maelstrom of Covid coverage, however, the brutal treatment of dissent on social media platforms suggests Twitter mobs still have the power to drive, for instance, Gupta away from the platform.Bright acknowledges the tensions but argues things haven’t reached the level of the trans debate or arguments about war crimes in Syria. Then he pauses thoughtfully and adds “I’m not sure if you should quote me but I think we’ve come through this.”More from NewsTony Blair’s ex-fundraiser given jail term for breaching court orders in £2m orce from Austrian princessUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson warns Russia of sanctions as soon as \u0026#39first toe-cap\u0026#39 crosses borderFiery dispute: Dante depicted being sent to burn in hell in 700-year-old fresco, scholars claimEmily Maitlis apologises for sharing tweet attacking Government’s ‘Trumpian shabbiness’Eight ways Sue Gray’s ‘partygate’ report makes things worse for Boris JohnsonBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid britain has let children","story":"More from NewsTony Blair’s ex-fundraiser given jail term for breaching court orders in £2m orce from Austrian princessUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson warns Russia of sanctions as soon as \u0026#39first toe-cap\u0026#39 crosses borderFiery dispute: Dante depicted being sent to burn in hell in 700-year-old fresco, scholars claimEmily Maitlis apologises for sharing tweet attacking Government’s ‘Trumpian shabbiness’Eight ways Sue Gray’s ‘partygate’ report makes things worse for Boris JohnsonBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"does history tell us close boris could voter sell by date","story":"Boris Johnson seems absolutely determined to resist calls for him to step down. He is in good company. British prime ministers – with the exception of Harold Wilson and David Cameron – don’t tend to “go gentle into that good night”, preferring instead to cling on, limpet-like until their party is removed from office at the ballot box or, like Johnson’s immediate predecessor Theresa May, they are effectively forced out by colleagues hoping (not altogether unreasonably, it turns out) that a change of leader may persuade the public to forget their failings and give them a second chance. As post-war political history shows us, even serious ill health hasn’t been enough to prevent previous prime ministers trying hard to bag and then hang on to the top job for as long as they can – although it has, for at least a couple of them, eventually furnished a convenient excuse for bowing out earlier than they might have wished.Winston Churchill, for instance, was already in pretty poor shape by the time he regained the premiership in 1951 at the age of 76, and many of his colleagues – not least his ambitious foreign secretary, Anthony Eden – hoped he would retire after a year or so. But, in spite of an array of medical problems and an increasingly evident decline in his powers, he refused to relinquish the prize. And such was the Conservative Party’s concern not to be seen to be ditching the country’s iconic wartime leader that, even after he suffered a massive stroke in June 1953 that left him incapacitated for months, his colleagues connived in keeping the full story from the public.Things might have been different for Churchill had Eden, ironically enough, not been ill himself as the result of a botched operation earlier that year. So serious were its consequences, in fact, that by the time Churchill was prevailed upon to reluctantly call it a day in the spring of 1955, Eden, too, was already long past his best. Even though his premiership got off to a superb start – he called an election almost immediately after taking over and increased the Tories’ overall majority from 17 to 60 – he was soon driving his ministers to distraction with what many of them regarded as his unwarranted interference in the running of their departments.Naturally, their irritation pales into insignificance with the cause of Eden’s eventual departure in early 1957 – his responsibility for the doomed attempt to snatch back the Suez Canal in the autumn of 1956 and the knowledge among his colleagues that he had misled Parliament in denying any collusion with Israel and France in the build-up to the operation.The episode emphasises the role (one reprised half a century later under Tony Blair) that a major miscalculation in foreign and military affairs can play in bringing down a premiership, especially when combined with a prime minister being seen to have been less than honest with the public on the issue. But it also risks blinding us to the equally important role played by far more mundane domestic considerations.Because Suez looms so large in the story of Eden’s undoing, we forget that soon after the election, his chancellor, Rab Butler was forced to introduce a humiliating emergency budget just months after he had helped win the 1955 election with something of a giveaway before it. We forget, too, that – partly as a result – less than a year into his premiership Eden was being called on (by a disappointed Daily , no less) to demonstrate “the smack of firm government”.Indeed, it was those domestic difficulties, even though they weren’t reflected in a particularly significant loss of support in the polls (which came out far less frequently in those days anyway), that led Eden to reshuffle both Butler and Macmillan, much to the chagrin of both – one reason, along with their transparent desire to succeed him, why they did little or nothing to help their boss out over Suez and its aftermath.In the event, it was the 62-year-old Macmillan who, after Eden resigned (not altogether unreasonably) pleading ill health, “emerged” as his replacement following “soundings” of the parliamentary party taken by senior Conservatives. And like Eden, he began well, turning things around after Suez and aligning the political and economic cycle to ensure that voters had “never had it so good”, resulting not only in a third consecutive election victory for the Tories at the general election of 1959 but yet another substantial increase in their Commons majority.Again, however, a combination of economic difficulties at home and policy controversy abroad (not least his embrace of the end of empire and his failed attempt to join the EEC), soon saw his government run into trouble. Moreover, the sharp increase in the commissioning of opinion polls made its unpopularity even more glaringly obvious for all to see, as did a series of stunning by-election reverses – probably the first time, but by no means the last time, that such defeats would play a role in putting a premature end to a premiership.The same can be said for another key factor in Macmillan’s early departure (which, like Eden’s, was officially put down to ill health) – namely the appearance of an opposition leader who appears more in touch with the public’s mood and priorities and who they can imagine standing on the steps of No 10. The Profumo affair in 1963, along with 1962’s infamous Night of the Long Knives, during which a panicky Macmillan sacked half his Cabinet, may have confirmed voters’ suspicions that he was past it. But Wilson did a fair bit to help them toward that conclusion.Whether Labour’s Neil Kinnock played as big a role in Margaret Thatcher’s departure in November 1990 is rather more doubtful. But, in truth, he didn’t really need to. All the other elements were there: major policy failures and controversies (the Poll Tax and Europe) economic difficulties (the return of inflation worries) alienated, ambitious and seriously worried colleagues (Howe, Heseltine and Major) the party’s declining support revealed in poll after poll and dramatised by one or two spectacular by-election defeats (most obviously Eastbourne) an obvious waning (possibly due to incipient illness) of the premier’s powers and a sense, overall, that they had done the job the party had needed them to do and that, since they were no longer trusted by voters and had gone from being an electoral asset to an electoral liability, it was time to spin the wheel and move on.A look at that list – and at the history books more generally – should surely worry Johnson, especially now that Labour (probably for the first time since Blair) can boast a leader of the opposition who, for all his lack of charisma, probably passes the proverbial ‘blink test’ as a potential prime minister. Just as they were under Theresa May, most, if not all, of the criteria for an early exit would appear to be met. And if Johnson does eventually go, then, unlike some of his predecessors, the current occupant of No 10 won’t be able to plead infirmity – except, his critics would say, moral infirmity – as even the flimsiest of excuses. Tim Bale is professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of LondonMore from NewsTony Blair’s ex-fundraiser given jail term for breaching court orders in £2m orce from Austrian princessUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson warns Russia of sanctions as soon as \u0026#39first toe-cap\u0026#39 crosses borderFiery dispute: Dante depicted being sent to burn in hell in 700-year-old fresco, scholars claimEmily Maitlis apologises for sharing tweet attacking Government’s ‘Trumpian shabbiness’Eight ways Sue Gray’s ‘partygate’ report makes things worse for Boris JohnsonBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"judge requests prince andrews former assistant testify civil","story":"The Judge presiding over the civil suit brought against the Duke of York has requested that the Prince’s former assistant, Robert Olney, give evidence.Prince Andrew is being sued by Virginia Giuffre, claiming she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with the Duke when she was 17 years old. The Duke of York denies all the allegations against him.Judge Lewis A Kaplan has written to the Senior Master of the Queen\u0027s Bench Division in an effort to get Mr Olney to testify regarding communication between Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epsiten, Ghislaine Maxwell and Ms Giuffre as well as his travel to Epstein’s various properties.Last month, Ms Giuffre’s lawyers had requested Mr Olney’s testimony as well as one potential witness based in Britain.Judge Kaplan also wrote to the High Court requesting to hear the testimony of Shukri Walker, a UK based woman who claims to have seen the Duke and Ms Giuffre in Tramp nightclub in London in March 2001.Ms Giuffre’s husband Robert and her psychologist Dr Judith Lightfoot have also been asked to provide testimony.For his part, Mr Giuffre will be asked to discuss how he met his wife, any childhood trauma suffered, her relationship with Epstein and Maxwell as well as any occasions on which she mentioned the Duke of York.Dr Lightfoot will be asked to discuss any medical interactions she has had with Ms Giuffre as well as the theory of false memory.All four witnesses have been asked to finish giving testimony by April 29.More from NewsTony Blair’s ex-fundraiser given jail term for breaching court orders in £2m orce from Austrian princessUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson warns Russia of sanctions as soon as \u0026#39first toe-cap\u0026#39 crosses borderFiery dispute: Dante depicted being sent to burn in hell in 700-year-old fresco, scholars claimEmily Maitlis apologises for sharing tweet attacking Government’s ‘Trumpian shabbiness’Eight ways Sue Gray’s ‘partygate’ report makes things worse for Boris JohnsonBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer has overplayed hand","story":"Boris Johnson is not out of the woods yet. But to his critics’ fury, he looks like he may at least have secured another extension of his time at Number 10, and events – including the Met’s investigation of Downing Street’s social calendar during lockdown – will decide how long that stay of execution will be.Perhaps one weakness in the opposition’s strategy so far has been its tendency to demand resignations, not as the last resort, but as the first one. The Labour leadership started calling for Johnson’s resignation long before he even became Prime Minister. In 2017, after a disastrous blunder in front of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Foreign Secretary Johnson wrongly claimed that British citizen, Nazanin Zaghari-Radcliffe, imprisoned in Iran, had been in the country to train journalists (she had in fact been on holiday visiting relatives).It was a dreadful error and Ms Zaghari-Radcliffe may well have spent longer in captivity as a result. Johnson’s resignation was immediately demanded by the then Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, London mayor Sadiq Khan and the then Shadow Foreign Secretary, Emily Thornberry. Whether such calls were justified is beside the point: when your very first response is to demand an opponent loses his or her job, you’ve no weapons left in your armoury after the first attack is repelled.Ian Blackford of the SNP is a perfect example of self-righteous anger reducing in effectiveness the more it’s deployed. Perhaps he thought he was being radical and rebellious by accusing the prime minister of lying during yesterday’s statement on the Sue Gray report. Perhaps he sees himself as an edgy man of the people, willing to stick it to The Man without fear or favour. But to those of us who pay attention to such things, it was just another identikit performance of the sort we’re used to enduring. Every week at Prime Minister’s Questions, and at every other opportunity too, he begins each indignant contribution in top gear, with nowhere to go after that. Choosing to be expelled from the chamber for his own misbehaviour is a tactic that many MPs have used over the years, but Blackford probably felt he had no choice but to try it out, since his outraged bluster was having no impact whatsoever on the House. Because they’d heard it all before. Many times.Labour has a similar problem. Right from the start, when it was demanding Johnson’s resignation as Foreign Secretary, and throughout the Brexit Wars at the end of the Tantrum Parliament in the autumn of 2019, it made perfectly clear that it believed Johnson was unfit for office. Whether because of his alleged racism in newspaper columns or his promise during the EU referendum of a £350 million weekly Brexit bonus for the NHS, this is a Prime Minister who evokes a personal hatred among his opponents that not even Margaret Thatcher could have matched.Put it another way: which Labour MPs who are using every opportunity to use the phrase “unfit for office” and “resign” today have changed their minds on Johnson’s suitability for the job? Are there legions of Labour MPs who, until last November, thought he was up to the job and have only now, perhaps reluctantly, come to the conclusion that he must go?Given that we all know the answer to that question, we must conclude that Partygate is merely the latest opportunity for the opposition to engineer an end to which they have always been committed. Had Labour kept at least a little outrage in reserve over the past couple of years, then their maximum volume, screeching denunciations now would have been all the more effective.In days gone by, Leaders of the Opposition would reach for the button marked ‘vote of confidence’ only reluctantly. Only when it looked like a leader was about to be, or actually had been, deposed, would such a tool be used. Similarly, demanding a Prime Minister resign has, until recently, been a tactic that was all the more powerful for the fact that it was so rarely used.It\u0027s been self-defeating also for shadow ministers to use the term “liar” about Johnson so frequently (but only when they are safely out of Mr Speaker’s jurisdiction, of course). For a start, there are many voters who, even if they agree with the charge, disapprove of unparliamentary language, even if it’s used in a TV studio rather than in the House of Commons. Why alienate those voters unnecessarily by resorting to abusive terms when alternative, softer spoken criticisms would have the same, or even greater, impact?Keir Starmer and his lieutenants could usefully learn from the approach of the Shadow Chief Secretary, Pat McFadden, one of the most effective shadow cabinet members. Appearing on the wireless this morning, he presented the most devastating indictment of Johnson I’ve yet heard, and did so in his trademark polite, quiet, methodical, calm tones. He was all the more effective for the contrast his performance drew with many of his more excitable (and louder) colleagues.The first rule of journalism I was taught was: “Dog bites man is not a news story man bites dog – that’s a story.”“Opposition calls for Prime Minister to resign” was once a news story. No longer. And that is a problem for the Labour Party.More from NewsTony Blair’s ex-fundraiser given jail term for breaching court orders in £2m orce from Austrian princessUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson warns Russia of sanctions as soon as \u0026#39first toe-cap\u0026#39 crosses borderFiery dispute: Dante depicted being sent to burn in hell in 700-year-old fresco, scholars claimEmily Maitlis apologises for sharing tweet attacking Government’s ‘Trumpian shabbiness’Eight ways Sue Gray’s ‘partygate’ report makes things worse for Boris JohnsonBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"paper stamps licked royal mail gives post digital upgrade","story":"Sending a letter in the post can seem a rather plodding, outdated means of communication these days.But the humble stamp, as we know it, is to be phased out and replaced with a version designed to bring the process into the digital age.Barcodes are to be attached to regular first and second class stamps, marking the biggest shake-up to the way post is handled in almost 200 years.They will allow recipients to watch videos and eventually access messages and even choose their own greetings.The inaugural “video stamp”, featuring an exclusive Aardman animation of Shaun the Sheep, goes on sale on Tuesday.It is the first in a series of videos to be released throughout the year, allowing customers to choose which they would like their recipient to see when they receive an item of mail.Nick Landon, chief commercial officer at Royal Mail, said the initiative had allowed them to “connect the physical letter with the digital world”.A spokesman added: “This is only the start of a new era for the postage stamp.“We want people to continue to experience the pleasure of receiving letters and cards from loved ones, and will continue to work to ensure that stamps remain relevant to future generations.”Royal Mail said the introduction of barcodes would pave the way for further services and innovations. This could include customers being able to scan a stamp with their smartphone and being redirected to a website with more information about a company.It will also enable the introduction of added security features.Each unique barcode will have a “digital twin” and the two will be connected by the Royal Mail app.It matches the colour of the adjoining stamp, from which it is separated by a simulated perforation line.Non-barcoded stamps will be phased out but will remain usable until Jan 31, 2023.The firm is encouraging customers to use up their existing stamps but they will be able to swap any old ones with the new barcoded versions from March 31 via a Freepost address.At the time, Mr Landon compared the change to the introduction of the Penny Black stamp in May 1840, noting that the company had a “long and proud history of creating innovative and intuitive postal solutions”.The initiative was described as part of Royal Mail\u0027s modernisation drive to boost convenience and reflected the rise of internet shopping.But the move might not be everyone’s cup of tea.The Handwritten Letter Appreciation Society wrote on Twitter: “Is it irony that when I write letters I don\u0027t really want to be reminded of the digital world?”Traditionalists can take comfort from the fact that there are absolutely no plans to phase out the famed stamp featuring the head of the monarch.The new stamps will still be available in books and will remain at the same price.The development comes at a turbulent time for Royal Mail, which could be fined millions of pounds by Ofcom over long delays faced by customers.Letter and parcel deliveries have been subject to unprecedented delays as the organisation struggles with staff absence, demand for Covid tests and a deluge of Christmas returns.Deliveries that should take between one and two days are not arriving for weeks, with delays over one week reported in 80 postcodes in January. The company has blamed staff absences.Shadow minister Sarah Jones said she had written to Royal Mail asking it to investigate the current state of affairs following numerous complaints from constituents.More from NewsTony Blair’s ex-fundraiser given jail term for breaching court orders in £2m orce from Austrian princessUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson warns Russia of sanctions as soon as \u0026#39first toe-cap\u0026#39 crosses borderFiery dispute: Dante depicted being sent to burn in hell in 700-year-old fresco, scholars claimEmily Maitlis apologises for sharing tweet attacking Government’s ‘Trumpian shabbiness’Eight ways Sue Gray’s ‘partygate’ report makes things worse for Boris JohnsonBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings has been told","story":"Dominic Cummings has been told there are photos of party in Boris Johnsons flatThe PMs former top advisor claims there are photos of Boris Johnson at events that are under investigation by police - and says he has been told that there are photos of a party in his Downing Street flat Image: Getty ImagesByMikey SmithWhitehall Correspondent:,  Feb |commentsDominic Cummings has been told there are photographs of a party in Boris Johnsonaposs Downing Street flat - and more pictures which will incriminate the Prime Minister.The Prime Ministeraposs former chief aide has alleged there are photographs of Boris Johnson at reported gatherings under investigation by police.

He said Ms Truss was little known and had said a lot of stuff that will not be popular with members  when they hear it. If she gets to the last , the combination of her support for Remain and her record will be big problems for her. Her chances are probably being overrated, he said.He said he thought Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove probably will run again, while on Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, he said: He has never been in Cabinet and it is hard to imagine Tory MPs promoting someone straight to the top job who has not been in Cabinet.He said: RS is obviously the front runner cos heaposs way ahead in the polls and unlike Truss Hunt TT was pro-Brexit. His team conceived and executed furlough in very tough circumstances, and which was one of most popular things a politician has done in a very long time. That will be a big strength when the contest comes. He went on to tell Tory MPs there was no excuse for self-delusions about Boris Johnson. At this point the blame lies mostly with the Tory MPs, he wrote. Heaposs obviously totally unfit for the job and every day heaposs left their moral authority drops another notch. But he added: Thereaposs lots of blame to go around beyond them, including people in no who have also shown a distinct lack of moral courage...

His apology was met with scorn by Labours Keir StarmerKeir Starmers speech was met with a controversial response from a PM branded desperate Image: PAByBenjamin LynchTrends Writer:,  Feb |comments Under-fire Prime Minister Boris Johnso n faced a damning speech from Keir Starmer in the House of Commons on Monday. The leader of the Labour Party said that the desperate Prime Minster gleefully treats what should be a mark of shame as a welcome shield. Johnson has faced repeated calls to resign from both opposition and his own benches in Parliament, amid fury at the Partygate scandals at Number . He even faced a withering question from former PM Theresa May. The alleged parties, some of which are also under investigation by the politan Police, were subjected to a report by civil servant Sue Gray.Gray has been tasked with pulling together testimony and evidence about parties at Downing Street during lockdown. The full report with details has not been released. Gray was forced to publish the first part without any inclusion of evidence as the police probe is still ongoing.The publication of the update led to Johnson addressing the findings with an apology, but he also resorted to accusations against the opposition leader.Where can I watch Keir Starmeraposs speech  Starmeraposs speech to the House of Commons in response to the Prime Ministeraposs statement on the Sue Gray report can be viewed on The Mirroraposs YouTube channel here. The PM also suggested with with no evidence that the Labour frontbench were on drugs.A full account of the proceedings, including the PMaposs statement, the controversial accusation about Jimmy Saville made by Boris Johnson and the response from MPs, can be seen on the BBC iPlayer here.After the Prime Ministeraposs statement, the opposition leaderaposs reply starts just after the six-minute mark. What did Keir Starmer say to Boris Johnson   The PM apologised for the findings of the report, telling the House: I get it and I will fix it. Itaposs no use saying this or that was within the rules and itaposs no use saying people were working hard. This pandemic was hard for everyone, he added. In response, Starmer said: Funerals have been missed, dying relatives have been unvisited. Every family has been marred by what we have been through. And revelations about the Prime Minister’s behaviour have forced us all to rethink and relive those darkest moments. Many have been overcome by rage, by grief and even by guilt.  Whatever people’s politics, whatever party they vote for, honesty and decency matter. Our great democracy depends on them. Cherishing and nurturing British democracy is what it means to be patriotic. There are Conservative members who know that, and they know that the Prime Minister is incapable of it.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford was kicked out of the chamber as he refused to withdraw his claim that Johnson had knowingly lied to the house.What did Sue Grayaposs report say   The full report has not yet been published, but the update criticised failures of leadership and judgement in  Downing Street. Gray revealed that police are looking into  gatherings.

Some .% have received a second jab, after the rules changed last month to offer the age group a second dose. Vaccination rates were better in older teenagers, as .% of  to -year-olds having received one jab, and % getting a second over the same period. Worrying figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed that  to -year-olds from poorer areas were less likely to get jabbed than their wealthier peers. Pupils eligible for free school meals had lower uptake than more affluent children. Only .% of youngsters eligible for the benefit were vaccinated, compared to .%  Children living in the % most deprived areas of England the vaccination rate was .%, compared with .% in the % least deprived areas. London had the lowest level of vaccine uptake in this age group with .% of pupils vaccinated, compared with .% in the South East. The data showed that pupils from Chinese and Indian backgrounds were most likely to have received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine, with .% of Chinese pupils and .% of Indian pupils aged  to  having received at least a first dose. Gypsy or Roma and Black Caribbean pupils were least likely to have been vaccinated, with .% of both groups having been vaccinated. Although this is in part related to dferent levels of deprivation, large dferences in the likelihood of being vaccinated by ethnic group still exist after accounting for available deprivation measures, the ONS said. It comes as attendance data last week showed .% of all pupils were off school because of Covid on January , up from .% on January  - a record high for this school year, with , pupils absent in total. Shadow Schools Minister Stephen Morgan said: “Ministers have failed to tackle the postcode lottery in children’s vaccinations which Labour has highlighted for months, which risks cementing existing inequalities.“Vaccines are key to keeping children in class learning together, yet more than % of  –  year olds still haven’t had a first dose and vaccination rates are falling. “The government must redouble its efforts to drive-up vaccination rates, including delivering targeted communications campaigns and school exclusion zones to prevent anti-vaxxers spreading dangerous disinformation.” Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders , said the initial rollout had been reasonably successful but raised concerns about patchy provision. The signicant regional iations in the number of students vaccinated are concerning and it is dficult to overlook that the areas with the lowest uptake - London and the North West - were hotspots for very high levels of student and staff absence at the end of the autumn term, a pattern that has largely continued during the first few weeks of the new year, she said. Even more worrying is the low uptake of vaccinations among pupils eligible for free school meals and in the most disadvantaged areas of England, as well as among students who speak English as an additional language and those with special educational needs . These are the students who can least afford more time out of school.Secondary schools were handed £million in NHS funding to bolster their on-site jabs programmes last month. Announcing the cash, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: My message remains the same as ever – testing, ventilation and vaccinations are our best weapons against the virus – keep testing, and get your vaccination as soon as possible.”It comes as over s will be able to use the NHS Covid pass to prove their vaccination status from February , in a boost to families planning half term getaways.

The Chancellor has been locked in talks on how to help families ahead of Ofgem announcing April’s energy price cap next Monday. But pressed repeatedly to announce a plan today, he replied: “We continue to look at all the policies we have in place.”He highlighted existing schemes, a .% minimum wage rise and changes to the Universal Credit taper rate, saying: “I am of course aware of people’s anxiety.”Experts have warned average energy bills could rise by £ a year when the price cap is changed on April . In the same week, National Insurance will rise from % to .%, the student loans repayment threshold will freeze, and inflation is set to hit grocery bills. Yet Mr Sunak and Boris Johnson have already pledged not to U-turn over the National Insurance rise despite Tory pressure.They are expected to announce a plan to tackle energy bills, but it’s understood it cannot be guaranteed this week. Reports over the weekend claimed the plan had been delayed due to the chaos in No over the Sue Gray report.In a worried Commons debate, Labour MP Paul Blomfield told the Chancellor one constituent’s bills were going from £ to £ a month, “eating up another % of her take home pay”.Tory ex-minister Stephen Crabb said one couple in his seat would see their fixed tarf “more than double”, and “they are going to really struggle this year to pay their energy costs”. He urged the Chancellor to extend the £-a-year Warm Home Discount Scheme - which Mr Sunak did not rule out.  Shadow Treasury Minister Pat McFadden said the PM and Chancellor had “nailed themselves to the mast” over the National Insurance rise adding: “Like Thelma and Louise, they’ve held hands and they’re about to drive off a clf”.Treasury minister Simon Clarke claimed there is “no other responsible way” to pay for NHS improvements. He added: “The six million lowest-paid will pay no extra tax at all as a result of the levy.”But Mr McFadden said: “Voters are being hit by a triple whammy on the cost of living - soaring energy bills, the Chancellor’s own tax rises, and falling real wages. “Next week the energy price cap could rise by as much as £. “Labour has set out a fully costed plan to cut these bills funded by the windfall levy on the oil and gas companies making the most money from the current spike in prices. “Where is the government’s plan for these energy costs - and what is it that has distracted them from producing one ” SNP MP Alison Thewliss said: “This is a cost of living crisis, yet today is the first time this Chancellor has been to this house since the start of December and we still don’t hear a plan from him.“Too distracted by plotting for the Prime Minister’s job to help those affected by this crisis.” Labour’s Ian Lavery warned elderly people were “freezing in their homes” and “more people than ever using food banks”. Meanwhile, Labour blasted the £.billion written off by the Treasury over Covid fraud. In a written answer shown to the Mirror, Treasury ministers admitted they could not say how many frauds on the Bounce Back Loan Scheme ended up in court.Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves quoted Treasury minister Lord Agnew, who resigned slamming “schoolboy errors” and “a combination of arrogance, indolence and ignorance”.Treasury minister Simon Clarke insisted the government would “go after every penny” taken fraudulently - and stricter rules on the schemes would have seen “thousands of companies closing”. He said: “We rightly placed emphasis on speed when creating those schemes but we will robustly pursue anyone who’s taken advantage of the Exchequer.” But Ms Reeves blasted: “£.bn written off as a result of the Chancellor’s fraud failures. A thousand loans to companies that weren’t even trading at the start of the pandemic. “£, awarded to a person with  criminal convictions. £, to a drugs gang. “Is the Chancellor really saying examples like this strike the right balance ” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Rishi Sunak\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Treasury insiders denied that Mr Johnson had set a precedent that other ministers should follow.  They said Mr Sunak had felt it was important to be visible and supportive of the Government on the day Sue Gray published an update of her report. The Chancellor later attended a crowded meeting of the Toriesapos backbench  committee in a show of solidarity with his beleaguered boss. And he led Treasury questions in the House of Commons chamber on Tuesday. Mr Sunak, who was one of the only ministers wearing a facemask on the frontbench, tested negative before the Commons statement.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, sitting on Ms Patelaposs other side, later tested positive for Covid and was forced to miss her trip to the Ukraine with the PM.

The advice adds that people should work from homeyou are able to and wear a face-covering in crowded places. A spokesman for Mr Sunak said: The Chancellor has followed the legal requirements to the letter. “He has taken daily lateral flow tests and has limited his social contact where possible, whilst also ensuring that he is able to continue to conduct important Government and Parliamentary business as the public would expect.  Just last month, No  announced Mr Johnson was unlikely to be seen in public for a week after a member of his immediate family, later revealed to be baby Romy, tested positive for Covid. The PMaposs official spokesman said he would heed official guidance to limit outside contacts as much as possible for seven days after the test. “In line with the guidance, he’s reducing contact, he told reporters. He’ll be working from No , doing daily tests and limiting contact with others both outside No  and indeed inside No  as well, having limited contact with others in the building, and conducting meetings online.” However, Mr Johnson faced accusations he was hiding behind the illness, as it came while he faced intense scrutiny over his attendance at a BYOB garden party in No  during lockdown. The PM cancelled a visit to a vaccination centre in Lancashire, where he would have faced tough media questions, while a Downing Street press conference was also axed.

This blows apart Downing Street’s original defence there were no parties and the guidance was followed at all times.  Gray reveals the police are investigating  of these parties including a gathering in the Prime Minister’s private flat on November ,  and the Birthday Party for Mr Johnson on June , . This leaves open the possibility his we Carrie could be dragged into the police investigation. Johnson is also accused of misleading Parliament after he denied in the Commons on December  last year that a party had taken place on November  .  Here is what  Sue Gray said in her report… and what it really means: What the Gray report said:“We carried out interviews of over  iniduals, some more than once, and examined relevant documentary and digital information, such as emails Whatsapp messages text messages photographs and building entry and exit logs. This has also included searches of official records.” What it means:All of this information has been handed to the police who are investigating whether the parties broke lockdown rules. Scotland Yard today said it had been given more than  photos as part of the evidence compiled by Gray. If any of the pictures feature Johnson it could prove he was partying while the rest of the country was told to follow lockdown rules. Evenhe is cleared by the police, these images could see him damned in the court of public opinion.  What the Gray report said: “It is not for me to make a judgment on whether the criminal law has been broken that is properly a matter for law enforcement.” She later writes that because of the police investigation: “I have not made comment on whether inidual gatherings were in line with the relevant guidance and regulations in place at the time.”What it means:These were the only lines that proved helpful to Johnson. In his Commons statement, he hid behind these words to claim Gray had not reached a definitive conclusion and to urge MPs to wait until the police investigation. The Prime Minister is trying to buy time in the hope that public anger will have subsided when the police conclude their inquiries.  What the Gray report said: “The hardship under which citizens across the country worked, lived and sadly even died while observing the Government’s regulations and guidance rigorously are known only too well. Those challenges, however, also applied to key and frontline workers across the country who were working under equally,not more, demanding conditions, often at risk to their own health.”What it means:This blows apart the defence used by No  and some Tory MPs to excuse the parties. They had tried to claim that Downing Street was a unique building and its layout meant that work and downtime often collided. Supportive MPs said that staff and officials deserved a chance to unwind after working so hard during the pandemic. Gray does not buy this excuse. What the Gray report said: “Against the backdrop of the pandemic, when the Government was asking citizens to accept far-reaching restrictions on their lives, some of the behaviour surrounding these gatherings is dficult to justy. “At least some of the gatherings in question represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of Government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.What it means:This is as close as Gray gets to delivering a guilty verdict. The “serious” failure to “observe high standards” suggests that Covid rules were broken by the occupants of No  and there was no justication for what took place. Her comments demolish Downing Street’s claim that the guidance was followed at all times.  What the Gray report said: “At times it seems there was too little thought given to what was happening across the country in considering the appropriateness of some of these gatherings, the risks they presented to public health and how they might appear to the public. “There were failures of leadership and judgment by dferent parts of No  and the Cabinet Office at dferent times. Some of the events should not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did.”What it means:This is the most damning part of the report. The criticism of the failure of leadership is a direct rebuke of Johnson. The fact that Gray concludes the events should not have been allowed to take place suggests they were against the law. The line “events should not have been allowed to develop as they did” reads like an admonishment of Johnson for failing to stop the parties and undermines his claim that nobody had told him the “bring you own booze” party might have been against the rules. What the Gray report said: “As a result of the politan Police’s investigations, and so as not to prejudice the police investigative process, they have told me that it would only be appropriate to make minimal reference to the gatherings on the dates they are investigating. “Unfortunately, this necessarily means that I am extremely limited in what I can say about those events and it is not possible at present to provide a meaningful report setting out and analysing the extensive factual information I have been able to gather.”What it means:Gray reveals she has uncovered far more than she is able to publish. As a result we do not know the names of the iniduals who attended the parties or whether they included the Prime Minister and people from outside Downing Street. We also don’t knowher final report will include photos and internal emails and WhatsApp messages. Johnson initially refused to commit to publishing the full Gray report once the police have finished their inquiries only to backtrack later. There will be a reason why he was so reluctant for the truth to come out.  What the Gray report said: “The excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional workplace at any time. “Steps must be taken to ensure that every Government Department has a clear and robust policy in place covering the consumption of alcohol in the workplace.”What it means:Johnson has repeatedly claimed that he and No  staff were doing everything the could to help the country through the pandemic. Gray shows how that during this crucial time there was a drinking culture in Downing Street that had clearly got out of hand. Her comments again point to Johnson’s chaotic and free-wheeling approach to the job.  What the Gray report said: “Some staff wanted to raise concerns about behaviours they witnessed at work but at times felt unable to do so. “No member of staff should feel unable to report or challenge poor conduct where they witness it. There should be easier ways for staff to raise such concerns informally, outside of the line management chain.”What it means:Gray alludes to the fact that some people in No  did realise that the partying was inappropriate and possibly against the law. Her words suggest that they were too scared to speak up because of an intimidatory culture in No . This is will be seen as poor reflection of Johnson’s management at a time when he has been accused by a Tory MP of using ‘blackmail’ to get people to do his bidding.

Mr Aldous said the Prime Minister should resign as its in the best interests of the country.Peter Aldous has become the latest Tory MP to publicly call on Boris Johnson to resign Image: PAByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Feb |commentsThe tenth Tory MP has publicly called for Boris Johnson to resign in the best interests of the country as the Prime Minister continues to battle to save his premiership. Peter Aldous, who has represented the Suffolk constituency since , said he has come to the decision after a great deal of soul-searching. Mr Aldous has sent a letter of no confidence to the  Committee. Mr Johnson faced this call to quit as he travelled to Ukraine to hold crisis talks on how the UK will bolster the nationaposs defence against potential Russian aggression. In the Commons yesterday, Tory grandee Andrew Mitchell told the PM he no longer enjoys my support. Expressing his concerns, Mr Aldous said on Twitter : After a great deal of soul-searching, I have reached the conclusion that the Prime Minister should resign. It is clear that he has no intention of doing so and I have therefore written to the Chairman of the  Committee of Backbench Conservative MPs, advising him that. have no confidence in the Prime Minister as Leader of the Conservative Party.I have never taken such action before and had hoped that I would not be put in such an invidious position. Whilst I am conscious that others will disagree with me, I believe that this is in the best interests of the country, the Government and the Conservative Party. When askedthe PM was worried about another Tory MP calling for his resignation, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: “You have seen the Prime Minister seek to address the concerns of MPs in the House for a number of hours yesterday, so I can point you back to those comments. “Obviously at the moment he is in Ukraine, focused on the challenges there.”It comes as Downing Street made a dramatic U-turn and confirmed they will revealthe PM has been given a fine for breaching lockdown rules.Previously Number  refused to commit to telling the publicthe PM was given a fixed penalty notice.

It isnt Image: Getty ImagesopinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsWell. The Prime Minister is under direct criminal investigation. The evidence of his alleged crimes are being kept hidden from him for fear of interference.And with war brewing on Europeaposs eastern flank, the PM told the enemy he didnapost have time to ring, because he had too much arse-covering to do.The Conservative Party is like an abused we with no other home to go to, and in two minds, not about whether this is acceptable, but whether itaposs survivable. And like every victim, it has yet to realisethataposs the question, then itaposs time to go.  Yesterday, a report he resisted ordering was not published. Instead, there was an aposupdateapos on the alleged criminality of his office, his staff, and his personal residence, and the PM greeted it in the same way he has every Mirror front page, ITV broadcast, and BBC breaking news update since late November: a burst of surprise and contrition with a half-le of . seconds, decaying into toxic belligerence that will linger in the bone for a thousand years. Events for which there was not enough evidence to merit an investigation by the politan Police had, in the space of a month, uncovered  witnesses,  photographs, and  pieces of paper.Despite the insufficient evidence,  out of  parties, on  dates, have met the evidential threshold for an investigation, on the grounds that those involved knew they were against the rules, there was no reasonable justication for them, and not looking into it would end Cressida Dickaposs career quicker than sending the riot squad into a candlelit vigil.One of them is an alleged gathering in the Downing Street flat on November , , which Mrs Johnsonaposs personal spokeswoman has repeatedly insisted is total nonsense, but about which there seems to be enough evidence to merit weeks of attention by an entire squad of coppers.  While the -page report has been subbed down to just , it contains all the facts needed to decide the PMaposs future. Extensive, substantive, factual information is now available, wrote Sue Gray. There were failures of leadership and judgement. There was excessive consumption of alcohol. There was no way for those working in government to stop it breaking the law. There was a serious failure to observe, not just the standards expected of those working at the heart of government, but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.The killer line is in paragraph . The excuse of long hours worked in the pandemic, in a building that could not be entirely Covid-secure, was destroyed. Those challenges... also applied to key and frontline workers across the country who were working under equally,not more, demanding conditions, often at risk to their own health... criminal sanctions were applied to many... the hardship under which citizens across the country worked, lived and sadly even died while observing the Governmentaposs regulations and guidance are known only too well. Every citizen has been impacted by the pandemic. One of them is Leshie Chandrapala. Her dad drove a bus. He died of Covid, and Leshie was not allowed to be with him as he lay in a coma in ICU. She believes he died because he didnapost get PPE at work, but the government hasnapost even written a letter of condolence to her family. A fortnight after he died, and while she grieved, they threw the BYO booze Downing Street garden party. The PMaposs response to the report was to say sorry for the way itaposs been handled, not sorry for doing it. And he has a solution. I know what the issue is, he declared. I get it, and I will fix it! He says he is taking personal charge, and setting up the Office of the Prime Minister. So who was in charge of his office for the past three years  Where is the drunken boozehound who careered around Downing Street Friday night drinkathons, encouraging staffers to let off steam with a long chug on the vodka bottle  Who allowed the culture of recklessness and lawlessness, at the heart of a government that was criminalising the same sins in others  Which leader has led his party to a disgrace worse than Windrush or Grenfell or Orgreave Bring me his head! bellows Boris from the Despatch Box. I will slay this beast, the same way that I would have slain Jimmy Savile,only I didnapost think that investigating historical sex abuse was money spaffed up the wall!Other things he has taken personal control of include Brexit, social care, test and trace, the energy crisis, the ministerial code of conduct, the saving of Owen Paterson, and funding for his gold wallpaper. The fact he took personal control of the vaccines may have something to do with the fact that  million people donapost want them. How many times has he taken charge, only for things to spin out of control  How many times has he shaken up the civil service, only to be rattled himself  Read more The nation is now watching the Conservative Party the same way as the rest of the street watches a victim get out of the police car, andto their abuser. They drag with them a whole country into this deranged, gnarled, unhappy misgovernment, back to the man who wonapost promise to publish the full truth in the House of Commons, where he might be held in contempthe failed to, but will promise it in the bar, to the MPs he has lied to for years, and who have been brainwashed into thinking such a promise is a concession rather than a repetition.Meanwhile the PM only appears in public when the public can be kept away from him. Abba tribute bands are raising their prices for satin satire. Andyou want a three-word slogan to describe where we are, it is simply: another fine mess. The PM or his we may get a fixed penalty notice pictures may or may not emerge. He may be out on his ear, or he may convince enough MPs to give him one more go. Itaposs irrelevant, because the fallout of this radioactive scandal will last to the ballot box and beyond it reaches into homes and hearts, to the guts and spines of millions to whom the words aposToryapos and aposPartyapos are now as repugnant as the fact that people like Leshie had their pain doubled and then dismissed by a man whose charm has long since been spent. The Tories got drunk on power, picked a man who can be fooled by a cake, and then dithered about whether to let him keep hurting the rest of us.

And Nicoles doing everything in her power to make sure she succeedsNicole and Penny have an incredibly close bond Image: Nicole GoldByJessica TaylorReal Le Features Writer:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsNicole Gold knew her daughter Penny was destined for fame when she was just a toddler - slipping into her mum’s high heels and tottering around. “From the time she could toddle she was in my shoes,” Nicole, , told The Mirror. “She was picking up my microphones too.” Nicole, who records her own music and performs at festivals, had grand plans for her daughter from birth - getting Penny a baby acting agent at the age of three months old. “She did a Fairy commercial and a couple of campaigns and photoshoots when she was really young,” Nicole, from Colchester, Essex, explained. Surrounded by the commotion of a TV crew and set, Penny barely batted an eyelid - signalling she was meant to be in front of a camera. Reflecting on her own childhood, musical Nicole, from Colchester, Essex, regrets that she didn’t go to stage school at a young age - waiting until she was older to put herself through a performing arts course. “I’d have loved itmy parents had pushed me into stage school. It would have been a lot easier to get into it,” she said. So when the mum-of-one fell pregnant, she decided she was going to push her daughter into singing, acting and dancing to take up the opportunities she felt she missed out on as a kid.  Penny, now six, takes on around  hours of activities every week that will prepare her for a career in showbiz - meaning dedicated mum Nicole spends her week ferrying her daughter to and from classes. “It’s a juggling act,” Nicole said. “But I’m training her for what she wants to do.” Penny’s jam-packed week begins with gymnastics on Monday, followed by Latin Ballroom lessons on Tuesday, circus school on Wednesday, and performing arts and musical theatre school on Saturday. She wakes up at around .am every day and Nicole aims to have her in bed by .pm so she can get plenty of rest for the busy day ahead. To fund the array of extra-curricular activities Penny takes part in, Nicole runs her own beauty business - dropping Penny off at her grandma’s house on Fridays so she can see clients. In keeping with her glamorous education, Nicole homeschools Penny, giving her singing lessons using YouTube videos and practising reading by rehearsing scripts. “I try to make it fun. To be honest, kids learn more when everything’s fun so I try to make it more into a bit of a game,” Nicole explained. She added she’d always considered homeschooling Penny but decided to send her to school shortly before the pandemic began. Then, when schools closed and all parents were forced to homeschool their kids, Nicole thought it would be best to carry on home education after classrooms welcomed pupils back. Are you a apospushy parentapos  We would love to hear from you. Email jessica.taylor@reachplc.  “She loves it - she’s got more friends than when she went to normal school. Where we live there’s a massive homeschooling community,” Nicole said. As she teaches Penny more about le and fame, Nicole is starting to see her daughter’s natural talents as she excels. “I’d like her to go into music but I can see her acting more when she grows up. She has a right little flair for dferent characters.” Nicole acknowledges she’s a “pushy” mum but believes her approach to parenting will encourage Penny to follow her dream and give it her all. “First and foremost I want her to be happy and the best she can be. If her best means she doesn’t make it, then that’s ok - as long as she’s done everything to the best of her ability,” she explained. “If Penny decides one day that she wants to go and be a vet, that’s ok too, as long as she gives it %.” However, she reckons her daughter’s love of performing arts will continue to flourish and propel her to fame as she grows up.

The British Airways service from Aberdeen was filmed coming into to land at Heathrow as Storm Corrie whipped up the air with buffeting winds.In the footage the pilot appears to have everything under control as the large passenger jet edges closer to the tarmac. One wheel touches down onto the ground before the plane bounces up and onto the other side, causing the flying vehicle to lurch up and then down with force. Suddenly it tips right over onto its left wheel before the tail of the plane almost smashes into the runway. The nervy manoeuvre, which ended with the jet having to accelerate off into the air to circle around and make another landing attempt, elicited great excitement from the Big Jet TV cameraman who caught the rare aviation moment.  In the video, which has been viewed more than , times online, a man behind the lens can be heard shouting easy as the plane wobbles. Oh my god, Gilly, he yells in amazement as the jet takes off. The powerful winds of Storm Corrie on Sunday and Monday, which reached mph in Inverbervie, Aberdeenshire, and Storm Malik the day before, didnapost just disrupt air travel. Tens of thousands of people were left without electricity and two people died. The Scottish Government said that of the , households that lost power as a result of both storms, all but around , were expected to be reconnected by Monday evening.  A nine-year-old boy in Staffordshire and a -year-old woman in Aberdeen lost their lives after the strong winds tore down trees on Saturday. Some schools in Aberdeenshire were either closed, or delayed opening on Monday, because of the disruption.  While the worst of the weather may be behind us, Tuesday is expected to be inclement for those in the north. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for the northwest and northeast of Scotland and suggested winds could reach mph. It covers an area just north of Perth, including Aberdeen and Inverness. Central Tayside and Fe, Grampian, Highlands and Eileen Star and Orkney and Shetland are the regions that will be affected. It will be in place from am until pm. According to the Met Office it is likely there will be some short-term loss of power.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeBritish AirwaysWeatherPlanes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The source told The Times: “A bit like supermarkets, we’ll almost certainly keep the same policy until it is safe to move.“For example, the rules in the US are very clear on masks. It would be ridiculous of us to ask passengers to put them on when we enter their airspace.” A second source added that although there are “hopes that one day we will have a world with no masks, they are going to be with us for a long time”. Each airline has its own policy regarding rules for face masks, and what proof may be required from passengers who are exempt for medical reasons from wearing a face covering while in the plane cabin.  Ryanair’s chief financial officer Neil Sorahan says masks will remain - just like rules on passengers removing liquids from hand luggage at security. “Masks will be something that will be with us for a while longer to come,” he said. “If that is the price we have to pay for the next few months, into summer — it’s a small price to pay.” Another senior aviation source said: Until there is a harmonised lting of mask mandates on flights by governments worldwide it is simpler for airlines to keep the rules in place. Virgin Atlantic told Sky News in a statement: We continue to input to the regulators and work together across industry to see when changes can be made, however until further notice, we will require all customers and crew to continue to wear face masks for the duration of their flights, as well as at the airports.

At worst, a waste of time and resources. It’s not though. It’s important. A tiny triumph. A baby step in the right direction. Bradford Police have launched an undercover operation to combat catcalling – “targeting people who are shouting things from their vehicles at women girls. This will not be tolerated.” Last week they stopped a van after the occupant yelled at some women who turned out to be plain-clothed police officers. Oh to have seen his face. He was reported for a breach of the Public Spaces Protection Order and is likely to be issued with a £ fine or taken to court, which is another way of saying that he was left in no doubt that THIS IS NOT OK. That’s apparently what men need to be told, reminded of, in no uncertain terms, so they’re one hundred per cent clear. No, it’s not just a bit of harmless fun that we need to lighten up about. It’s horrendous. Scary. Humiliating.  Maybe this concept is confusing because we’re living in an age of sharing, honesty, and talking about everything. Mostly that’s great, but somewhere within this, a simple truth has got lost. Sometimes, it’s good NOT to talk. Sometimes, you need to shut the hell up. Perhaps we need a massive advertising campaign, public service announcement telly commercials and posters everywhere to clearly inform everyone once and for all: Stop telling women what you think of their bodies. Especially when they haven’t asked, which is pretty much always. There are no Thought Police – anyone is free to think whatever they like. The opinions inside someone’s head can’t hurt anyone . The problem comes when they’re broadcast out loud to the woman you’re thinking them about, be it on the street, online, or on a radio show, like that fool who talked about Strictly’s Tilly Ramsay. What you think of the woman’s body is irrelevant, by the way. Evenyou believe it’s a compliment, still keep it to yourself. Of course there are exceptions to the rule, but most women do not feel flattered and delighted when a stranger gives them positive feedback about a body part. We feel embarrassed, and frightened. And we’re taught to ignore this behaviour – apart from in Bradford, it’s up to us to deal with it ourselves – to put our heads down, walk quicker, in case the situation escalates.We’re luckywe are only verbally harassed. Even online, where the threat of physical violence is removed, these kind of comments are dangerous, and unacceptable. They perpetuate the belief that women’s appearances are fair game for discussion and debate. That our bodies are anyone’s business but our own. They also ensure that the practice of speaking about women in this way seeps down to future generations, continuing the cycle. It has to stop. As the fight to make our streets safer for women goes on, catcalling being taken seriously in one city in the UK is just a drop in the ocean. But at least it’s a start. Maybe those TV ads aren’t a bad idea – and it’s obvious what music they should be set to. Ronan Keating, You Say It Best, When You Say Nothing At All.

Posting on the restaurantaposs Instagram page, the boss gave their former customers an ultimatum - pay up or they will go to the police and release CCTV images of them online.In the post, they said: Unfortunately tonight we have had a party of  leave an unpaid bill of over £. They received the same great service and good quality as all our paying customers this evening. We are giving this table the benefit of the doubt, to pay within  hours before we report this incident to the police and release their images on our social media.  We are an independently run business with a small team and we work hard to get where we are and we deserve better than this. Front of house worker Christina, who helped to serve the group on Saturday night, said the booking had originally been made for  people. However, when  of them arrived, staff moved tables and chairs to accommodate the extra numbers. The -year-old said: We are a very small independent business. We turned people away for them because we didnapost have room…” “So weaposve lost paying customers as well as losing £. When the bill arrived, Christina said four men from the group came to the counter to pay rather than waiting at their table for it to be brought to them. In the meantime, the rest of the party left the restaurant and got into cars outside. When theyaposve asked for the bill theyaposve seen the price of it, theyaposve proceeded to barter the price of the bill down saying theyaposre not paying that,” Christina said. Everything off their plates was gone. There was no food left over, they sent nothing back. Itaposs only upon paying the bill that the issue happens. I said aposyou donapost need a cash machine, we take card paymentsapos and as I turned around to direct him back into the restaurant he jumps in a car and he makes his exit. Christina said the man called the restaurant after he left last night to apologise and said he wouldto the restaurant at .am this morning with the money for the bill. However, it seemed to be an empty promise, with the man having never turned up. We feel really deflated, we work extremely hard,” Christina added. Itaposs called hospitality for a reason. We want you to come in, we want you to have a nice time. If thereaposs a problem we want to fix it but when we have tables like that it affects the rest of the restaurant and the rest of our customers who are trying to have a nice time. She wanted to send the message to the customers that there would be “no judgement”they decided to pay up now. “We are giving them the benefit of the doubt to collect that money and come and pay us because we deserve to be paid for the meals and the food. We donapost care about tips, we just want what is owed to us. No one is going to shout at them, no one is going to get them in trouble. Once the  hours is up weaposll report the incident to police and we will release their images because we donapost want any other businesses to have to go through what we did last night.

It was claimed he would have elite members of the Royal police squad acting as ball boys.But, speaking to The Sun Online, one ex-Royal cop, Paul Page, said thatthe Prince ordered him to fetch his balls he would “f****** knock him out”.Page protected the Royals for six years and confirmed previous reports of the Duke’s behaviour and said he’d seen it, but not been asked to do so himself.  He told the Sun: “If he had asked me to pick up his golf balls, Iaposd have f***ing knocked him out. Iaposm from the East End, I wouldnapost stand for that. He described the Duke as a “f***** a****** and a bully” who “treated his staff like s***”. Andrew is a keen golfer, but recently gave up his memberships of a number of prestigious golf clubs including The Royal and Ancient Club of St Andrews, where he’s been an honorary member since .  But now he faces a public civil lawsuit over sex abuse allegations. However, this is far from the first time that his behaviour towards staff has been called out. In Nigel Cawthorne’s  book ‘Prince Andrew: Epstein, Maxwell and the Palace’ he writes that an aide said: Iaposve seen him treat his staff in a shocking, appalling way. Heaposs been incredibly rude to his personal protection officers, literally throwing things on the ground and demanding they aposf***ing pick them upapos.  No social graces at all. Sure,youaposre a lady with blonde hair and big boobs, then I bet he is utterly charming. Only a few days ago, another allegation emerged where it was claimed Andrew shouted at a female gardener because he felt a tree had been cut wrongly. This came only days after being with his sex-abuse write by Virginia Giuffre. Page also told the Sun that Andrew would let Ghislaine Maxwell visit him at the Palace without signing her in, a signicant breach of Royal protocol. Speaking on ITV ’s ‘Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile’ Page said that Maxwell visited the Prince up to four times in a single day.Page said he suspected the pair “may have had an intimate relationship”. Page was jailed in  for his part in a £m property scam, he said: Iaposve admitted my crimes, and Iaposve served my time,. This all comes a few weeks after Andrew failed in his efforts to dismiss claims against him. Giuffre alleges that she was trafficked by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and forced to have sex with the Royal. Andrew denies all the claims against him.

Robert Hooper, , drove at the vehicle, lted it up in the air and flipped it onto its roof before pushing it into a road in an incident which was captured on video. Although the video clip, shot by the vehicleaposs driver, clearly shows Hooperaposs telehandler tractor leaving the car a smashed wreck, he denied dangerous driving and criminal damage of the Vauxhall Astra. Durham Crown Court heard he was under attack at the time of the incident from Charlie Burns, a friend of the driver Elliott Johnson, who was kicking the tractor and trying to punch him in the cab. In his anxiety to escape the attack, it is alleged, Hooper swung the tractor round quickly and struck Mr Burns, knocking him to the ground. David Ward, prosecuting, said the incident took place at .pm on June  last year after Mr Burns and Mr Johnson had spent a day swimming at Low Force near Barnard Castle, Co Durham. On their way home they passed by Hooperaposs Brockersgill Farm at Newbiggin-in-Teesdale, where Mr Johnsonaposs Astra - a courtesy carbelonging to Vauxhall Finance - suffered a double puncture.Mr Ward said: With only one spare wheel they were unable to fix the problem. They decided to move the car into the farm driveway off the B that passed the farm because it seemed the safest thing to do. It was a long driveway with an open field to one side, which they thought was the safest option. However Mr Hooper drove towards them in one of his vehicles and asked them to move the car. They said words to the effect that they would not be long and were arranging a recovery vehicle to move the car. Mr Hooper said he would move the car for them and went back to the farm and fixed loading equipment onto the front of his tractor, in effect a forklt device. He drove back and placed the lting rails under the car and pushed the car along the driveway, already causing damage. Mr Burns filmed this on his mobile phone.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Hooper began lting the end of the car as Mr Burns kicked the farm vehicle to no avail. Hooper tipped the vehicle onto its roof and pushed it out of the driveway, around the corner and onto the road. It was scraped along the ground suffering extensive damage. Mr Burns tried to hit Mr Hooper through the window of the tractor, seemingly trying to distract him from further damaging the vehicle. At that point, Mr Ward said, Hooper swung the telehandler round and struck Mr Burns on the back with the lting gear, sending him sprawling.  Mr Ward said that Hooper was arrested and interviewed by the police. He told them he was trying to push the car when it caught on the gate and flipped over.Mr Ward said: He said he was acting lawfully and in self defence at all times. Mr Hooper is a man of good character with no previousconvictions.Charlie Burns, , told the court of his confrontation with Hooper. He said that he and Elliot Johnson moved the car onto the long concrete driveway to the farm after a double puncture on the roadoutside.As they awaited roadside assistance he said Hooper approached and demanded they move the car. Mr Burns told Durham crown Court: He went back to the house and put the spikes on the front of his tractor, it took no more than a minute then he came back and started pushing the car I was kicking the tractor to try to distract him. I was wearing Nike trainers, I didnapost do any damage to it.  Apart from the flat tyres there was no damage to the car but when he started pushing it I imagine there was damage being done. Then the car goes in the air, the back end just flipped over. It was pushed out, he pushed it out onto the road. I started videoing it on my phone. The car was on its roof I reached my arm into his vehicle and caught him on the end of his chin with my finger, I was trying to stop him doing more damage to the car. I caused him no injury. I only caught him once.  He hit me on the back with the tractor. He was looking right at me, I wasnapost trying to hit him at that point.He knocked me off my feet. I was injured, I am still having physio now. I couldnapost walk properly thefollowing day, I needed help to walk.Hooper, of Brockersgill Farm, Newbiggin-in-Teesdale, pleaded not guilty to dangerous driving and criminal damage of the Vauxhall Astra. The trial, expected to last the week, continues.

He wrote: Perhaps, I thought, they were wearing them against air pollution, which is bad at the moment. Or because it was a cold morning and they actively enjoyed the warmth of their foetid breath circulating inside the germy fabric  Or perhaps, I supposed, these masked ninnies were still so afraid of the now-harmless bug that they were prepared to endure the mild discomfort and inconvenience that comes with the illusion of security provided by a mask.  Or perhaps, in their post-pandemic health hysteria, they were hoping now to protect themselves against flu, measles, hepatitis ... even cancer  . While masks are no longer a legal requirement in England, there are still some settings where they are recommended. Londoners need to keep wearing them when using Transport for London services.  While London Mayor Sadiq Khanaposs demands are not enforceable by police and do not carry a fine, face masks will remain a condition of carriage on TfL services. That means you can be refused admission to a Tube or bus without one. Mr Khan urged the PM to rethink scrapping face masks altogether.He said: Wearing a face covering is one of the single most important and easiest things we can all do to prevent the spread of Covid- and the Government should rethink their plans.Some supermarkets will continue to either ask or suggest that shoppers wear a mask. Sainsbury’s and John Lewis said their customers will be asked to wear masks, though the latter acknowledged it will ultimately come down to “personal choice”.

Her father George VI died suddenly on February , , and she became the monarch at the age of just .Throughout nearly all of her long reign, her beloved husband Prince Philip was at her side helping her to navigate le as Queen until his death aged  last year.Upon marrying the then Princess Elizabeth in , Philip gave up his Greek and Danish royal titles and was bestowed the title of Duke of Edinburgh. However, he was never King - even though his we was the Queen - and the reason for this is due to an old patriarchal system, where Kings outrank Queens.  If he had the title of King, he would have been a higher rank than the Queen - which would not have been allowed as he married into the royal family rather than being born into it.However, the rules mean it will be a dferent story when Prince William becomes King one day with the Duchess of Cambridge by his side.Itaposs likely that Kate will become Queen Consort, and itaposs likely that she will opt to be Queen Catherine.

Like Philip, as she wasnapost born into the royal family she can never be Queen in her own right but she can take the aposConsortapos role - which is what many wives have done in the past. King George VIaposs we became Queen Elizabeth, before becoming better known as The Queen Mother after the Kingaposs death. Explaining the role, royal expert Marlene Koenig said: Catherineaposs role will certainly change as she will be the consort of the sovereign. There is no real constitutional role for a consort, just by tradition.  “She will be the first lady of the land, in terms of precedence.However, before becoming Queen, itaposs likely that Kate will be given yet another new title.When Prince Charles becomes King, William will become the heir to the throne and will probably take on the title The Prince of Wales.It is not a given that William will get the title, as it has to be bestowed upon the heir by the monarch. However, experts predict it is more than likely that Charles will pass on his title to William.  If this happens, Kate would automatically become the Princess of Wales. The last person to hold this title was, of course, Williamaposs late mother Princess Diana. Charlesaposs second we, Camilla, decided against using the title out of respect for Diana.And according to a source,and when this is to happen, it would be an emotional moment for William.They told the: I’m sure it’ll be a bit of a bittersweet moment.This is her son and his we, so in some ways, it will be coming full circle—but it will also be a poignant reminder of what we all lost.

Carole MiddletonOne of the most successful Middletons in business is Kateaposs mum Carole, who heads up the firm Party Pieces.She was born in London and grew up in a relatively normal family in Southall, before becoming cabin crew with British Airways.  While working there, she met her husband Michael and the couple went on to have three children - Catherine , Pippa, then James. In , she set up Party Pieces from her kitchen table after she realised she could make money from creating party bags.

Click here to sign up.She told the Daily Mail : All I could find were basic clown plates.I realised there was a gap in the market for partyware that wasnapost too expensive and which looked good, so decided to design my own. I took some prototypes to ious High Street retailers and was turned away. However, despite being turned away from retailers, Carole knuckled down, set up her business and began handing out leaflets at her daughtersapos school - and the firm took off. Even Kate, Pippa and James were models in some of her early marketing materials. She added: Thirty-five years later, Iaposm launching the Party Pieces collection. I suppose some things are worth the wait! So rather than slowing down, this is an exciting new chapter for me. I think Iaposll always be interested in party trends. Pippa Middleton  Kateaposs sister Pippa shot to fame following her role as her sisteraposs bridesmaid at her wedding to Prince William. She graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a degree in English Literature and briefly worked in PR.

Harry introduced his then girlfriend Meghan to his brother and Kate at Kensington Palace a few months into their relationship. However, the book claims Meghan was left disappointed when she realised Kate was, as Scobie and Durand put it,an extremely guarded person” with a tight-knit group of friends - which stopped the two women from getting friendly. Meghan would agree with the assessment that the duchesses were not the best of friends, the authors wrote.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Their relationship hadn’t progressed much since she was Harryaposs girlfriend. Meghan was disappointed that she and Kate hadnapost bonded over the position they shared, but she wasnapost losing sleep over it, the source added. But it was Meghan’s “adoration” of Kate’s daughter Charlotte that dfused the tension between the pair. During the early days of their relationship, Meghan lived with Harry at his Kensington Palace home, Nottingham Cottage. With Harry and Meghanaposs place just around the corner from the Cambridges, Meghan spent a lot of time with Charlotte and her brothers George and Louis in the beginning. This encouraged the Cambridges and Sussexes to put their dferences aside when the kids were around. Following this, Meghan gted Kate a soft leather Smythson notebook which brought them together, and the pair later attended Wimbledon together two years in a row. Speaking about the details in the book, Scobie told People: A lot of damage has been done. He also claims that Kate barely acknowledged Meghan during their final engagement as a four before the Sussexes quit the royal family. The book also focuses on tensions between Harry and William which arose after the Duke of Cambridge angered the Duke of Sussex with comments about Meghan. According to their sources, William said: Don’t feel like you need to rush this and take as much time as you need to get to know this girl, reports People magazine. They write: Harry was p***ed off. P***ed off that his brother would ask such a thing. Some felt it was an overreaction. But then, this totally sums them up as people—William the calm and rational one, and Harry, who can’t help but take things far too personally.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

His funeral, attended by the young Queen, was the first to be televisedWeston-super-Mare in Somerset in  Image: SSPL via Getty ImagesByPaul Routledge:,  Feb |commentsBritain in  was a black and white world, in every way. There was no colour in the newspapers, no iety in the food we ate, no dazzling dresses and no arguing with your parents. I was a happy little eight-year-old boy attending All Saints Primary in Normanton, west Yorkshire, and we-to-be Lynne was six, a pupil in Christ Church infants’ in Wakefield.We knew nothing of the world beyond the garden gate, but that blissful ignorance was broken by the thunderclap announcement that King George VI had died.Mrs R recalls that a vicar came into the classroom, whispered something to the teacher, who then gave the doleful news. “Everyone burst into tears, so I did, too.”  This tragedy burst on a nation still recovering from a World War that cost almost half a million lives, military and civilian. Whole stretches of our great cities were bomb sites.But spirits were reviving. War hero Winston Churchill was back in No, and the BBC was belting out morale-raising Workers’ Playtime on the radio at lunchtime three days a week.Unemployment was virtually unknown, at .%. Most boys and girls left school at , and went to work in industry, commerce or shops. A small number passed the -plus to attend grammar school, and an even smaller number went to university. This was then still the workshop of the world. We drove British cars, motor cycles, vans, lorries and tractors, we listened to British radios and gramophones, we wore British-made clothes, flewin British aeroplanes and travelled on trainspulled by the latest British steam engines. The Welfare State was in its infancy, but we had the NHS, which saved millions from illness, we had child welfare, free school milk and family allowances.Father – usually the breadwinner – had two weeks’ paid holiday a year. Central heating in the home was unheard of. We had lovely coal fires. It wasn’t such a bad place to live, despite the continuation of wartime rationing. Every family had ration books with coupons to exchange for goods. Though we didn’t know it, we were poised to enter a new Elizabethan Age. It was February  when it was announced the King had died at Sandringham. His illness had been kept quiet, and the nation was shocked. His body lay in state in Westminster Hall for a week, and , people filed past his coffin, queuing up to four miles to pay their last respects.  His funeral, attended by the young Queen, was the first to be televised, leading to a run on the shops for TV sets. Her Coronation, broadcast live the next year, confirmed the trend to mass ownership. Before then, we had to be content with monochrome newspapers, plus newsreels like Pathe News, also black and white, with patriotic music, shown in cinemas long after the events they depicted. Television was still a novelty in , tiny nine-inch black and white screens. Nobody in my street had one. There was no commercial broadcasting in the UK, though young people strained to hear “pop music” on Radio Luxembourg. The BBC was still content to schedule Mantovani and his Strings. For public entertainment, there was dancing, the “flicks”, theatre and live music recitals. Pop festivals were way into the future. Many marriages were madein Mecca Locarno dance halls. The cinema was a huge attraction. Even small towns like Normanton had three, and they were often packed out.  was the year of High Noon and Gary Cooper, and Singin’ In The Rain with Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds. Bob Hope and Bing Crosby were making their wise-cracking Road To... films, and John Wayne starred in the romantic comedy The Quiet Man, a title later disastrously stolen by Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.But the most popular film here was the circus drama The Greatest Show On Earth, filmed in Technicolour and starring Cornel Wilde and Betty Hutton as trapeze artists and Charlton Heston as the ringmaster. Thirteen million tickets were sold, though many probably saw it twice. It featured real acts and hundreds of exotic animals. It could not be made today. The first singles chart was published by the New Musical Express, and the No was Al Martino’s Here In My Heart. These were the days of the crooner, such as Johnny “All of Me” Ray and Frankie “Christmas Roses” Laine. It was all very traditional stuff, but a revolution was on the horizon.  was the year Bill Haley  His Comets, started the rock ’n’ roll journey. But the main social hub was the pub. Beer cost ninepence [less than p] a pint, and it is what everyone drank, not lager or wine. They’d have thought Spritzer was a horse in the . at Wetherby, and Prosecco a hymn. Working men’s clubs did a roaring trade. The beer was cheaper, but women were often banned, except on concert nights . Clubs were the nurseries for singers and comedian, though the Saturday night audiences could be tough. Raucous shouts of “Gerrimoff!” frustrated many a talent. The clubs also ran day trips to the seaside for kids and families, and Christmas treats for pensioners. They were a vital,under-rated, part of the social fabric.  Children made their own fun. We played out in the street, the parks and the fields – even on bomb sites – from dawn till dusk, without the fears that plague today’s generation, until we were shouted in for their supper. We were in an out of each others’ houses, back doors usually open, and mental health problems did not figure on the radar. It seemed like a long, hot summer that would never end. There were no smartphones, no computer games, in fact no computers. Few kids had their own bedroom to which they could retreat with electronic gizmos. And no social media, the  for cyber-bullying.  Officially, sex had not yet been invented, but it was practised universally. Relationships were not taught in schools, only in the playground, and we found the kit was self-explanatory. Pregnancy outside marriage was frowned upon, and many young couples “had to get married”. Single families were rare, one poignant exception being war widows.Homosexuality was illegal, and gay men were still being prosecuted. Pornography was also unlawful, the preserve of the wealthy. Food was basic, almost a continuation of the wartime diet. It made for a slimmer, more healthy population, but it was grey. There were no ready meals, or frozen burgers. Meat and two veg was the staple dinner. Few people ate out. School dinners, costing a shilling a day , were basics such as shepherd’s pie.  Church attendance was much greater than today, and chapels still rang with Wesley’s great hymns. Anglican and Catholic faiths competed for the best Whitsun walks. It was a quieter, gentler time. Few people had cars – none in our street. We walked or cycled or took the bus, tram or train. We queued, and heaven help the “jumper”. With the most horrible conflict the world has known behind us, it was enough to get on with a peaceful le: food on the table, steady job, council houseyou were lucky, and a week’s holiday in Scarborough or Blackpool.  An excellent sufficiency, as my father, home after six years’ war service, used to say. Alas, it was not for everyone. Regulars and National Servicemen were fighting Communist forces in Korea in the “unknown war”. A new Elizabethan era was rising, but the old one was dying hard.

Since stepping down as a senior working royal and moving to America with we Meghan Markle, Harry has made several claims against his family. In March last year, he and Meghan sat down for a bombshell chat with Oprah Winfrey, where they alleged there had been conversations about how dark their son Archieaposs skin would be before he was born. Harry also revealed a rt between him and his brother, Prince William and he told how he felt really let down by his father, Prince Charles, and had been cut off financially by the royals. He also lashed out at Charles on the Armchair Expert podcast and the Apple series The Me You Canapost See.But with Harryaposs beloved grandmother the Queen suffering health issues last year and her Platinum Jubilee celebrations coming up, royal expert Katie Nicholl says he will try to keep things calmer. Katie told Closer magazine : Whether Harry has regrets or not, I don’t know, but what I do know is that he has a history of lashing out at the establishment before. He’s talked about his “accident of birth” and the “burden of the crown”.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .He’s been critical in the past, but then goes quiet. I think since last year he’s paused and reflected. And he’s realised how much last year took a toll on his grandmother, and doesn’t want to cause any more upset, so is laying low for now. There has been speculation Harry and Meghan couldto the UK for the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June. Since leaving for America, Harry has ed to the UK twice - for Prince Philipaposs funeral and to unveil a statue of his late mother son ArchieMeghan has yet towith son Archie, while daughter Lilibet, was born in America and has never been to England. Last month, royal sources revealed Charles has offered an olive branch to Harry by inviting his family to stay with him when they next visit the UK.However, it then emerged that Harry claims he is “unable tohome” after a decision following his exit from the royal family stripped him of his right to personal security provided by the Met Police. Harry, , has since decided to sue the British government by applying for a judicial review against the decision, which could see him face the Home Office at the court.

In an attempt to bust the myths of what actually goes on behind the doors of a mobile speed van, Go Safe Casualty Reduction Officer Gareth Thomas has revealed exactly how the cameras work.Speaking withNorth Wales Live , he said: I decided after retiring that I wanted to make theroadsas safe as they can be in this area.The aim of cameras is to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured on our roads. Go Safe prefers to educate drivers rather than punish them with fines and penalty points. Gareth has answered a number of the most common questions surrounding speed cameras, which can hopefully keep you away from getting a fine. Is it true that speed vans have to be visible at all times No. There are no laws about visibility, so there is nothing stopping an officer operating in the dark. But they donapost often choose to do this, and maintain that being visible acts as a deterrent in its own right. Gareth said: Legally, we donapost have to be visible. I could camouflage myselfI wanted to - but itaposs all about being fair, education and preventing an accident. EvenI parked my van and went for a walk somewhere, it would deter people speeding right away. Can officers only catch motorists travelling in one direction  No. Any car that passes a Go Safe van is recorded on the officeraposs camera. Soyouaposre exceeding the speed limit whether youaposre driving in the same or opposite direction to the van, you can expect a speeding ticket.  It is true that the  per cent rule exists  Yes. You will not get a ticket provided your speed does not exceed the limit by more than  per cent, plus mph on roads, Gareth says. So for example, travelling at mph or above in a mph zone will be recorded as a speeding offence. However, Go Safe say thresholds y and can change without notice. Officially, any speeding offence occurs at mph above the limit, but most forces will allow a iance. Are officers a revenue collector for the Government  No. Gareth, explained: Weaposre not here to get figures or to make money. Weaposre just here to catch the people who are speeding. If I get a day where I donapost get any drivers speeding, then I know Iaposve done my job. If Iaposve been working an eight hour sht, I just hope at least one person that day has escaped injury or a crash has been avoided. Can I get caught speeding more than once on the same day by the same camera  The current position with Go Safe is thatyou are caught twice in  minutes, it will be treated as one offence. In theory, a driver with a previously clean licence could be caught several times on the same day - and as a result be at risk of disqualication under the totting-up system.If you are caught speeding several times on the same journey and accept a fixed penalty for each, you could be at risk of a penalty points disqualication . Is it illegal to obstruct a vans view of the road  Yes. Obstructing a GoSafe vans field of view during its operational duties is an offence and you can be prosecuted for it. Do officers enforce anything other than speeding  Yes. Officers are there to make sure you are wearing a seat-belt and are not using your mobile phones behind the wheel. Anyone caught breaking these laws will be prosecuted. This is the reason why you sometimes see a GoSafe speed van in an area where there are already permanent speed cameras.  Is it illegal to flash your headlights to alert motorists of a GoSafe speed van  If drivers choose to flash to warn others about a speed van, they could be in breach of the law. Under section  of the Police Act  it is an offence to wilfully obstruct a constable in the execution of his her duty. However, Gareth says while it is an offence, it is very dficult to prove. He said: It doesnapost bother me that people flash to warn them of the speed van - I just want to educate people and the van to act as a speed deterrent. How long do GoSafe speed vans tend to stay at one particular spot  For technical reasons, a speed van will only remain in a certain spot for  minutes, Gareth said. During his average eight hour sht, he will normally visit three dferent spots across the region where he has been ordered to visit. Who decides where GoSafe speed vans park up  Enforcement is usually carried out in certain areas for a number of reasons, including: Death or serious injury has occurred at the location. Speeds in the area have been recorded as signicantly high. Speeding concerns have been raised by residents and those concerns have been corroborated by a traffic speed survey. Go Safe are supporting a police enforcement campaign What happensI am caught speeding  It all comes down to the circumstances within which you were caught speeding, and how much you were in excess of the limit.  The minimum penalty for being caught speeding on the UKaposs roads is a £ fine. But Gareth explained in some circumstances, police can offer the option of attending a speed awareness course - an alternative to a fine and penalty points. Gareth, said: An accredited course is far more likely to improve driver behaviour and consequently make our roads safer. Courses are available to drivers who respond quickly to the aposnoticesapos and who were driving at no more than  per cent, plus  mph above the posted speed limit.So for example, anyone travelling over mph on a motorway would not be offered the awareness course.Those who donapost have a clean licence at the time of the office, oryou have been on the course in the last three years, it is unlikely you will be offered the awareness course as an option.

You will be keen to take on new challenges as these arise and develop your own knowledge and skills.” But anyone who wants to apply to be a housekeeper for the Queen has to pass a secret test first, to set the special cleaners from the bunch. According to Tracey Waterman, the head of recruitment, the team sets a secret challenge to all interviewees to see how they react - and those that pass, get the job.  The premise behind it, she explains, is that she will place a dead fly somewhere around the room to seethe candidate notices it and how they dispose of it. Speaking during Channel aposs documentary Sandringham: The Royals at Christmas, she said: The dference between a housekeeper in a five-star hotel and in a royal Palace would be attention to detail. One of the tests I like to do, to seea candidate has a potential eye for detail, is to place a dead fly, either in the fireplace or on the carpet. Once the dead fly is placed, I then bring the candidate into the room. I lead them into the room quite slowly, just giving them a chance to glance at the room, have a little look at what we’ve got inside the room. Bringing them to the fireplace, maybe highlighting that we’ve got a beautul fireplace. It’s this hint that Tracey hopes will make them aware of the dead fly. But it’s not just about spotting the fly she says but what they dothey do notice it. She adds: It’s a great test, maybe out of  people half the candidates will notice the fly. One out of ten will actually bend down and pick it up, that’s the special housekeeper.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

I thought my we and her mother were watching me on the baby monitor to seeI made mistakes. “I thought they were hiding my medicine so they could drug me to make me stop talking. I was obsessively askingit was time to feed the babies, and how much they would need at their next feed, just repeating the same questions over and over. “Then all the hallucinating and obsessing about birds in the garden started. If I saw only one magpie in the garden I would obsess that something bad was going to happen to the babies, and Iaposd chase around the garden trying to find all its friends. “I’d be really gladI saw a robin in the garden and follow it about because when my we sees a robin she says it’s her dad who died, but I obsessed over them.  “I had a hallucination of my we carrying a bag down the side of our house, but I can’t have seen that, because I was sitting on the sofa with a wall in front of me. “I did a similar thing with my friend’s car, which I thought I saw, but it wasn’t there when I looked again.” Charity became pregnant following articial insemination in August , and along with we Sarah, an HGV driver was over the moon. The wives used a sperm donor from Denmark, and Charity had intra-uterine injections because of suspected polycystic oies she said. The mums-to-be were delighted when three little ones were spotted on the seven-week scan: each with their own amniotic sack and placenta, on March , .The babes, each weighing four pounds, were born by planned caesarean section after a -week uncomplicated pregnancy. The girls were strong enough to stay in the main hospital with mum, resting in special hot-cots, and fed via nasal-gastro tubes. The new mums cuddled and burped their tots, and changed many tiny nappies, before bringing their family home on April . But Charity Horton, , struggled to relax after babies Raine, Poppy and River were born, and once she got home from hospital barely slept for an entire week. Soon she became very ill and was convinced she was starving her tiny babies - even though the trio were perfectly healthy. And she believed her mother-in-law Cheryl Horton, , and we were hiding her medication, and that Cherylaposs dog was going to eat the babies. In the following weeks, her mental health spiralled, and she started to hallucinate thinking she could see through the walls. Convinced that magpies in her garden were a sign of bad luck, sheaposd chase them out the garden of their home in St Austell, Cornwall. Doctors initially prescribed the exhausted mum antidepressants and sleeping pills, but the depleted woman couldn’t find peace. Frightened Charity began to self-harm and take risks with her le. The troubled mum once tried to put her foot in scalding water to seeshe could feel the pain.  In a cry for help, she told her we she was going to take her own le, and disappeared, on April . Loved-ones including mum Joy Ternouth , was worried sick, she said. The family called the mental-health nurses and Charity, who ed home the same night, was admitted to Longreach mental health acute psychiatric ward on April . The mum was given support and a six-month course of antipsychotic drugs and was well enough tohome to her we and babies on May . After two weeks of in-patient treatment, she was on the road to recovery and able tohome. She spoke up about her experience to help other mums going through the same thing. Charity, a CCTV manager, said: “At first I didnapost think there was anything wrong I just thought I was high on le after having these three beautul girls. “Then we got home and I was so frightened of having to look after them. I was sure I was doing it wrong. “I convinced myself I had to feed them all at once. I couldn’t switch off or sleep at all. It was like I was wired. I could hear them all the time, and they always sounded really loud. “I feared they would die in their sleep, so when they were quiet I thought they were dead. Whenever they were awake I thought they needed something all the time. “I didn’t stop talking, I just kept repeating the same questions to my we and her mum all the time. It just got worse and worse, until I wanted to kill myself because I was in so much pain. “I just wanted the anxiety to stop. Looking back now it seems so scary. I just canapost believe that happened. It’s brilliant being a new mum now - I love it. “I’m really embracing it and making up for the lost time. I just laugh and play with them a lot and get them to smile. I’m so glad Iaposve got through it. “At leastmy girls go through mental health problems I’ll know how to help.” After a month, brave Charity confessed she was having thoughts about self-harm and was admitted to hospital, where she was diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. She said: I knew there was something wrong but not what it was.  “I desperately needed help. I threatened to hurt and then kill myself because I was hoping somebody would realise that I wasnapost me and that I was in this horrible place. “I just wanted to feel like myself again. I was glad to pack my bags - it was the right place for me. “I was too in my own head to worry about leaving the babies, I just need to get better. “After nine days I started really missing them so I knew I was getting better. They’re not quite sure why postpartum psychosis happens, about one in a thousand women get it, and it’s triggered by birth. “I imagine it’s the perfect storm of all the hormones of being a new mum, the stress, and being so tired. It’s a medical emergency -somebody gets it you need to ring an ambulance it’s that bad. “It’s rare, but be on the lookout for your family and friends just be aware of what can happen. One minute you seem fine but the next you don’t know what’s going on.” If you are suffering from postnatal depression, donapost struggle in silence. PANDAS is a charity dedicated to helping people.

The UKHSA says a Covid sufferer who has tested positive at least  days after a previous infection will now be considered a reinfection, whereas people were previously only counted in the figures the first time they tested positive for the virus. As a result, updated figures for England show ,, episodes of infection since the start of the pandemic, with ,reinfections added to the total case number for the country.

Filling the gap with glue to hold it firm, she says she has no regrets about her spot of self-dentistry.She says her local dentist closed before the pandemic and has had trouble finding one since. After trying to get an NHS dentist appointment, she took matters into her own hands and applied the treatment in her living room. Mrs Sheen, who suffers from gum disease, said one of her teeth had started to come loose - and went online to come up with a plan to make things better. Two years on, she says she doesnapost regret a thing. She explained: I have bleeding gums every time I clean my teeth and it’s making me not want to clean them as I hate the taste of blood and all my teeth are getting wobbly. One in front was so wobbly it had to come out as I couldn’t eat with it so I put Elastoplast on the end of the pliers and tugged it out. The only thing I could think of was melting glue and moulding it into the gap. It’s been two years now.  It’s working okay, I can actually smile without seeing a gap. NHS England recently announced they would provide an extra £ million for dentists to provide additional urgent care for NHS patients. The unprecedented backlog has left dentistry hanging by a thread with many dentists looking to change careers or seeking early retirement. On January  NHS England pledged an extra £ million for dentists to provide additional urgent care for NHS patients. Funding will be available until the end of March and will be paid on a sessional basis. “Any additional funding is long overdue recognition of the huge backlogs facing NHS dentistry” said General Dental Practice Committee Chair Shawn Charlwood. “After a decade of cuts a cash-starved service risks being offered money that can’t be spent. Hard-pressed practices are working against the clock, and many will struggle to find capacity ahead of April for this investment to make a dference. “Until today not a penny of the government’s multi-billion-pound catch-up programme had reached dentistry. This is progress but must be just the startwe are to rebuild a service millions depend on.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSDentist\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The woman, whose post went viral told viewes in a video caption: “When you gotta work an hr sht  days a week and ppl don’t even know you sleep in a car.She said that her situation left her exhuasted, addding: “But I’m still here to make money so I can eat and even get a hotel sometimes.”After posting her heartbreaking story online Aaliyah, who works at Home Depot, became the victim of internet trolls who claimed she was only seeking attention and “faking homelessness”. In a response to the attacks she posted another video showing the inside of her car, piled with her meager possessions. In the caption she hit back: “I’m running off hrs of sleep literally, I wish it was a f—ing lie.” In another video Aaliyah says she captures the moment police officers searched her car, after claiming the “tint on the window was too dark.” But the woman was able to find help after her videos went viral, being viewed almost five million times.

Whitney Paige Venable, from Florida, was mortied during the exchange at the Orlando theme park, and believes the request came due to people feeling uncomfortable about her naturally large breasts.The -year-old, who has previously suffered discrimination for her curvy shape, claims that an employee informed her that she would have to cover up her cleavageshe wanted to be let into the park. Whitney was wearing a white crop top and mint green shorts at the time of the incident, which took place in June , and she claims many other women were wearing similar outfits. I felt humiliated and embarrassed. I was told I had to change my top to be able to enter. I think itaposs because I have naturally big breasts and it makes people uncomfortable but at far as I know my clothing wasnapost against the rules, she said. I feel like I was discriminated against because of the size of my breasts. I noticed other people staring and I felt really embarrassed. It was humiliating. Whitney and her pal filmed themselves as they excitedly waited to go into the theme park, but moments later, film shows them standing at the entrance being told the modelaposs outfit was inappropriate. In the clip, she can be heard saying: So, I guess my top is inappropriate for Universal, weaposre having a problem right now. So apparently I have to go change into a more appropriate top even though Iaposve seen a lot of people here in sports bra-looking tops. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Looking back a the incident several month later, the model said: I felt like I was being targeted and it was the summer so it was hot, I didnapost really understand [the issue] but having natural large breast brings attention. I ended up putting on another top over the sports bra, my friend had another top in the car. But I ended up taking it off later on in the park because it was hot and ugly and the fact I was judged really pi**ed me off. Smaller women can wear whatever they want – having big breasts however gets sexualised.This isnapost the first time the model has hit the headlines due to her looks. Last year, Whitney claims she was banned on Twitter for being too hot with people reporting her saucy snaps because they are jealous of her beauty.One day, I changed my cover photo to an innocent shot of me showing off my figure – but I was wearing underwear. And suddenly, my account was banned. It made me feel discriminated against because there are far worse pictures on Twitter. Some of them look like actual p*rn showing off really graphic angles. I’m sure thatI wasn’t so good-looking the photo would have stayed up.

We still havenapost decided on a first name for our child, but I made the choiceto give her the middle name of a deceased friend of mine whom I loved very much, she wrote on Reddit.My dear mum-in-law visited us over the weekend and not only trashes our home but pays me no mind at all during her entire visit. All she does is fuss over how my husband is going to be a dad and sheaposs going to be a grandma, ignoring the woman literally carrying her grandchild. The most interaction she has had with me so far is barking orders at me. However, on Sunday, while the family were having dinner, her mum-in-law turned to her husband and asked what he was planning to call the baby.  She continued: I piped up since Iaposm fed up with her acting like my husband is the one whoaposs carrying her grandkid. I told her, aposwe havenapost decided on a first name yet, but her middle name will bein honour of one of my best friends who died a few years back,you have any suggestions for her first name, weaposd be more than happy to hear them.apos The woman said her mother-in-law then turned to her and gave her the dirtiest look sheaposs ever received in her le, before launching into a vicious rant. Her mother-in-law told her: First of all why was I not informed that you had already made a choice regarding my granddaughteraposs name  Did you even consult [my husband] when you decided to give the baby that name ! Look, Iaposm sure your friend was a great person but I donapost approve of the name at all. Iaposm sorry, the person may have been nice but the name isnapost nice at all! Instead of honouring the girl by naming my grandbaby after her, why donapost you honour her by raising the child to be a good, religious, pious lady ! Oh wait, you canapost I suppose. Youaposre a lazy, good-for-nothing, useless junkie. Youaposre the opposite of what a mum should be. Iaposm ashamed that your carrying my grandchild, slut! At this point, the woman ran out of the room crying while she could hear her husband yelling at his mum and kicking her out the house.Iaposve blocked her on everything and had my husband withdraw ourselves from Christmas dinner with his side of the family. The whole ordeal also reminded my of the trauma of losing the friend i mentioned. I really hope my daughter doesnapost inherit anything from that awful woman.

Here’s what you need to know about the festival including superstitions and traditions that people observeChinese New Year depends on the lunar cycle and usually falls  to  days after New Year Image: ROMAN PILIPEY EPA-EFE REX ShutterstockByMalvika PadinTrends Writer:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsEvery year, a large section of the world’s population prepares to welcome New Year for a second time. Chinese New Year, which is based on the lunar calendar, always falls between  and  days behind the international calendar for each year. Each year a new animal from the Chinese zodiac takes over – this year being the Year of the Tiger. Also known as Spring Festival, there are plenty of celebrations associated with the Lunar New Year.This includes having a reunion dinner with family, giving red envelopes of money, and fireworks, as well as watching lion and dragon dances.Besides the festivities, many people believe there are several superstitions and traditions to be observed during the Chinese New Year, which will end up affecting your luck for the rest of the year.Here are nine of the many Chinese New Year superstitions people follow. Avoid taking medicines  Itaposs considered taboo for a person to brew herbal medicine or take medicine on the first day of the lunar year. If they do itaposs believed they will be ill for the whole year. In some places, after announcing the New Year at midnight, sick people break medicine pots following a custom that believes this drives away illnesses in the coming year. Donapost wash your hair or get a haircut The word aposhairapos in Mandarin Chinese has the same pronunciation as the phrase aposto become wealthyapos. So itaposs not seen as a good thing to wash your hair during the New Year as this is seen as washing away oneaposs fortune. Haircuts are always avoided because thereaposs a belief that it brings bad luck to your uncles. However, in recent times, itaposs become increasingly popular to get a haircut before Chinese New Year for a new lookin the coming year. Donapost sweep or throw out garbage Sweeping on New Yearaposs Day is thought to be like sweeping wealth away. Similarly, taking out garbage is seen as dumping the good luck or good fortune from the house.  Donapost wash your clothes on the first and second day of the new year, as these two days are celebrated as the birthday of the water god. Washing clothes, therefore, is seen as as disrespect to the god of water. Itaposs also believed that water symbolises wealth, so pouring away water after washing clothes is like pouring your wealth away. Donapost eat porridge or meat Rich porridge - or congee - was traditionally considered something only poor people have for breakfast. People donapost eat porridge during Chinese New Year because they donapost want to start off the year poor. Meat is not eaten out of respect for Buddhist gods, as all gods are believed to be out meeting and wishing a happy New Year to each other. Avoid using scissors or knives The blades of scissors are seen as sharp lips when people quarrel. If you use scissors on the first day of the Chinese New Year it is perceived as an invocation for arguments with others in the coming year. Similarly knives are avoided because any accident - whether harming a person or tool - is thought to lead to inauspicious things and the decrease in wealth in the coming year. Children shouldnapost cry  Crying children are thought to bring bad luck to the family, so parents do their best to keep children from crying during the festive period by whatever means possible. Try not to break anything Breaking symbolises incompleteness and bad luck. If you break a bowl, plate, glass, vase or mirror during the Spring Festival, this is thought to bring bad fortune, monetary loss or family breakup. If someone breaks something by accident, people usually use red paper to wrap up the broken fragments, and then say Sui sui ping’an which means ‘all year round safe and sound’. Donapost dress in black or white People donapost dress in black or white clothes during the new year as these two colours are traditionally associated with mourning in Chinese culture.

At least , Russian forces are already gathered on Ukraine’s eastern flank and off the coast in navy warships. Russia has claimed the Belarus build-up is for joint exercises with local forces, although the numbers are way over the threshold for non-lethal wargaming.  On Tuesday a UK security source told the Daily Mirror: “So many Spetsnaz in the region is a very worrying development. “In times of war the primaryof Spetznaz troops is infiltration, insertion behind enemy lines, either in unorm or civilian clothing.  “This is usually well before hostilities begin and once in place to commit acts of sabotage, destruction of communications, logistics centres and the assasination of key government leaders and military officers.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has boosted his armed forces by , troops over three years and raised soldiers’ pay.

Another recent World Meteorological Organizationrecord was set in , when a lightning bolt over Uruguay and northern Argentina lasted . seconds.  Lightning does not typically last for longer than a second, or stretch further than  miles, Randall Cerveny at Arizona State University, told the New Scientist. Rather than moving from sky to ground, as a regular strike would, the lightning moved from cloud to cloud. WMO spokesperson Clare Nullis said the trip by air would take a couple of hours. In this case, the distance was covered in a matter of seconds, she said.  We reiterate our message: when thunder roars, when you see lightning - go indoors. Donapost seek shelter in a beach hut, donapost stand under a tree, Nullis said. Both record-setting bolts were spotted in South America’s Great Planes of America and the Río de la Plata basin, areas known as thunderstorm hotspots.Thunderstorms occurring in these areas would often develop into huge weather events, bringing large lightning strikes, as they are prone to relatively big convective systems.The WMO confirmed the new records’ validity through the y process of tracking the strikes via a satellite tracking system. As both records happened in , it is thought the two weather events could show that weather events like thunderstorms, which kills hundreds of people a year, are becoming extreme. Despite this, it could also be down to improved technology that the record-setting strikes were observed so closely together.

She added that some head teachers would also be expected to retire within the transition period.#Job sizing will be criticalthe proposals are to be implemented,# Ms Connor said.Council documents explain that the process of job sizing takes into account the size of schools, leadership roles and teaching time when deciding on the salary scale for promoted posts in education.#Head teachers retiring would also form part of the modelling,# Ms Connor added. #If a school collective was agreed where there were, for example, seven head teachers then two might be retiring and that would form part of the model.#Until collectives are looked at in more detail we can#t have a clear idea of staff numbers.#As part of the consultation process, which started in November and is due to finish on March , the council has shared its proposals with parent groups and community councils.Feedback from the consultation is timetabled to be presented to Argyll and Bute Council in April.This will be followed by the proposals being voted on towards the end of  and,approved, interim processes to bring in the changes would begin in spring .At Tuesday#s meeting it was explained, however, that the consultation will continue throughout the process with pupils, parents and educators being included in the process throughout.In addition, dialogue is continuing with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles concerning the involvement of faith schools in school collectives.These discussions were described by council officers as #ongoing# and #collaborative#.Concerns were also raised about the timing of the proposed changes, coming when pupils# education and wellbeing had been impacted by the pandemic.Acting Head of Education Learning and Teaching Wendy Brownlie said: #Young people#s views have been gathered throughout and they have expressed really interesting points both for and against the changes.#The consultation paper addresses the issue of the pandemic by saying: #The last couple of years have been extraordinarily challenging for schools. But we need to keep thinking long term.#"},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts january 28 2022","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Craignish Village Hall is to host a bike clinic.Bring your bike along to Craignish Village Hall on January  and have it looked over by qualied cycle technicians at socially-distanced workstations.The workshop is suitable for anyone wanting to learn how to keep their bike in good working order and to increase their basic cycle maintenance skills.Organisers hope balance bikes will be available for budding cyclists, as well as ebikes for adults to try.Tea and coffee will be provided and there is no need to book.This workshop is supported by Craignish Village Hall and the Corra Foundation in  collaboration with Act, The Ardrishaig Bothy and local Cycling UK project co-ordinator Joanne Clark.Unpaid carers in communities near Cairndow may soon be able to take a well-earned breather thanks to a scheme proposed by community enterprise Here We Are.The #sit-in# service would allow volunteers to sit with a cared-for person to give the carer a break, or perhaps the volunteer might simply drop in for a chat with someone living alone.Staff at Here We Are, based at Clachan beside the Tree Shop, are currently looking into how the scheme might work in Cairndow and Strachur and would like to hear from anyone who might benefit from this free community service.Contact Dot Chalmers or Fiona Campbell at Here We Are on  , or email mail@hereweare-uk for more information.Kilchrenan Primary School parents and education officials have decided to move its six pupils to Taynuilt from Valentine#s Day.Head teacher Graham Dickie is retiring and no-one is in line to replace him.An Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: #Taking these factors into consideration parents, in collaboration with the council, have decided to move pupils to Taynuilt from February .#A paper is being prepared for the Community Services Committee to outline the details and options moving forward.#Councillor Elaine Robertson said: #It is always very sad when a local school is no longer operational, both for the families and the community.

It will focus our minds next week.“The games in November were excellent in terms of seeing fans back when we arrived at the stadium, the noise they generated when we came on to the field and how they helped us through those games. So to have them there for our biggest fixture of the year will be a great boost to us.“We’ve also got three away games this year, so we’ll also have to handle those occasions where the crowd are against us and for the home team.

been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.What is the history of an Address to a Haggis The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost!

Pugh’s monumental history of Dunbar is consulted, we read that there was a turnpike toll at Kirkhill near the town’s parish church another on the main road through Belhaven and a third known as Cleikimin Toll on the road from Dunbar to Spott.Kirkhill Toll stood near the parish church, near the former site of the Bellevue Hotel there is a house at the site today but this rather large two-story building does not look like a toll-house.Cleikimin Toll stood until Edwardian times but is today buried underneath the A road.Mr Pugh assures us that Belhaven Toll was known within living memory to bus drivers and conductors, but its situation has been open to debate.The Canmore database of Historic Environment Scotland contains the following reference to it: “Benston Cottage, in the angle between the Aand the south going cross road, is reported locally to have been a toll house, but it shows no features distinguishing as such apart, perhaps, from an outshot  foot square abutting its E end, with a small window facing the road. Visited  February .”Now who is right  The Belhaven locals or the Edinburgh architectural historian The earliest newspaper mention of Belhaven Toll is from July , when a certain James M’Dougal was on trial in Edinburgh for issuing counterfeit £ banknotes.The prisoner had asked several toll-keepers to issue change for his bogus banknotes, but when he came to Belhaven Toll and asked for a glass of whisky, the tollkeeper James Liddle did not at all like the look of the £ note he was handed.After the scoundrel M’Dougal had beaten a hasty retreat, Liddle gave the banknote to a Dunbar bank agent who pronounced it to be a forgery.M’Dougal was found guilty and sentenced to death issuing  banknotes was considered a heinous offence in those days.The property page of The Scotsman of March ,  contains the following important notice: “LAND AND HOUSES NEAR DUNBAR.It says: “The park adjoining the post-road on the west side of Belhaven Toll, consisting of  acres English measure or thereby, as presently possessed by Mr France, together with the dwelling-house, large garden, and offices thereon, called Rosebank.”It turns out that Rosebank House is still standing today, although a number of houses have been built in its extensive grounds, some of them along Edinburgh Road itself, including the former Belhaven police station.The next mention of Belhaven Toll is in the Edinburgh Evening Courant of October , , announcing the sale of “That PIECE of ENCLOSED GROUND, extending to   Acres imperial measure of thereby, situated to the South of Belhaven Toll-Bar, on the West Side of the road leading from Belhaven to Spott, and contiguous to the Line of the North British Railway Company”.These newspaper notices establish, without any doubt, that there was a toll-bar at Belhaven, constructed before  and still operational in  when the arrival of the railways meant that the old tollgates were under threat.William Forrest’s  map of Haddingtonshire tells us that the toll was there already by that time, at the junction of the post-road and a road going to the south-east.The newspapers provide some further valuable clues to its position.Back in , the grounds of Rosebank were on the south side of the post-road [today Edinburgh Road], just west of the junction with the road from Belhaven to Spott [today Beveridge Row].In , the farmland between Belhaven and the mainline railway was bordering what is today the west side of Beveridge Row and stated to be situated to the south of Belhaven Toll.This would indicate that the toll-house was situated at the corner of Edinburgh Road and Beveridge Row, and indeed this is the exact position of ‘Benston Cottage’ described in the Canmore survey by the doubting Edinburgh historian. I would not agree with the opinion of this inidual that the building looks unlike a toll-house.The Edinburgh toll-houses, of which specimens survive at Morningside and Merchiston, are single-storey buildings but have some quaint architectural features. The East Lothian toll-houses were even more primitive, even by the standards of the time: small and low cottages offering only the most basic amenities.Belhaven Toll – alias Benston Cottage – very much, in fact, resembles the Goatfield toll-house at what is today  Dunbar Road, Haddington, and the surviving toll-house in Haddington, Abbey and Aberlady.Thus it can be concluded that the locals were right, and that Belhaven Toll still stands today!On the morning of September , , the No.  bus between Dunbar and North Berwick took off without any incident.But on Edinburgh Road, Belhaven, it was involved in a collision with a Vauxhall Antara and veered off the road, crashing right into. . . Benston Cottage alias Belhaven Toll!Fortunately, the cottage was empty as it was undergoing renovation further remedial work would surely be needed since the bus hit it with considerable force, knocking down the front door and some of the wall.A number of police and firefighters were soon at the scene, successfully cutting the trapped bus driver free using hydraulic gear and making sure that the other victims of the crash were taken away in ambulances. A -year-old East Linton RAF veteran, who had been a passenger on the bus, hit a handrail hard and later died in hospital.A -year-old man, the driver of the Antara, was charged with causing the incident, being handed by the courts an order of  hours of community service and banned from driving for three years.As for the battered former toll-house, it was repaired and taken care of by a firm of property developers, and is today used as a holiday let for out-of-town sportsmen and visitors, ‘sleeping six’ in the restored cottage and offering extra storage for surf boards and golf clubs.It is curious that neither the newspaper accounts of the bus crash, nor the Benston Cottage homepage ‘fishing’ for customers, mention the interesting past of the former toll-house.History can be made, but it can equally easily be forgotten."},{"url":null,"title":"families-invited-enjoy-six-week-library-programme","story":"Starting next month at Prestonpans Library but open to all, a group to support parents and carers develop a love of reading together will gather weekly in small informal groups for East Lothian Council’s ‘The Big Read’.The Big Read is a six-week programme to help parents and children develop a family reading habit.Parents carers will meet as a group to choose books and discover ways to engage their children – on alternate weeks, children will join for stories and crafts.Each child that takes part will receive three free books and a certicate.For more information or to register, families should email cmesser@eastlothian.gov.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"snooker-legends-coming-musselburgh","story":"The two will recreate some of their most famous duels, accompanied by icon John Virgo as referee and host delivering his famous snooker impressions.The night will conclude with a Q and A session with a chance to ask your favourite stars the burning questions you’ve always wanted to ask.: Craig Hills Pumped! comes to MusselburghVIP tickets are also available which will allow locals to get up close and personal with their favourite stars of the sport as well as premium seating and a complimentary drink.The show will take place on Wednesday, March  at .pm, with the VIP meet and greet taking place at pm.Tickets are £and can be purchased via telephone    or online at www.thebrunton  "},{"url":null,"title":"plans-submitted-starbucks-edge-dunbar","story":"Plans were lodged last week for the international chain to open a new drive-thru beside the town’s McDonald’s restaurant at DunBear Park.New proposals, submitted by Ormiston-based Burton  Speke Ltd, are for advertising consent and show the location of ious signs for the proposed restaurant.Already, plans are with East Lothian Council for Lidl and BM to open on the site, to the rear of the town’s Asda store."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-charity-seeking-donations","story":"Dunbar FoodShare is urging people to donate items, including washing powder, dry cat food and cat litter.Donations can be made at BeGreen Dunbar, Asda or the town’s library.The charity offers help to iniduals going through a crisis of any sort that leaves them vulnerable and without the capacity to feed themselves and their family."},{"url":null,"title":"mystery-east-linton-toll","story":"Haddington had three of them, all still standing, and the former toll-house in Belhaven is also still there today.Kirkhill Toll in Dunbar has been demolished, nor is there any longer a toll-house in Broxburn.There have been ergent opinions whether there was also a turnpike toll in East Linton, with some suspecting that there had been a mix-up with the undoubted toll-house in West Linton, Borders [still standing and the Olde Toll Tea House today].Both places were referred to just as ‘Linton’ in Victorian times, confounding the postmen and delivery boys for many years until the names were changed.A key source about East Lothian toll-houses and milestones is Forrest’s  map of Haddingtonshire.This map clearly shows a ‘Toll Barr’ just to the south-east of the village of Linton, situated at a crossroads to be able to charge toll in both directions.A toll in the vicinity of Linton is referred to already in Taylor  Skinner’s  Survey of the Roads.The next source is the  Itinerary of Scotland, which mentions Linton Toll-bar, just at the east of the village.Importantly, the name-book of the - Ordnance Survey [OS    ] lists the house as “A toll gate at which road dues are collected between Linton and Dunbar.“It is the property of the County road trustees, and is at present occupied by Gilbert Miller.”Thus it can be concluded that East Linton did, indeed, have a turnpike toll-house, probably dating back at least to the mid-th century when the tollbars were set up and the houses constructed along the main turnpike road.Like the other tolls mentioned here, it was a casualty to the railways being constructed, reducing road traffic very considerably and starving the toll-keepers out of existence in late Victorian times.But where is the old toll-house today There is no building on the main road past East Linton in any way resembling a toll-house, and the crossroads where it once stood has long since disappeared after a scheme to construct a bypass outside the village.Computerised super-imposition of a present-day map of East Linton onto Forrest’s  map indicates that the toll-house would be situated close to what is today Lauder Place.And, indeed, a stroll through those parts reveals the existence of the ‘Old Toll House’, accessed through a driveway from Lauder Place.A humble, single-story building just like the other East Lothian toll-houses, it has been signicantly extended at the back.By the present owner, it was identied as the former toll-house by the original deeds, which have since been mislaid.It would today have had a most tranquil situation, far from any of the major roads, had not the mainline railway been just a few feet away, with the trains roaring by with a deafening noise.When its present owner bought the old toll-house  years ago, it was in decent repair, albeit very small and cramped.Curiously, there was then a three foot square stone built room with a small window with iron bars, a prison cell perhaps, intended for people who refused to pay the toll But since the toll-keepers had no powers to imprison people, perhaps it was rather a whisky store, since the toll-keepers often doubled as low-level publicans It is also possible that the magistrates required a convenient holding-cell for local offenders before taking them to a burgh tolbooth.Since the ‘cell’ has long since been removed and the toll-house extensively renovated, with no original features remaining, we will never know.The East Lothian authorities built their toll-houses sturdy and strong, and the Old Toll House in East Linton is likely to stand for centuries to come.Jan Bondeson"},{"url":null,"title":"storm-malik-power-restored-county-clear-up-effort-underway","story":"Households in parts of Dunbar, East Linton, Innerwick and Garvald who were left without power following the storm this weekend have had their supplies restored.SP Energy Networks, which own and operates the electricity transmission and distribution network in south east Scotland, said that power was restored as quickly as possible following the storm.A statement on its Twitter said: \"We’d like to apologise to any of our customers who lost power during the storm and thank you for your patience as we work as quickly, and safely, as we can to clear any debris and reconnect services.\"Extreme weather conditions like gale force winds can make it extremely challenging for our engineering teams to fix issues with the network, especiallyclimbing poles or pylons is required.

age groups, continued caution is prudent at this stage.”The new sub-iant - BA. - has been identied and is currently being investigated.The First Minister has said that BA. is \"not a cause for any

has said, though this number is likely to be an underestimate.The First Minister told MSPs: “Genomic sequencing is being used to investigate this further.“So far, I can confirm that in Scotland,  cases of BA. have been confirmed through genomic sequencing but we expect this number to increase as more sequencing results are reported.“And given that not all tests are genomically sequenced, it will be an underestimate of the presence of this sub-iant here.”She said there was no evidence that BA. led to more serious illness or had a greater chance of escaping immunity, however it appeared to be able to “out-run” Omicron.Flu vaccinations have now resumed for vulnerable groups. You should visit the NHS inform website to arrange to get your flu jab. Ms Sturgeon urged those who are eligible for their booster jab to get their vaccine. From February , vaccinated travellers, who are fully vaccinated or under , will no longer need to take a pre-departure Covid test and they will no longer be required to self-isolate on arrival until theyve received a negative result.Travellers in this group will still need to take a test on or before day  after arriving in the UK - which can be a lateral flow device rather than a PCR test from Sunday.Anyone who tests positive on their lateral flow test will need to isolate and take a free confirmatory PCR test.The new measures apply across the UK after an agreement between the UK Government and the three devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.Ms Sturgeon warned last week that travel restrictions could be reintroduced in light of a new iant so this is constantly being monitored. See the full guidance via the Scottish Government website.Today, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people

address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"new-highway-code-2022-test-new-rules-starting-today","story":"Major changes to the Highway Code requiring drivers to have more responsibility to look out for cyclists and pedestrians risk failing to boost safety due to not being widely promoted, campaigners have warned.Charity Cycling UK said that a “long-term and well-funded communications campaign” is needed to make people aware of the update.The Highway Code, which contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads, is being amended this weekend to introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.Here’s everything you need to know about what’s new as the rules of the roads receive an update.Hierarchy of road usersA new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users.Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.Cycling in groupsPeople cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle chargingElectric car owners using a public chargepoint should park near the device and avoid creating a trip hazard from trailing cables."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12800707.jpg?type=article-full","title":"runs-scotland-investigation-scotlands-corridors-power-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access to the people and organisations with signicant influence over so many aspects of our lives. From the hundreds of secret lobbying meetings to who really runs Scotlands wind farms, whisky and media -

This, of course, was exactly what was promised by Gordon Brown and David Cameron in . Instead, Westminster delivered Brexit, the UK Internal Market Bill, muscular unionism and the Government of Boris Johnston. I doubtMr Smith will find the answer to his fears in the Labour Party, which remains electorally irrelevant in Scotland.It is interesting that Mark Smith fails to mention the Scottish Conservatives as worthy opponents of the independence movement. Labelled as “lightweights” and “nobodies” by senior UK Government ministers, their beleaguered leader, Douglas Ross has now tasted the realpolitik of how Scotland is regarded by the UK Government. The Partygate fiasco has illustrated just how impotent all Scottish MPs are at Westminster, even when they belong to the party of government.However, I have good news for Mr Smith. The question of independence will soon be settled, perhaps much sooner than he thinks. Sustained pressure, both legal and democratic, will precipitate a second independence referendum. After all that has happened since , I am confident that the people of Scotland will choose to run their own affairs and Scotland will become an independent country. In common with all  nations which have gained independence from the UK, Scotland will not turn back but will rapidly establish its place in Europe, Nato and the UN as a thriving modern democracy. Mr Smith’s angst will be salved, the independence issue will be settled.Iain Gunn, Elgin.LABOUR MUST NOT PLAY THE SNP GAMEJUST who is advising Sir Keir Starmer on Scotlandhe thinks that the priority of any incoming Labour Government is more powers for Scotland Labour will only get elected again at a UK levelit looks and sounds like a Labour Party. It cannot out-compete the SNP on the constitutional question. If the Labour Party does not understand the value of being in a union, then what does it actually believe in  Surely it should understand what the arguments are.If it wants people to vote for it, then it should make itself visible and relevant to the electorate. Instead of trying to find an angle on the constitution, it should simply go out and find a whole lot of doctors, nurses, shop workers, lorry drivers and policemen to stand as candidates, people who really understand what is going on in the world at present. We will need  years to get properly out of the Covid situation. Concentrate on that, and Labour might stand a chance. Play the game that the SNP wants you to play and you can forget about it.Victor Clements, Aberfeldy.THE UKS MORAL BANKRUPTCYI AGREE with your correspondent Michael Sheridanwhen he describes the slogan \"Its Scotland Oil\" as depressing. To me the slogan represented the worst form of a narrow parochial nationalism, the opposite of what an outward-looking country should seek to be.However, Mr Sheridan and others who share his strongly unionist views have questions to answer, not least in outlining which institutions of the British state are worthy of respect. The question is all the more relevant, indeed pressing, considering that the British Prime Minister has shown utter disdain for these institutions, not least that of his own office. This contempt is glaringly obvious when we reflect on the Prime Ministers treatment of Parliament, the monarchy, the courts and very worryingly, devolution.Mr Sheridan goes on to say that our nation is a \"beacon of hope\" in the world Afghans, Iraqis and others may wish to disagree. He also says that when Scotland joined the Union the country was bankrupt. The worst form of bankruptcy is moral bankruptcy, something ubiquitous in the polity Mr Sheridan so admires.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.BALANCING UP DEMOCRACYI WAS astonished by the assertion from Jill Stephensonthat “the same amount of time andmoney” should be spent by those opposing Scottish self-government as by the elected Scottish Government. This implies that she is unaware of the Union Unit which was based in No , and fronted first by Luke Graham, then Oliver Lewis, or the Michael Gove-led Union Directorate. We also have the Union Strategy Committee, sitting above the Gove committee, all employing dozens of people across Whitehall, at substantial taxpayers expense: this without referencing the state propaganda outfit called the “Scottish Office”.All this has been going on for years, while the Scottish Government independence campaign has been in abeyance due to the pandemic. If Ms Stephenson takes off her blinkers, she must admit that the “time and money balancing” should be toward the pro-independence side: anything , as she asserts, is a “denial of justice and democracy”.GR Weir, Ochiltree.FRANCHISE IDEA IS DANGEROUSDOUGLAS McBeanadvocates extending the independence referendum franchise to all non-resident native Scots. That would be legitimatethe franchise were to be based on birth rather than residence but, for consistency, the quid pro quo would require removal of the franchise from any and all Scottish residents who were not Scottish by birth. Such a franchise test might go down well in Brexit-minded jurisdictions, but would surely be the wrong road to go down in an open-minded and welcoming European nation like our own.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.THE CASE FOR PR FOR WESTMINSTERCATRIONA C Clarkgives us a list of the places where the SNP has total dominance in the election of MPs. In doing so, she makes an excellent case for electoral reform at Westminster: it cannot be right that in  the SNP took  per cent of the seats on the basis of % – little over one-third – of the vote.Proportional representation would also have other wholly beneficial effects. It would stop the votes of non-nationalists being wasted and would indeed demonstrate that independence is only supported by a minority of Scottish voters. And at Westminster it would stop the SNP from taking its bogus position as the third party and its accompanying procedural and financial privileges. The only surprising thing is that the Tories and the Labour Party do not support electoral reform And before anyone asks, yes, I did support PR when first past the post disproportionately favoured the Labour Party.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.ARMS SALES MAKE LITTLE SENSEGEORGE Fergusson’s Agenda articlehighlights the UK arms industry.A great many British people are puzzled by and despair when it seems clear that the sheer availability of guns in the United States makes repeated mass killings of innocent citizens inevitable. Yet Britain and France, unlike Germany and Japan, have no compunction about ensuring the ready availability of far more deadly weapons to the Middle East and where, making mass killings on a far greater scale than in the schools and streets of the US also inevitable.Mr Fergusson comments that \"there is little public opposition\" to our continuing arms sales. To find the free availability of weapons to American civilians unacceptable, but to be totally relaxed about our Governments determined supply of deadly armaments throughout the world, makes little sense.Ronald MacLean, Kiltarlity, by Beauly.DONT LET COVID GUARD DOWNBA., the sub-lineage of Omicron, is spreading, as Helen McArdle points out . It is more transmissible than Omicron BA. and has become the dominant iant in Denmark and India. BA.’s arrival in the UK on December  last year, with , cases now identied in England , is a wake-up call.We cannot afford to do away with face masks being worn in schools, on public transport and in indoor spaces. We also need to reinstate social distancing at one or two metres, as BA. is likely to prolong the virus at higher rates into February and March.Humankind will always be vulnerable to Covid iants unless we in the West ensure Covid vaccines are made available worldwide, especially in Africa, where only six per cent of Africans are vaccinated. Big Pharma has to be forced to waive intellectual property rights to Covid vaccines so that developing nations can produce Covid vaccines locally. In this way we can eventually get back to some real sort of normal.Sean Clerkin, Barrhead.Read more: Shame on those who want to abandon the Union for sordid gain"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-scottish-government-needs-take-big-decisions-dysfunctional-calmac-ferry-operation","story":"The second point is that Calmac is not, of itself, “Scotland’s ferry network”, but one of no fewer than  year-round vehicle ferry providers operating in Scottish waters, which collectively carry signicantly more traffic than Calmac. Of these four are local authorities that underwrite any operational deficit. Four are commercial private operators that operate at a profit and are unfunded by the public purse, and in each case provide superior service to comparable state-funded services in terms of capacity, frequency and longer hours of operation. Oneis a commercial management company funded to operate ferries on behalf of the Scottish Government and then there is the state-owned David MacBrayne Group  Calmac, also funded to operate ferries on behalf of the Scottish Government.Bearing in mind the current multiplicity of ferry owning and operational practice in Scotland, there is no fundamental reason why the number of state-funded tenders should be restricted to two. It has often been stated that the large Calmac fleet enables vessels to be replaced easily in the event of breakdown or other disruption. In practice Calmac performs worse in this regard than almost all other Scottish operators, with frequent service disruption and capacity constraints being widely criticised by the communities affected.Of course de-bundling is anathema to the RMT “monopoly”, but the Scottish Government must decide whether the huge and ever-growing sums devoted to one dysal ferry operator is for the benefit and largesse of Calmac’s personnel or the well-being of the communities it purports to serve.Roy Pedersen, Inverness.PUNISHED FOR USING SCOTSHUGH Macdonald’s articlecertainly struck a chord with me regarding the Scottish “cringe” or feelings of inferiority, in particular when it relates to the way we speak. We are all aware of the days when Gaelic-speaking children were punished for using their own first language, but children were also punished for using Scots. Indeed even at home many of us were forbidden to speak anything other than the King’s English.My mother, born in , was brought up to have a lelong disdain for anything Scottish, considering most things as being inferior to English. After my paternal grandmother died, my grandfather came to live with us, and spoke with a broad Arbroath accent. This irritated my mother and she was upset when my speech started to adopt elements of his Angus tongue. So when I was about , she sent me to elocution lessons to “improve” the way I spoke. This was something I detested and something I had to keep from my schoolmates.However, her desire to make me sound “proper” backfired. My elocution teacher was impressed with the timbre of my recently-broken baritone voice and immediately set me to memorise and recite some poems – in Scots. I can still remember my mother’s look of horror when I started reciting “Willie Wastle dwalt on Tweed, the spot they ca’ed it Linkumdoddie. Willie was a wabster gude. Could stown a clue wi ony body”. It wasn’t the misogynistic content of Burns’ poem that bothered her – it was the Scots tongue.Unsurprisingly and to my great relief my lessons came to a rapid end, and to this day, almost  years later, I can still remember Willie Wastle well enough to recite it almost word perfect.Thanks, Rabbie.Neil Scott, Edinburgh.AN EGREGIOUS COMPLAINTI MUST object to the egregious overuse in yours and other areas of the media of the word “egregious”.We must put a stop to this egregious invasion of our language before it becomes too late.Even friends of mine who, until now, have spoken normally have taken to using this word, of which they were not aware until Boris Johnson became Prime Minister.Whilst I do not believe they are using this word egregiously, I believe the egregiousness can be laid at the door of the media whose egregious focusing on a word that sounds more learned than it is is truly egregious.By the way, the word originates from the Latin “egregius” meaning “outstanding”. So I remain, with all due humility, your egregious correspondent.William Thomson, Denny.THE TIRESOME FORWARD THINKINGR RUSSELL Smithdoes well to compose a letter containing so many of Britains endangered sayings.Of equal concern must be the plethora of new sayings now familiar to most of us.Business leaders, politicians and committee men and women never tire of telling us how their new policy will benefit us going forward.

More than halfadmit sustainability has had to take a step back due to Covid-, with the figure rising to two-thirdsof fashion and beauty retailers.The current supply chain crisis also comes to the fore as retailers continue to fight to keep shelves stocked and fulfil online orders. Some % of retailers also say there is a risk that sustainability will fall down their list of prioritiesthe crisis continues.Highlighting the need for sustainability to be embedded from the top down in an organisation, only two-fthsof retailers say the main person responsible for sustainability in their business has “signicant” or “high” influence on company decisions and projects.Sustainability, meanwhile, is also in a “battle of the priorities” with profits, with the vast majorityof retailers saying their shareholders look at profits before sustainability, and % believing that sustainability will never be of equal importance to profit.In addition, % of retailers admit their business sees sustainability more as a cost centre than a cost saver, despite sustainable initiatives – such as shared logistics – having the potential to improve efficiencies, reduce environmental impact and cut costs in the long-term.More positively, over halfof retailers say sustainability is important to their business, and % say it has moved up the agenda over the last year, while % say their approach to sustainability is becoming less organic and more strategic. Three-quartershave announced sustainability improvements, one-fthare giving customers a choice between standard and sustainable deliveries, and % have launched a new line of sustainable products separate from their standard offering.The increasingly high-profile area of rental and resale also comes to the fore, with % of fashion and beauty retailers and % of retailers in the lestyle and leisure sectors launching their own rental or resale service.Howard Beach, partner at TLT, comments: “Our research reveals just how vulnerable sustainability is to other priorities facing the retail sector at the moment. “These other pressures – like the supply chain crisis and staff shortages – are likely to continue for some time, so there’s an urgent need to find a way of balancing these demands. Retailers need to appoint people with the right expertise who can set the right strategy and oversee its implementation. They need to have credibility and a voice that is heard at the highest levels of the business.“At the same time, this isn’t something that can fall to just one person or team. It needs to be part of how the business operates, and people need clear communication and support in their roles. Simply put, sustainability cannot afford to lose this battle of the priorities to the extent that it has done for a quarter of retailers over the last year.”Meanwhile, just % of retailers – and % of grocers – are “very confident” they will meet the expectations of the Competition and Markets Authoritywhen it investigates misleading green claims this year.The finding comes as % of retailers say they are under pressure to make their position on sustainability more visible, and % are becoming more vocal about their sustainability credentials – despite % admitting it’s impossible for retailers to knowthey’re doing enough to say they’re sustainable.TLT’s Sustainability Matters – putting the “eco” in retail economics report identies three types of retailer:The report also highlights the fact that the biggest pressure to be more sustainable is coming from the Government and regulators , closely followed by customers , shareholders investorsand the media . Some % of retailers are becoming more vocal about their sustainability credentials, while just one-fthhave taken the bold move to position themselves as a “sustainable business”.Highlighting the growing legal risks associated with green claims, three-quartersof retailers say customers misunderstand claims about sustainability, while one-fthsuggest they do so “often”.TLT’s research also reveals that many retailers are signicantly more concerned about the PR risksof “greenwashing” than the legal risks, with only % worried about civil claims and % worried about regulatory prosecutions.According to retailers, the biggest barrier to preventing greenwashing is competing priorities , followed by the time it takes to do what’s neededand a lack of budget .One-quarterof retailers blame a lack of accepted benchmarks and definitions for terms such as “green”, “ethical” and “sustainable”, while one-fth blame a lack of in-house skillsand a lack of board-level support for sustainability .Mr Beach points out that the messaging from the CMA has been very clear. “The CMA has already announced that it is prioritising the fashion industry as part of its full-scale review this year,\" he notes.“The review should be a concern for all retailers who arenot only promoting their own businesses but also repeating or relying on the sustainability claims of their suppliers. Retailers who haven’t already done so need to familiarise themselves with the CMA’s Green Claims Code and its list of  questions. “They should review their internal procedures to identy where the risks might be and what changes might be needed.” www.tltsolicitors "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13433027.jpg?type=article-full","title":"actor-podcaster-nicola-roy-shares-favourite-things-scotland","story":"I think of Gullane in East Lothian straight away. A beautul sandy beach backed by high sand dunes close to the quaint village of Gullane. East Lothian is a lovely area. It’s a beach we would always go as children, a little escape from Edinburgh when needed. And sometimes you spot a famous golfer or two!BEST BUILDINGThe Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh is a beautul, old building with the castle as a backdrop. Inside, the grandeur of the chandelier, velvet seating and the classic proscenium arch stage always takes my breath away. This is where I was first mesmerised by the magic of theatre as a child. I joined their youth theatre and watched incredible talents such as Siobhan Redmond as Miss Jean Brodie. I have performed there many times and now I am proud to have my podcast The Cultural Coven, in association with it.BEST STREETTechnically it’s a th century close and not a street, but Lady Stairs Close is one of the secret little streets in Edinburgh’s Old Town. I love the juxtaposition of views one side on to the Royal Mile and the other on to the New Town. The unique, rickety buildings in the court are quintessentially old Edinburgh, it’s easy to feel the history of the city.BEST CHILDHOOD MEMORYDefinitely the girls’ trips to Nairn with my mum, grandma and sister in the holidays to visit my mum’s cousin Ian who owned the Braeval Hotel. The drive was always hilarious, my grandma map reading, getting it all wrong, while my mum would be playing Motown CDs. We’d have a pit-stop in Pitlochry, and venture into the old-fashioned sweetie shops. My mum would take us to explore castles and palaces. She died far too young but I’ve inherited her sense of adventure.BEST WALK OR CYCLEI live right by the Pentland Hills but when I was a child and we were on a drive, I would spot them from the motorway and immediately feel at home. I walk from the Bonaly side and you get the most incredible views over Edinburgh. You pass reservoirs, horses and even Highland cows just roaming free. You can walk for hours. I can see my old school from there and my grandma’s old house and right across to Fe. And they now even have a little café up there!BEST VIEWIt’s Sligachan Old Bridge up looking on to the Cuillins behind it and the apparently enchanted waters below it. I hadn’t been to Skye until the pandemic struck but I’ve since been three times and it has become a place of solace for me. I think this view is even more magical and mysterious when surrounded by the mist. It’s almost unfathomable that these huge mountains are on a small island.Legend has it that faeries live at Slighachan, I believe it but I’m not sure my boyfriend is convinced… yet.BEST SHOPThere are two shops that it’s impossible to choose between. Totty Rocks in Edinburgh is cool – they work with tartan and tweed in a modern way. Their designs are a clever, modern twist on nostalgic looks.Then Toys Galore in Edinburgh. An independent toy store that is an Edinburgh institution in Morningside. Toys you might think were now extinct are there. It felt special to visit as a child and even now to buy gts for children.BEST SCOTTISH DELICACYI’m not sure a drink is a delicacy butit was, it would be a peaty whisky. I ADORE it. A storytelling drink for the end of the night a cuddle in a glass.Food is all about context. I’m not a huge seafood fan but it’s hard to beat scallops at the Oyster Shed on Skye. I was there with my Canadian boyfriend a couple of weeks ago and those views on to the loch while standing round a barrel eating freshly cooked seafood feels special.BEST PLACE FOR A CUPPACaoro Dhubh Coffee Company in Carbost on Skye is this little hut that does the best coffee from the independent scene, right on Loch Harport in Carbost. It’s got a good focus on ethical trading too. It’s hard to think of a more unique location – one view is to the Talisker distillery and one is on to the water. When the sun shines and you sit at a wee table outside there is nothing better.BEST PLACE FOR ALONE TIMEFor me Braidburn Valley Park in Edinburgh is a peaceful, oasis. It’s  minutes’ walk from my house and where I go to learn linesI need a change of scene. I strongly associate it with being a little girl.My mum and dad would take us sledging there, and I would get lost in the Maisie the Morningside Cat books or the play The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I want to also commend the Head Teacher and her team for stepping up in these dficult circumstances.”Despite a relaxation of restrictions nationwide, it remains vital for everyone to continue carrying out lateral flow tests and to report the result, whether positive, negative or void here: https:www.nhsinform.scot # coronavirus-covid-#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up. We are looking forward to helping the team as they prove how to install, operate and maintain their exciting machine in Orkney’s harsh conditions.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD .

He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear.

The CEO’s salary is set by the remuneration and performance committee which is made up of three members of the board, known as the Council. All of our board members are volunteers.”Unicef Ireland’s director, Peter Power, has an annual salary of €, , while St Vincent de Paul’s national director , Andy Heffernan, brings home between €, and €, Agnes Lunny is the chief executive of learning disability charity Positive Futures, based in Northern Ireland, and Positive Futures Ireland, based in the Republic.Her combined salary for both roles is £, annually.In her response to this newspaper request, Ms Lunny said: “My average working week across both roles is + hours, more often than not  hours. That puts my hourly pay at between £ and £.“My salary was recently increased following a benchmarking exercise against similar roles in Health  Social Care.”All-Ireland wellbeing charity Inspire’s chief executive, Kerry Anthony, has an annual salary of between £, and £,. An Inspire spokesperson said: “You will see from our accounts that our income mostly comes from contracts for services with very little coming from donations from the public. Any donations we do get from the public to support our work go straight to the projects for which they are raised and don’t contribute to the pay of our CEO.”Ulster Unionist MLA Andy Allen, a member of Stormont’s Communities Committee, said he can understand why some may be concerned by charity bosses taking in large salaries, however the signicant amount of work they undertake must be taken into account.“The structure and complexity of modern charities require leadership and ability at the highest levels to ensure the organisation is managed effectively to deliver vital support services for their beneficiaries,” he said.“While I understand fully the public concern that salaries of some charity chief executives are over £,, it is important to recognise the experience and skills required to run an organisation that employs hundreds of people, manages millions of pounds of public money and donations — delivering vital services to our most needy and vulnerable.If an inidual could earn more in a similar position in the private sector, as is the case in many of these examples, then how can our charities attract the best and most qualied leaders to ensure services to those most in need are deliveredthey are not offering a comparable salary that recognises the skills and experience needed ”In December , it emerged that the then-Communities Minister Caral Ni Chuilin had commissioned an independent review of the Charity Commission, following a report by senior civil servant Jonathan Baume looking at how the Department for Communities handled complaints in relation to the Commission.Responding to an Assembly question about the Baume report’s recommendations by TUV leader Jim Allister at the time, Ms Ni Chuilin said: “The former Head of the Civil Servicecommissioned a review into how the Department for Communities had handled a number of complaints from a member of the public in relation to the Charity Commission.“HOCS asked my Department to respond to the suggestions set out in the review. These are currently being progressed, including consideration of the Department’s role as the custodian of charity regulation law and policy and sponsor for the Commission.“The Department’s Head of Governance has also written to the Chief Commissioner to seek assurances in relation to matters highlighted in the Review.“In order to restore public confidence in a system that has undoubtedly been damaged, I have also decided to commission an independent review of charity regulation including a review of the performance of the Charity Commission in its role as statutory regulator.”Related topicsAndy AllenJim AllisterDepartment for CommunitiesMore On Andy Allen PremiumViewpointOpinionCharities must look at sky-high salaries PremiumShock figures show  died while waiting for place to call home last year PremiumDurkan ‘shocked’ that Stormont minister ed almost £m in funding PremiumQuestions raised after Justice Department s £m to Finance Department as PSNI faces budget shortfall PremiumHousing Executive owns more than  acres of unused land while, people on homes waiting listMost ReadCondolences offered to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following the death of his brother AndrewRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverRevealed: The Northern Ireland charity chief paid as much as the First MinistersIrish League grounds will be closedcrowd trouble continues: IFA warning is ‘not an idle threat’End of an era as Burger King set to move from its Belfast city centre locationTop VideosPlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere PlayPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsPlayVideo: End of an era as Burger King set to move from Belfast city centre locationLatest Northern IrelandUnion Flag will not fly over Belfast City Hall on Prince Andrew’s birthday‘Degree of absurdity’ in two rival climate change bills at Stormont – AikenBelfast City Council Live: Union flag will not be flown to mark Prince Andrew#s birthdayNew law bans smoking in cars with children in Northern IrelandSurvivors of historical abuse want radical change for compensation paymentsLatestGraham Nash joins artists removing their music from SpotyUnion Flag will not fly over Belfast City Hall on Prince Andrew’s birthdayCourtney Lawes and Jonny Hill ruled out of England’s Six Nations openerWinner of  Costa Book of the Year award namedCMO to tell Health Committee of ‘ongoing need’ for Covid- measures,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is only right that their sacrices are recognised.”She added: “Creating the first public holiday on the island of Ireland named after a woman would also be signicant.“We have heard much discourse in recent weeks and months about the role Irish women play in our society and the need to challenge outdated and misogynistic attitudes.“There is a need for greater equality and parity and I think naming a bank holiday after St Brigid, the female patron saint of Ireland, would send a powerful message about how far we have come, but recognise the work still to be done.”In a statement to the Belfaston whether they would consider the proposal, a UK Government spokesman said: “The current pattern of public and bank holidays is well established and whilst an additional bank holiday may benefit some communities and sectors, the cost to the economy of an additional bank holiday is considerable.”Related topicsCara HunterMore On Cara Hunter‘Unfit for purpose’: MLAs hit out over sex education in NI schoolsStabbing of Limavady teenager condemned, as ‘close-knit area’ left in shock PremiumFools on the rules: From Rita Ora and Nathan Carter to Kay Burley and Dominic Cummings – some of the famous figures who bent or outright broke Covid restrictionsGood cause: MLA Cara finishes her swimathon for Women’s AidSDLP MLA Cara Hunter swimming mile a day for Women’s Aid after brain tumour diagnosisMost ReadCondolences offered to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following the death of his brother AndrewRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverRevealed: The Northern Ireland charity chief paid as much as the First MinistersIrish League grounds will be closedcrowd trouble continues: IFA warning is ‘not an idle threat’End of an era as Burger King set to move from its Belfast city centre locationTop VideosPlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere PlayPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsPlaySir Keir Starmer urges Tory MPs to make decision on Johnson#s futureLatest Northern IrelandUnion Flag will not fly over Belfast City Hall on Prince Andrew’s birthday‘Degree of absurdity’ in two rival climate change bills at Stormont – AikenBelfast City Council Live: Union flag will not be flown to mark Prince Andrew#s birthdayNew law bans smoking in cars with children in Northern IrelandSurvivors of historical abuse want radical change for compensation paymentsLatestGraham Nash joins artists removing their music from SpotyUnion Flag will not fly over Belfast City Hall on Prince Andrew’s birthdayCourtney Lawes and Jonny Hill ruled out of England’s Six Nations openerWinner of  Costa Book of the Year award namedCMO to tell Health Committee of ‘ongoing need’ for Covid- measures,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

The winning schools each received pound of NIFQA beef and lamb, kindly sponsored by ABP Food Group.Livestock and Meat Commission education and consumer promotions manager, Sarah Toland, explained that one of the key drivers for the competition was to encourage the use of NIFQA beef and lamb in schools and to complement the organisationrsquos existing schools programme.ldquoWith this in mind we specically targeted food and nutrition teachers and their students when drawing up the criteria for the project, she said.Sarah congratulated the winning schools, noting that as the competition received an encouraging number of entries, to select the top three was no easy task.De La Salle teacher Irene Stokes said the competition helped increase awareness of the importance of sourcing local NIFQA produce.She added: ldquoThis competition allowed our students an opportunity to highlight the vital nutrients that beef and lamb provide and how both can add iety, colour,flavour and texture to any dish. ldquoOur students are also becoming increasingly aware of sourcing meats that have the NIFQA symbol and the impact this has on the local economy.Down High teacher Sharon McKee said the competition was a ldquofabulous way of encouraging students to consider the valuable contribution of red meat in their diet.She added: ldquoOur Year  pupils are currently investigating the nutritional and dietary needs of adolescence so this competition fitted well into our curriculum and brought the theory to le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Downe.jpg","title":"Downe partnership to help map future  ","story":"THE first meeting of a new forum involving health chiefs, hospital campaigners, trade unions and politicians to oversee service provision at the Downe hospital is expected to take place in the spring.The South Eastern Trust mdash which is responsible for the hospital and the delivery of a raft of health and social services across the community mdash has described the creation of the new Downe Health and Care Partnership Forum as exciting.Last summer, South Down MP Chris Hazzard suggested to senior health chiefs that a new partnership involving a range of key players should be established to help map out the most appropriate model of health care for the area and it will soon become a reality.Health chiefs said the forum, which is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, said the two key objectives are to plan for the future with everyone who uses services in the area and work in partnership to improve the health and wellbeing of the community.The health trust said this is in line with the organisationrsquos so-called ldquoquality  all strategy which puts excellent care at the centre of what it does.Officials say the new forum will consider local population health and social care needs, support people to lead healthier lives and take action to reduce health inequalities.Health trust chief executive, Roisin Coulter, said the organisation wants to work collaboratively with the local community regarding existing health and social care services to plan and design for the future.ldquoWorking in partnership with a wide range of key stakeholders will be vital to the forumrsquos success.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in . It took over the vacant Albion clothing factory on the Antrim Road and at one point last year was employing  people.The number has been whittled away and will be reduced to  employees.The other two major employers have also been hit over the last four years. The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service.

Surveys have shown more people go racing on a Sunday than on any other day, he remarked.ldquoYet the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture last November rejected the appeals of deputations representation Downpatrick and Down Royal seeking an equal opportunity.Mr Duff said thatSunday racing is permitted, the law relating to gambling would have to be changed.Mr Duff added: ldquoEverybody in racing respects the views of people who may be against Sunday racing, but I donrsquot think they should be allowed to dictate to the majority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Matt.jpg","title":"Matthew survives on Dancing With The Stars  ","story":"LOVE Islander Matthew MacNabb survived the first public vote in RTErsquos Dancing With The Stars mdash despite gaining the lowest number of points.The Downpatrick man was faced with the challenge of dancing the jive on Sundayrsquos show, known to be notoriously dficult for tall male dancers.Standing at ft in, the  year-old admitted it was tough going, but was personally delighted with his effort with professional dance partner Laura Nolan.Speaking from Dublin on Monday, Matthew told the Recorder: ldquoI was happy with my dance last night as I had a nightmare with it all week trying to get the timing and coordination down.ldquoThat was the best I danced it and I worked so hard all week but I guess giraffes arenrsquot meant to jive.In the end, it was novelist Cathy Kelly who was the first celebrity to leave the show.The local GAA player and digital marketing consultant said he had been overwhelmed by the support and votes he had received.He said: ldquoTo be bottom and to get through shows how amazing people are to vote for me and I really appreciate it.

But then Don upped the pressure and the hosts dominated thefinal ends to run out - winners.On the other mat the home triple of Hilary Cavan, Robin Horner and Graham Christie were playing some great bowls against Paddy Murray and after lting a count of six on the third end would only lose three ends in their - win. At the break the home side had a -shot overall lead.The Saints made a slight comeback in the third game as Philip Woodside, David Anderson and Neil Brown continued their good run of form against Frances and Derek McCann and skip Alan Laughlin, who after losing the first two ends won the next three to go - up before Alan hit back to make it it - after seven ends.This would be as good as it would get as the visitors won the last three ends to finish - winners to secure the only away points of the match.A mention must go to this triple for playing and controlling this game so well, especially as Philip had a throwback to past times with the quality of lead bowls.The last game of the night saw Rose Marie Wylie, Davy Vance and Peter Christie score seven shots from the first two ends against Terry Quinn, Nigel Brown and Tony Ward.They never relinguished this lead as the game finished - in their favour to secure another great win.Surely now no-one can stop Spa from continuing on and finish the season unbeaten and as champions.DROMARA.....................

Dromararsquos Denis Kane, Richard Kelly and JamesMcKinney took control of their game against Haydn Tumelty, Dermot Rooney and Liam Higgins and even though they won only four ends and scored  shots to win -, this left Dromara with a five-shot lead in the overall.Owenbeg finally got going in the final game as Nathan Tumelty, Alan Telford and Collie Gibson really put Marie McNeill, Phil and Eamon Kelly to the sword.They only let their opponents score two shots as they scored steadily and heavily to run out victors by a - margin.It has to be said that Nathan was giving his team-mates an easy time with his standard of lead bowls on what are tricky mats.This win was enough to get Owenbeg the extra points and scrape an overall draw.ST MACARTANrsquoS...........

How are your New Year resolutions going How many times do you decide to lsquostop thisrsquo, lsquostart thatrsquo, and find a few weeks later that you have blown it and feel guilty and frustrated with yourself Starting all over again on the back of frustration and then pushing yourself even harder, making it increasingly dficult to stick to your resolution Breaking habits or quitting something on the surface seem like great ideas when wanting to improve your health and well-being. Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them. To get the cogs in motion,answer yes or no to the following questions:Do you find it hard to say no Do you find it dficult to take a compliment Do you criticise yourself often Do you compare yourself to others Do you worry about what others think about you How many were answered lsquoyesrsquo Maybe after everything that we all have been through over the last couple of years,  has the possibility to be the year that you remember as the year you began to take control, to recover and heal.  could be the year when you started loving yourself more.There are three elements that I would like to introduce today that are to be consideredyou want to feel empowered and active in real self-care.AwarenessAwareness begins with the practice of noticing. It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times. If you feel that you like to find out more about ways of real self care, developing good habits and creating change, you can contact me on  .For the month of January, I am offering free -minute assessment sessions.

Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle. However, concern remains about the dangerous speeds that continue to be recorded with some drivers showing a blatant disregard for the speed limits in place.The highest speed recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick was mph in the mph zone at am, with  drivers detected travelling at over mph. Previous speeds recorded at the built-up area have peaked at mph.Residents in the built-up area, which includes a signicant number of houses, a nursing home and local authority depot, have continually expressed concern about the speed of drivers who use the busy road and argue that the speed sign needs to be relocated further back towards the Lecale Park entrance.The highest speed recorded at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan was mph at am, with  drivers recorded travelling in excess of mph, with % of drivers detected travelling between mph and mph.Elsewhere, one driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Dundrum Road in Clough at am, with one driver clocked driving in excess of mph.In Killyleagh, a driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone on the approach to the townrsquos Integrated Primary School, with  drivers clocked at over mph.

The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry.

She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare. Her remains were brought to Downpatrick for reasons of safety at the time of the Viking raids on monasteries and reburied with those of St Patrick and St Colmcille at Down Cathedral.To book a place at pound for one of talks visit https:www.saintpatrickcentre friends saint-brigids-day-experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13225887.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I took up art, I did it for about a year and that was the end of that.“Then about five years ago, my sister’s husband had died and we were clearing out the house. I found that she’d kept all of the sketches I’d done when I was  in an envelope. “I started looked at them, messing around with them, I bought some paints and started colouring them in.Clubsound in the s. PACEMAKER PRESS BELFAST“The nights I wasn’t working I was painting. In two years I must have done about  paintings for people.“It’s a blessing for me, it kept me sane, when you play every week and suddenly you stop, it hits you hard.“It relieved the boredom, it gave me something to focus on, when a painting turned out successful you felt you’d achieved something.“My biggest satisfaction is that I’ve painted memories for people that are now hanging in their house.George Jones started and finished his radio career with Downtown. Picture by CHARLES MCQUILLAN PACEMAKER.“It’s another sense of entertainment I suppose, another string to my bow. If my sister hadn’t kept those sketches I wouldn’t have all of this.”George recalled his sister’s influence on his musical career: “The first two records my sister brought in that started me on music when I was about nine or  were Little Richard ‘Long Tall Sally’ and Elvis ‘All Shook Up’. “In those days it wasn’t vinyl, it was  bakelite – it looked the same as vinyl butyou’d dropped it, it would have smashed. “I listened to them non-stop and then she bought me my first guitar at .”George said he formed skfle groups with boys of his age in the Bloomfield area of east Belfast. One of them was Van Morrison, whom George went on to tour with as The Monarchs.He said: “I go to lunch with Van Morrison quite a lot. The Monarchs were the first band to go to Germany. We had a hit record in  when the Beatles were still hovering around Germany.“Van has been trying to find the rights to it to repress it and put it out as a single on vinyl. I sung on it and he played saxophone – a bit of rock and roll.”George, who has been part of the successful ‘Do You Come Here Often ’ and ‘Rock ‘n Roll Years and Dance Hall Days’ shows, started learning the guitar at . He believes that might be the magic number: “I’ve interviewed so many people in my years on the radio who started the exact same way. “I’m hesitant to ask when they started to play the guitar – it’s always . So many great guitarists I interviewed, the likes of Hank B Marvin, started at .”Having found his first chords at  George is still going strong at .He said: “For me it’s been an incredible le, just when you think it’s all over, Clubsound have found a new lease of le.“We’ve found out that young people have started listening to the albums their parents have. I hesitate to use the term, but you become a cult.“Young ones come up to me and say ‘Yeoooo, Shankill Airways, my mum plays that all the time’.”George said the state modern music meant that people are yearning for songs from bygone days, especially the fties and sixties: “It was real music, there was no electronics – it was guitars, live drums, you were getting the whole live vibe.“In our day you just piled in, there was no such thing as tickets, you paid at the door and they squeezed in as many as they could.That added to the experience.”George plans to publish his memoirs as a book. In it he plans to recount his first meetings with Rory Gallagher and an incredibly green Gary Moore, of whom he told his father, ‘that wee lad will never be a guitar player’.‘It took a long time but I’m now over shock exit from Radio Ulster’George said that when he made his radio debut with Downtown his plan wasn’t to dilute his Clubsound persona too much.He said: “I used to bring what I did on stage onto the radio. I used to bring these we characters like Sadie that I did the voices for – she got more mail that I did. Radio needs to entertain,you’re on for two hours you’re not just sitting there spinning dics, you have to draw people in.”It wasn’t long before George was snapped up by Radio Ulster where he delivered ‘Just Jones’ for an amazing  years. Then one fateful day he was told he was surplus to requirements despite his popularity.George said: “People come up to me to this day, saying, ‘we miss you on the raido’ and ‘why did they do that to you’. “It was a big change in my le, it brought me down to earth more than anything. I thought those days were over – about two more times before that we were down and out and started over again, especially after the Miami thing and in South Africa my son nearly died of typhoid.“There were downs, but this was one I didn’t expect. I felt I was doing a good job.“During my six month notice period the public lted me to heights I never would believe. On the last week I was there I got nearly , emails from all over the world. I walked out of there about  feet tall. That was the bonus.”He said: “My we and family have helped me put it behind me. It took a long time because I was hurting.“I took up U with good success. It was water under the bridge and I had to put it under the bridge. I finished up in Downtown where I’d started in the s. Then I said to myself, radio is changing but it’s time for me to step aside.“When I look back now at radio in general, it’s like looking back to the wonder years of music, it saddens me – why has it changed so much  The commercial radio stations are just advertising boards with bits of music. “The word entertainment has disappeared from broadcasting. You couldn’t sit and listen to a radio show for two hours now, whereas before you’d have people would have been glad of that two hours of company.”Asked who he listens to on the ‘wireless’ George said: “Ken Bruce is still one of the old school and he makes me laugh. He still plays the oldies. Steve Wright still plays oldies. Asides from that it’s Classic FM.“It breaks my heart but I wouldn’t listen to any local radio stations.”Where to see George and Clubsound in actionClubsound’s current line-up of George Jones, David McKnight, Barry Woods, Alan McCartney and Jimmy Black will be on the road this spring including gigs at Theatre at The Mill in Newtownabbey on Saturday, March , Armagh’s Market Place Theatre on Saturday, April  and the Portico Arts and Heritage Centre in Portaferry on Monday, April . There will also be a gig at the Millennium Forum in Londonderry on Thursday, November .

This increase will see the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter rise by about pound per year to pound,. Those customerswith a prepayment gas metercosts will increase by around pound per year to pound,. The Ten TownsareaincludesAntrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Craigavon ,Limavady,Derry-Londonderry, Newry and more than other towns and villages in the surrounding areas. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “The Utility Regulator forewarned us that energy price rises of this nature will continue because of exceptionally high global wholesale gas prices, however it is never good news for consumers when prices go up. This is going to put extreme pressure on many households as they try to pay their gas bills. “With the cost of energy continuing to increase, the Consumer Council is concerned about a potential rise in fuel poverty as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “We welcome firmus energy’s commitment to assist some of our most vulnerable consumers through support for the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme, but it is clear that energy companies including firmus, policy makers, The Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high fuel prices will be with us for years.” Consumers who are struggling with their energy bills or topping up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support. Consumers can also get in touch with the Consumer Council for free, independent advice by calling Freephone    or by emailingcontact@consumercouncil.org.uk. The Consumer Council’s websitehas a number of free resources includingSwitch On: A Guide for Home Energy Users,which helps consumers be more energy efficient at home, get the best from their electricity or gas supply, and save money. firmus energy customers in Greater Belfast and in the gas to the West network area will not be impacted by this tarf change.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cefabcabfbbbedd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdbbfebef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
