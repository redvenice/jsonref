Let me try that out.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s like the only way I feel like I can repay what has essentially been a giant gift in my life.\u0027Top honor: On Monday, Chris Pratt, 38, received the MTV Movie \u0026amp TV Generation AwardPratt dismissed the idea that talking so openly about his faith, particularity at a non-religious event, could be a risk in Hollywood. \u0027I think that there\u0027s this narrative that exists out there that Hollywood is anti-Christian or anti-religious, but it\u0027s just not the case,\u0027 he said.\u0027They are kind of not anti-anything. They are kind of pro whatever is authentic to you. \u0027And I like that. Because it\u0027s authentic for me to be pro-Christian, pro-Jesus. That\u0027s my thing. I like it. \u0027And I\u0027ve never had anyone try to shame me, to my face. Maybe they go say it behind my back. But if that\u0027s the case, go ahead. You can say whatever you want about me - to my face or behind my back. I\u0027m not going to change.\u0027Aside from his Christianity, Pratt said that exercise way a major motivator in his life.     The couple that exercise together: Chris Pratt, 39, and girlfriend  Katherine Schwarzenegger, 28, were spotted out for a walk on a sunny Saturday in Los Angeles           Old love: Chris with his wife of eight years, actress Anna Faris, and their son Jack, six , at his Hollywood star ceremony in 2017. They filed for orce last DecemberThe interview with The Associated Press, took place after Michelob Ultra, which Pratt is a spokesman for, announced it was sponsoring seven athletes with disabilities, part of the nonprofit group Achilles International, to run in the New York City Marathon. \u0027It\u0027s hard enough to do a marathon or to do a triathlon. But to do it when you have physical limitations and disabilities, it\u0027s pretty awe-inspiring,\u0027 he said, adding that fitness is \u0027a great common denominator.\u0027The 39-year-old actor, who enjoys biking, running and ocean swimming when at his farm in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state, says that he feels he was \u0027genetically made for... moving refrigerators or something.\u0027\u0027But now I\u0027m doing a job that really isn\u0027t that physically demanding. So having something that I can just shut my mind off and do physically every day is good for me.\u0027The Jurassic World actor added that he is a little self-conscious about his running skills, after breaking his leg as a child left one of his legs crooked, and so he was in awe of actors like Tom Cruise who could sprint flawlessly on screen and did their own stunts.\u0027When I run, I run a little crooked. And if I run at top speed, there\u0027s a high likelihood I will fall down,\u0027 he said.\u0027Tom Cruise. \u0027Mission: Impossible\u0027 - he ran across London, across bridges, over buildings. Yeah, Tom is a great runner. He did all his own jumping, he was flying the helicopter, he really was like - oh, if there\u0027s a question of whether or not I\u0027m the best at this, let me put that question to bed. He\u0027s the best.\u0027But it was Cruise\u0027s reputation that Pratt said he most admired.          The 39-year-old actor, who enjoys biking, running and ocean swimming when at his farm in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state          Pratt has erected crosses on his land \u0027One of the career goals that I have based on Tom Cruise is his reputation as being a really nice, positive guy who works hard. I\u0027ve never actually met him, but I would like - if you\u0027re going to leave a legacy, it\u0027d be nice to have it be that people thought you were nice and easy to work with and you worked hard. I think that\u0027s pretty cool.\u0027Prat split from his wife Anna Faris last year, but has found love again in Katherine Schwarzenegger, 28.They came out as a couple in June and have been spotted enjoying a sunny Saturday day in Los Angeles last weekend.Proving that couple that exercises together stays together, they enjoyed a walk. At one point the beautiful 28-year-old daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and his ex-wife Maria Shriver reached out to lovingly stroke her beau\u0027s arm. Chris and Katherine are reportedly serious, a source dished to People, even though they\u0027ve only been together a few months \u0027They\u0027re both serious about the relationship and hopeful for the future,\u0027 the source revealed. \u0027Chris doesn\u0027t just date to date, and neither does Katherine.

The Government’s new transparent approach to these projections should prevent this abuse.‘However, we hope that the Government will provide more detail on how these figures should be used – to determine which houses should be built to best meet people’s needs and where – to ensure we make the best use of suitable brownfield land and reduce huge pressure on our countryside.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Bees removed ceiling private accommodation","story":"    Up to 40,000 bees were removed from a ceiling in Brighton after they moved in in 2017  The comb was cut away from the ceiling and put into frames so they could re-use them\u0027We were quite surprised as we continued to remove more plasterboard that the comb just kept going.\u0027He added: \u0027The bees were safely removed, despite a number of stings, and they have been relocated to our Sussex apiary where they\u0027re now in a new hive for them to re-establish.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s very rare that we\u0027ll get a call to an established honey bee colony, especially of this size.\u0027The hive was about 1.6m long and 30cm wide, with honey comb two inches thick in places.

Graphic novelist and judge Shapton said it was the \u0027eco-epic of the year and perhaps the decade\u0027.The judges responded to the inclusion of non-UK authors with chair Appiah saying they \u0027do not check writers\u0027 passports\u0027 but simply read the books.In 2013, aged 28, New Zealander Eleanor Catton was previously the youngest winner of the £50,000 prize for her novel The Luminaries.The Man Booker Prize for fiction was first awarded in 1969 and the winner will be announced on October 16.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Hilarious moment hungry red squirrel pushes tiny supermarket trolley","story":"    It\u0027s a cracker!

Orla Kiely, pictured in 2014, said she started the company while she was caring for her newborn son, RobertThe designer has collaborated with Heal\u0027s, the Tate and Harrods and her fashion brand has become a favourite among royals.  Kate Middleton has been seen wearing the label\u0027s dresses on several occasions, for example in February this year when she wore a floral outfit to London\u0027s National Portrait Gallery. Her sister Pippa has also used the brand, wearing a Kiely cardigan when she watched tennis at Wimbledon with her brother, while Carole Middleton wore a blue printer Orla Kiely dress when she went to visit the newborn Prince George in 2013. Ms Kiely and her husband Dermott Rowan, 60, who started the business from a first-floor flat in London, remained its directors.      The company, which Irish designer Orla Kiely founded with her husband Dermott, was known for its colourful floral pieces (pictures posed by models)             A selection of Orla Kiely-designed items including handbags and cushions seen in London     Radios and garden chairs were among the items to feature an Orla Kiely floral designMr Rowan helped to run the financial side of the business while Ms Kiely focused on designing, she said. She would look over the designs herself with her handwritten word \u0027approved\u0027 written on numerous drawings at a recent exhibition.Describing her personal style she said that \u0027colour and pattern are at the heart of everything\u0027. After taking a degree in print for fashion, she took an MA in knitwear at the Royal College of Art and later worked as a consultant with Marks \u0026amp Spencer In 2010, she featured on an Irish postage stamp, and in 2011 she was awarded an OBE.

The flower-like graphic she created in the Nineties became the company logo and featured on almost every product she made — most iconically on the line of laminated handbags which propelled her to fame.Her prints and patterns also made their way onto womenswear, with the Orla Kiely clothing line worn by everyone from Alexa Chung to Kirsten Dunst, but particularly championed by the royals.  Although Orla Kiely\u0027s prints are a royal favourite (pictured left Carole Middleton and right Kate Middleton) they had become \u0027licensed too widely\u0027 meaning the graphic prints were on everything from £300 dresses to £2 hand towelsIn fact, her prints became so reconisable that she was recently celebrated in an exhibition at the Fashion and Textiles Museum in London.But this signature also was her undoing.You know the feeling of turning up to a party and someone\u0027s wearing the same dress as you? For a while you didn\u0027t need to be at a party to find an Orla Kiely print — you\u0027d match your friend\u0027s kettle, or the car in their driveway. Because Orla licensed her print too far and it started to appear on everything - from £30 blinds to £7.49 coasters to £2 hand towels. Those graphic prints were everywhere on everything, and women simple didn\u0027t want the same print on their biscuit tins and their blouse - it appeared on the back of buses and even a Citroen DS3. Because the prints never changed, too, you\u0027d also never want or need to replace that biscuit tin, or those blinds or towels.The pity is that her clothes were beautiful, mainly thoughtfully cut dresses and shirts in pretty feminine prints. But they were too expensive for what they were — £300 for a black smock dress was typical — when you know you could buy a cushion bearing the same print for a fraction of that.  Orla licensed her print too widely, with the blocky 1970s designs featuring on £30 blinds to £7.49 coasters and £2 hand towels  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/20/00/506D61DB00000578-0-image-a-20_1537401216328.jpg","title":"America worlds LARGEST oil producer","story":"    America is the world\u0027s top oil producer after overtaking Saudi Arabia earlier this year and outpacing Russia at some point over the summer, analysts predictThe figures are based on preliminary estimates published by the US Energy Information Administration last week.If confirmed, it would mark the first time since 1973 that the US has topped world rankings. One-third of households in the United States struggle to pay...A staggering 44.6 PER CENT of calls made in 2019 will come...Share this articleThe agency said it expects the US to hold its position at the top of the chart for the remaining months of 2018 and throughout 2019.After languishing at less than 6million barrels of oil per month between 2000 and 2011, American oil production began rapidly increasing from 2012 onwards.That figure has now almost doubled in the last six years, though there was a dip between 2014 and early 2016 when the price of crude plunged and oil companies were forced to scale back operations.

I’m not sure how true it is, but I think that regardless of whether he did do it or not, it’s one of those albums that mixes very traditional Caribbean approaches to music and jazz.Saxophone player Cedric “Im” Brooks features really prominently throughout the album, and hearing him play, it’s like Rastafari devotional music but with jazz improvisation and spoken word on it. There’s a lot of historical chanting, talking about aspects of history like Jamaican colonisation and the independence movement. And it was the first time I’d heard an album that had all of these things: traditional aspect as the basis of it, the nyabinghi rhythm, the very advanced jazz soloing in the midst of all this, and spoken word that reminds you of Gil Scott-Heron.Even before I started Sons of Kemet, I was listening to it constantly. It wasn’t that I wanted to replicate the music specifically, but to replicate the atmosphere of the music, not as a commodity but almost for a devotional purpose. I was influenced by the atmosphere of it – I want to make something as epic as this sounds, in the same spirit. When I’m writing for Sons of Kemet, I want to write music that is in some way connected to the past, but is in some way looking forward.Shortlisted Hyundai Mercury Prize album: A Fever DreamAlbum that inspired me: The White Album (1968) by the BeatlesPicking The White Album by the Beatles is not very original, but it’s a big fat classic. This album has a sense of amazing creativity. I remember reading that Paul McCartney said that when they wrote together, they never had a bad session. And that sounds amazing – as a songwriter, that never happens!You can tell the whole record is festering with ideas. It’s insane, you can hear the fact that they’re writing continuously, it’s just pouring out of them, and that is so inspiring. On Helter Skelter, they accidentally invent heavy metal – it’s like, here’s heavy metal for you, bye! And every song seems to be written for a different set of instruments, like they’re so full of ideas and creativity that they just pick up anything, do something amazing with it, chuck it away and pick up the next thing. I love that. My parents introduced me to the Beatles, and I think it was appealing because, as a child, there are so many moments that are quite scary, actually. There’s Revolution 9 on there, which, if you’re a child, is really disturbing with those disembodied voices and strange sounds. It sounds like people are in trouble. Even something like Helter Skelter or While My Guitar Gently Weeps, there’s a strange sadness and darkness to it. In Rocky Raccoon, someone gets shot and in Bungalow Bill, he shoots an elephant right between the eyes. It’s scary. There are obviously moments of beauty, of silliness, of joy and so many emotions, but that feeling of “the world is a scary place full of unknown things” really comes to life on this record. As I get older, my ears change and I can appreciate why it was so affecting, and it makes me think about my own music and how I can steal their atmosphere. It’s very influential.Shortlisted Hyundai Mercury Prize album: Novelist GuyAlbum that inspired me: Boy in Da Corner (2003) by Dizzee RascalBoy in Da Corner inspired me to make my last album. I can’t remember the exact first time I heard it, but I remember how I felt. The beats didn’t sound like anything else. They put that album under the umbrella of grime but I still don’t think it sounds like the other beats that you’d affiliate with that music. It really stood out to me. I thought: I want to make something on that level.It was one of those albums that was everywhere. You’d hear the songs on the radio – I used to listen to pirate radio when I was young and sometimes I might hear Dizzee Rascal’s bars. It wasn’t so much the lyrics or the things he’d talk about – I didn’t really care about that when I was younger – but the beats.When I was making my last album, it was a big influence. It wasn’t necessarily that I wanted to replicate the sound, but I wanted to actually be that fresh. I wanted to make something new, completely new. That was my main thing. When I was producing my album, I was thinking: how can I make something that doesn’t sound like anything else? If I’m making an album, I don’t listen to any other music. I’ve taken in so much music in my life already that I just want to let whatever is seeping out of my pores come out.I’ve never met Dizzee Rascal in person but I have messaged him in the past to tell him: “I respect you man, and big up.” He was cool about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cf00e56fd504a3665add2da587d9b975c4119e6/0_0_3764_2259/master/3764.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b781d9b64c850f5e2b54bab91a1dbfe","title":"quiz how well do you know the hyundai mercury prize","story":" Only one artist has won the prize twice, while one has been shortlisted six times and never won.

Here are 10 of the most mind-meltingly, brain-bogglingly, heart-stoppingly creative records to have ever been nominatedPrimal Scream (1991) For the two albums that came before Screamadelica, Primal Scream were just another fey and jangly Scottish indie band. Enter DJ and producer Andrew Weatherall, who harnessed Bobby Gillespie and co’s interest in London’s buzzing late-80s acid house scene and helped turn it into a euphoric, hedonistic and era-defining record. Loaded is the hit, Slip Inside This House the inspired cover version and Don’t Fight It, Feel It the definitive instruction on how to do ecstasy-inspired raving properly.Spice Girls (1996)A short list of people who grew up listening to the Spice Girls: Little Mix, Charli XCX, Katy Perry, Adele. And Spice was the wildly enthusiastic in-yer-face dance-pop record that – thanks to enormohits Wannabe, Say You’ll Be There and Who Do You Think You Are – launched Ginger, Posh, Scary, Sporty, Baby and the “girl power” slogan into the mainstream quicker than you could say “zig-a-zig-ah”.Massive Attack (1998) Deep, dark, doomy and graceful, Mezzanine is trip-hop’s crowning glory. Teardrop is the most famous track, but Inertia Creeps, Risingson and Angel are just as harrowingly atmospheric. Made at a time when the mood within the Bristol band was terse, Massive Attack’s third album pongs of alienation, isolation and fear, and the trio became a duo shortly after the release when Andrew Vowles, aka Mushroom, jumped ship (or was pushed off).The Streets (2002) On which 23-year-old Birmingham boy Mike Skinner takes the sound of two-step UK garage and decorates it with often funny, frequently poignant and always relatable raps about, as he puts it on Has It Come to This?, a “day in the life of a geezer”. Booze, drugs, clubs, pubs, PlayStations, heartbreak, the quantity of fried tomato a fry-up requires – it’s all on there, still sounding fresh. Put on your classics and have a little dance. Dizzee Rascal (2003)Until the release of Skepta’s Konnichiwa in 2016, Dizzee Rascal’s Boy in Da Corner was the grime album. Released when the genre was still relatively young, it’s a frighteningly raw and angry take on the realities of growing up as a working-class kid in east London. Looking at the artist Dizzee has become, it’s hard to remember the shy teenager who raps so furiously about knife crime (Stop Dat), underage sex (I Luv U) and everyday violence (Seems 2 Be) over ice-cold beats that reflect the hopelessness of his situation. But he’s there, and he’s a genius.MIA (2005) There’s a lot to get your head round on the debut album from the London via Sri Lanka rapper. The title: MIA’s dad’s codename when he was in the Tamil Tiger militant group, given to the record in the hope he would one day Google himself and see what his daughter had made (he did). The sound: multicultural trans-global party music that nicks bits from all over the world, most notably hip-hop and dancehall. The lyrics: explorations of politics, culture, food, sex, war and revolution. Truly invigorating.The xx (2009)Listen to this debut album now, and you might think you’ve heard it all before. But none of London Grammar, Banks, Alt-J, Lorde or James Blake sounded like that before xx. Really, the only band that sounded remotely like the xx before the xx were late-70s Welsh post-punks Young Marble Giants. But the genius of the London band’s update on YMG’s minimal guitar sound is the use of cutting-edge production to create 11 spooky mini-epics that tell late-night tales of love, lust and longing.PJ Harvey (2011)From the moment she announced Let England Shake on the Andrew Marr Show in April 2010, telling the presenter: “My biggest fear would be to replicate something I’ve done before”, you knew Polly Jean Harvey’s eighth album would be special. Suspicions were confirmed when, 10 months later, an ambitious portrayal of the horrors of world war one and its aftermath appeared, featuring lyrics about soldiers falling “like lumps of meat” (The Words That Maketh Murder) and a country whose “fruit is deformed children” (The Glorious Land) in songs that took in folk, rock and pop, mostly made with guitars but with dashes of harp and sax in there too. PJ wasn’t done there though, and asked war photographer Seamus Murphy to make a video for every track to complete a fantastically creative vision.FKA Twigs (2014)Four years since Tahlia Barnett released her debut album, there’s still nothing quite like it. In a way it’s doomy alt-R\u0026ampB but just like, say, Bjork in her pomp, there are so many risks, ideas and moods on LP1 it would be unfair to label it. There are sad songs (Pendulum), sexy songs (Two Weeks), romantic songs (Hours) and vulnerable songs (Closer), a mega list of producers (Clams Casino, Sampha, Twigs herself and more) and a whole load of vocal experimentation. Yet it comes together because FKA Twigs, alien pop star extraordinaire, is right at the heart of all of it.J Hus (2017) The way J Hus’s debut brings together grime, garage, bashment, dancehall, afrobeat and early 00s hip-hop is as exciting as British music gets.

It has grown massively, with versions in New York and next year, for the first time, at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles.It is primarily commercial but has a blizzard of other events – including talks, performances, films, live works, free-to-view sculpture – which make it one of the most important events in Britain’s visual arts calendar.Tim Marlow, the artistic director of the Royal Academy of Arts and curator of this year’s talks at Frieze Masters, said Frieze “changed the landscape of London and the art world”, bringing an energy and sense of common purpose to this time of year.“It is very interesting that there are certain artists who in the past wouldn’t touch an art fair with a bargepole,” he said. “There is never a problem asking an artist to get involved with the talks programme, or any form of curated projects.”Marlow said it showed how boundaries were increasingly blurred between the institutional and the commercial. Examples of that might include the first year of an emerging artist prize, funded by a group of young collectors, in which the winner will be rewarded with an exhibition at Camden Arts Centre. Tate will once again get £150,000 to spend at the fair on works for its collection.Other events include the Frieze Debate at the Royal Institution where a panel of museum directors will debate museums in the 21st century.At the heart of Frieze will be the 160 commercial contemporary art galleries selling works by artists including David Shrigley and the 130 galleries at Frieze Masters selling works which might include bronze vessels from ancient China, medieval sculpture, or works of art by Degas, Kandinsky or Derek Jarman. The Dickinson gallery will recreate Barbara Hepworth’s sculpture garden from St Ives, complete with pond.• Frieze London and Frieze Masters take place in Regent’s Park, London 5-7 October with previews on 3-4 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b14a37f8b0b09b8186c3d23922d1405d875d27fa/350_88_550_330/master/550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fe9e53b844ec2ff56046ca2ee9335ea","title":"jack kerouac letter to mother recounts on the road adventures","story":"Written 10 years before the book that defined the Beat Generation, appeal for a $25 sub is now on sale in California for $22,500He may have been the godfather of the Beat Generation, a self-styled crazy hobo mystic who hit the US’s highways looking for himself, but Jack Kerouac wasn’t above asking his mother for money to tide him over on the epic journey he immortalised in On The Road.In a letter from 1947, written at the height of the travels that would form the basis of his classic roman a clef published 10 years later, Kerouac begs his mother, Gabrielle, for $25 to help him get from Denver to California.The handwritten note, dated 29 July, was written when Kerouac was 25, and is being sold through online bookseller Abebooks by Pasadena-based rare book dealers Whitmore for $22,500 (£17,000).The letter betrays a vulnerability in the young Kerouac perhaps overlooked by those who only know him as the free-wheelin’ author of counterculture classics. Opening the note, written in pencil, he begins “Dear Ma”, and gives Gabrielle instructions on how to wire the money to him from a Western Union branch near where she works in Brooklyn.However, despite saying he needs it because “hitchhiking is impossible across the desert and mountains”, Kerouac isn’t exactly living in squalor in Denver, writing: “I’m staying in a swanky apartment with showers and food and everything. But I want to get going so I can make a lot of money sailing in the Pacific and come home in the Fall and finish my book.”In a particularly tender line, Kerouac writes: “Gee, you can’t realise how much I miss you, and the house, and writing in my room. But I’ll be back in a few months and we’ll save some money.”Signing the letter “Jacky”, with three kisses, Kerouac also regales his mother with some of the adventures in Denver that were later detailed in On The Road: “Boy, it’s been a lot of fun around here … I had about 10 girlfriends went up to the mountains saw an opera ate swell food, venison steak.” Despite – or perhaps because of – all that, he says “I haven’t a cent left”.The Denver episode is an important one in the Kerouac legend, as it was the first real road trip he took and was rehearsed in On the Road. Denver was also the home town of Neal Cassady, the “side-burned hero of the snowy West” who was part best pal, part muse to Kerouac.In On the Road, in which Kerouac’s mother Gabrielle appears as the aunt of his alter-ego Sal Paradise, he directly references this letter: “I sent my aunt an airmail letter asking her for fifty dollars and said it would be the last money I’d ask after that she would be getting money from me, as soon as I got that ship.”When Kerouac did get to San Francisco to visit his friend Henri Cru, who appears in On the Road as “Remi Boncoeur”, his planned merchant seaman career never materialised. Kerouac ended up working as a security guard on a construction site.According to Whitmore Rare Books, the note “undermines the notion that the road trip was aimless. As he charts his path west, he plans out money and transportation, telling his mother about the need for efficiency if he’s going to meet his goals”.The text of the note was included in a volume collecting Kerouac’s letters in 1995, edited by his biographer Ann Charters, but has not been sold before.

In 2009’s “Not Fair” she grumbled about rubbish sex and being left lying in the wet patch, while in “As Long As I Got You”, an ode to new love, she sang: “Staying in with you is\u0026nbspbetter than sticking things up my nose.” So it’s not surprising to find that her first\u0026nbspmemoir has a tendency towards oversharing. In\u0026nbsprecalling her childhood, her rise to fame and her travails as a pop star, daughter, wife and mother, no detail is deemed too personal.In the introduction, Allen, 33, says she’s too young to write her entire life story instead she’s interested in “the things in my life that changed events, upended things, upset the cart”. Her father, the actor Keith Allen, is the first to turn things upside down, leaving his wife and children when his daughter was four. On the rare weekends that he saw his children, he would plonk them in a room at the Groucho Club while he got smashed in the bar downstairs. “I’ve learned over the years that everything is about him, so fine, that’s the deal,” Allen says. “I’ve stopped trying to fight or bustle about trying to find a spare slot in his universe.”Her mother, the film producer Alison Owen, began a relationship with Harry Enfield, which brought a period of stability. But Owen went on frequent work trips abroad, where she partied and took drugs. Soon she was doing the same at home. After five years Enfield ran out of patience, and Owen and her children moved out. The result was to create longstanding abandonment issues in Allen, along with what she calls a “raging co-dependency” – a desire to be loved and looked after, whatever the cost.If she is tough on the failings of those close to her, she is brutal when it comes to herself. She attends nine schools – some state, some private – eventually leaving at 15 with no qualifications. She drinks, takes drugs and has lots of sex, sometimes with men she likes but often with those she doesn’t. When she isn’t the life and soul of the party, she has tantrums and meltdowns and, at one stage, a breakdown. She endures untold trauma, from the stillbirth of her son\u0026nbspGeorge, to an attempted rape by a man she calls “Record Industry Executive”, to a stalker breaking into her home in the middle of the night. There are intermittent moments of joy, but more often there is sadness, shame, self-loathing and fury, all of which makes for compelling but discomfiting reading.The book serves as a cautionary tale for young women thrust into the limelight before they have fully understood who they are. You would struggle to find a more lucid and heartfelt account of how constant press attention – which, in Allen’s case, involved waking up to find 30 photographers watching the front door – can warp one’s sense of reality. She talks about the disconnect between her loudmouth public persona, whom she calls “Cartoon Lily”, and the quieter, insecure person at home, and how, when you read enough about your car crash life, it becomes self-fulfilling. She reveals the shock of old lovers selling their stories, the creeping paranoia that comes with anonymous sources leaking details of your private life, and the daily abuse from online trolls. It’s with palpable rage that she recalls her bulimia that was, she says, “a direct result of having my body constantly scrutinised. I’d sit in restaurants and as soon as I had finished eating, I’d be, like, ‘Fuck, how soon can I get to the loo?’”Elsewhere, Allen insists that her background as the\u0026nbspdaughter of well-known, comfortably off working-class parents makes her neither posh nor privileged. It’s the only moment in the book when her characteristic self-awareness deserts her. “Sure, I\u0026nbsphad media connections through my parents and an entrée into the Groucho fucking Club, but I\u0026nbspmanaged to get a career in spite of that and my education – not because of them,” she says, misunderstanding how privilege works.This isn’t to say that Allen hasn’t worked hard, or that her achievements haven’t sprung from a rare talent. In\u0026nbspher songs, she funnels dark themes into bracingly acerbic couplets and sets them against a jaunty soundtrack. In this visceral and affecting memoir, she seizes the opportunity to fill\u0026nbspin the gaps and create a\u0026nbspthree-dimensional self-portrait that is far removed from Cartoon Lily. “Telling stories is important, especially if you are a woman,” she says. “When women share their stories, loudly and clearly and honestly, things begin to change – for the better. This is my story.”• My Thoughts Exactly is published by Blink. To order a copy for £17.20 (RRP £20) go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846. Free UK p\u0026ampp over £10, online orders only.

The store is Tesco’s attempt to fend off the German discounters Aldi and Lidl.“There’s clearly not much to do on a rainy day in Chatteris that’s why so many people are here,” said Robert, a local resident who said he had come down “to see what all the fuss was about”.Lewis said the group planned to open 10-15 Jack’s stores over the next six months. The next shop will open in Immingham in Lincolnshire. Tesco has not yet confirmed other locations, but according to the Grocer magazine shop assistants are being hired for further outlets in Rubery, south-west Birmingham, St Helen’s, Castle Bromwich, Edge Hill in Liverpool and Middlewich, Cheshire. About half will be converted Tesco outlets, while others will be next to existing Tesco stores and some on new sites. Tesco has hired the former Aldi executive Lawrence Harvey to run Jack’s.The new chain is a bid to win back shoppers lost to the discounters, who now account for more than £13 out of every £100 spent in UK supermarkets – twice as much as five years ago.By 10:30am it was all but impossible to get into the store car park with shoppers leaving their cars on verges in their eagerness to sample the new shop.Customers were offered a glass of prosecco or orange juice and a cupcake as they entered plus a free Jack’s bag and other goodies. Vans with illuminated signs, parked at each end of the fenland town’s bypass signposted its arrival.Those who had braved the weather were certainly in the mood to shop. The Aldi-style fresh bakery was doing brisk business, with 50p baguettes flying off the shelves, along with croissants and brownies.Large numbers of staff wearing bright nametags were on hand to help shoppers find items.Mingling with the locals there were a lot of staff from rival supermarkets examining the prices. Prices of Jack’s products almost exactly mirrored those in the nearby Aldi store.Several shoppers said it reminded them of shopping 20 or 30 years ago. “I’m not sure how I feel about the packaging. It looks like it has come out of the 1950s. It looks a bit out of date to me,” said one woman in her 50s who declined to give her name.Like many of the other shoppers in Jack’s she said she normally shopped at Aldi, a two-minute drive from the new Jack’s store. “I came to give it a go to see what it was like. I don’t know if I’ll be back I may,” she said.In comparison to the hectic trading in Jack’s, the nearby Aldi was a picture of calm. Several customers shopping there had already been at Jack’s to collect the free bag but had not bought anything and then headed to Aldi instead.“We thought about going down there,” said one elderly couple looking for sultanas, “but Aldi’s are our store and I think will be sticking with it. It’s done us well over the years and I see no reason to abandon it now,” they said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a65bc9e8820710fc301989db3a35c975abc95eec/52_363_3165_1899/master/3165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb3f25700699fe9cdd8ba87014f1e8ac","title":"everday memories of addis ababa a photo essay","story":"Beginning as a Tumblr page, website VintageAddis invites Ethiopians to share old photographs from family archives, and aims to document the lives of communities throughout the 20th century. The web project and Instagram feed started by Philipp Schütz, Wongel Abebe and Nafkot Gebeyehu, reveals an intimate view of the city.Terefe Berlie Asmare moved to Addis Ababa in 1980 and spent much of the next decade driving. He worked at a garage in the Ethiopian capital by day, and studied engineering by night. At weekends he would roam the countryside in his father’s car, with a tent bought from the German embassy in the boot, and a Konica in his pocket.“I always took the camera with me,” he says, standing in the garden of Addis Ababa’s iconic, though fading, Wabi Shebele hotel, which is still owned by the family of Haile Selassie, Ethiopia’s last emperor. Asmare, now in his 60s, documented his road trips extensively, being one of the few people he knew with a camera – he was the lucky owner of the world’s first commercial autofocus. “There were no photographers at that time,” he recalls. “So I did most of the pictures myself, often with a self timer.”In one carefree shot he leans cockily against his Mazda car in view of Lake Langano, a spot popular with Addis Ababa’s middle classes then and now. His white socks are pulled up high and a red baseball hangs nonchalantly from his fingers. It’s a world away from the land of famine and war that foreign photojournalists etched in the popular consciousness of the 1980s.Terefe’s photos – he believes has more than 1,000 from this period – might have disappeared were it not for Vintage Addis Ababa. A website that started in July 2017 as a Tumblr page, the project Vintage Addis Ababa invites Ethiopians to share old photos from family archives as a part of an effort to document the lives of various people throughout the country’s tumultuous 20th century of empire, war and revolution.Vintage Addis Ababa is the brainchild of Philipp Schütz, a Swiss publisher and photographer based in the city, of Wongel Abebe, an Ethiopian photographer, and of Nafkot Gebeyehu, a documentary photographer. The project peels away the popular cliches to reveal a more innocent city with an intimate and familiar past.Schütz says, referring to some of the 1,800 plus photographs they have amassed so far: “They look exactly like my parents’ family archive, of the photos of my grandparents in the 1950s.” He and Abebe were surprised by the enthusiasm with which the city’s residents accepted the idea. “It was totally unexpected,” he says. “We’re not digging out 100-year-old photos. These are just everyday, family, stories from a time which a lot of people still remember.”Abebe thinks the project taps into a latent frustration with the way the Ethiopia has been represented over the years. “People are sick and tired of the famine and all that,” she says. “This is about how people want to be remembered.” Many of the photos they have received were submitted by friends and relatives wishing to commemorate their departed, or ageing, loved ones.Photographs belonging to the late Kassa Gebru, an engineer-turned-businessman who built Addis Ababa hotel in the 1950s, were given to Abebe by his daughter, who felt he deserved recognition for founding the city’s first venue for live jazz.The project also appeals to the occasional nostalgia some Ethiopians feel for their past, even for a period like the 1980s, a decade stained by bloodshed and economic privation under the communist regime known as the Derg.“I was a bachelor,” says Asmare. “I spent most of my time travelling and I really enjoyed it. In Addis there was less traffic because nobody had cars – the Derg had banned imports – and on Saturday nights there would be parties in Ras hotel, in Ghion hotel, and of course here in Wabi Shebele. When I look at the photos in my albums it’s like a dream.”“Genet’s father was very strict, like most fathers at the time. She wasn’t allowed to go out of the house besides go to school she was expected to come straight home afterwards and would be in trouble if she didn’t arrive within 30 minutes after home-time.” Girls at the time were expected to be timid and walk with their heads tucked down. They weren’t allowed to leave their house for just recreation. “One time, a few girlfriends and I took a photo as we celebrated a friend’s graduation at Addis Ababa university, as she earned her business degree. I had to hide that picture for years so my father wouldn’t see it.”Vintage Addis Ababa is part of a broader trend towards revisiting and rethinking Africa’s recent history. Schütz was inspired by a project that digitises old Ugandan photographs, though his focus was narrower and with more emphasis on family and private lives.Calling to mind the work of the late Malian photographer Malick Sidibé, and Burkina Faso’s Sory Sanlé, both of whom captured the colourful optimism of post-independence west Africa, these photos of mid-century Addis Ababa evoke a similar mood. They chart the evolution of fashion, hairstyles, and even the city’s physical environment, making Vintage Addis Ababa a rich exercise in cultural history. Some of the districts seen here have long since disappeared, or, like the old Italian quarter known as Piassa, are now on the brink of demolition.The project started out as a website aiming to reach as many Ethiopians as possible, but it is soon to be published as a book. The team also hope the idea will eventually spread to other Ethiopian cities.As it stands, Vintage Addis Ababa offers a glimpse into the past but only a fleeting one. “We don’t want to be misleading,” says Abebe, of the project’s title. “You can never represent the whole of Ethiopia in pictures.”“We learned everything, starting from shooting and marching, to office administration and finance,” she remembers. After an intensive training that took well over a year, the women were graduated by the emperor himself. The newly inaugurated women army never went to a battlefield. “We were always invited to shows and asked to make appearances at official events,” Tsehay chuckles, “We were treated more like celebrities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59ab1d0442a5293d5895a7564da8def3edbd8f0/0_216_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4256cdaaa63382d8961e6dd69a120c71","title":"dont walk this way why hong kong reopened a pedestrian street to cars","story":"When residents complained the noise from a pedestrianised street was causing sleeplessness and psychological distress, city authorities reopened it to cars. Was there a better way?Trying to walking through the pedestrian zone of Sai Yeung Choi Street South, walkers were always shoulder-to-shoulder, bumping into every other passing person. There was simply no way to avoid fellow pedestrians.Hong Kong’s Mong Kok area – “busy corner” in Cantonese – is a sea of people, shops and chaotic energy in the heart of the city’s most densely populated district.Within that, Sai Yeung Choi Street South was the street that never slept. After it was pedestrianised in 2000, the only islands in the sea of people were buskers, singers and dancers, all competing to drown each other out. Commonly known as “noisy street”, you could hear it long before you saw it.Complaints from residents led the government to restrict the pedestrianisation scheme to weekends and public holidays. Finally, this summer, it was scrapped entirely after more than 1,000 noise complaints motor vehicles were allowed back 24-7.With the buskers gone, vehicles are now the noisiest things on the street. The number of people seems the same, though – they’re just squashed onto the pavement to allow the cars through.“It had become a sort of poor man’s nightclub where competing performers, dancers and karaoke singers were blasting their music at 90-100 decibels,” says Carine Lai, senior researcher of Civic Exchange, an independent Hong Kong public policy thinktank. “To make things worse, there were residential buildings upstairs, so people were complaining of sleeplessness and psychological distress.”But Lai and others feel that closing the pedestrianised section of Mong Kok is not a long-term solution and does not address the root issue of street management problems in Hong Kong.“Whenever there were conflicts in the pedestrian zone in Mong Kok, the government always refused to consider alternatives or improvement measures, but simply avoided it by closing the street instead of finding better ways to manage it,” says Kathy Ip, the secretary general of Hong Kong Public Space Initiative.As cities around the world close central streets to cars to mark World Car-Free Day,  Cities is looking at the joys and trials of urban walking.The US humourist and writer David Sedaris tells us about walking in cities from Raleigh to Reykjavik. Will Self explains what he learns from perambulations in London, there’s Fran Lebowitz in New York, Helen Garner in Melbourne, “natural navigator” Tristan Gooley in Portsmouth, and writers on Delhi and Newcastle, Cairo and Wellington.Laura Laker casts a critical eye on the performance of Vision Zero, the global city scheme to eliminate traffic deaths. London has signed up – will it enjoy the success of New York, or the delays of LA? The recent blocking of Sadiq Khan’s plans to pedestrianise Oxford Street does not bode well.Correspondent Stephen Burgen samples the newfound silence in the Spanish car-free city of Pontevedra, and Matthew Keegan discovers what prompted Hong Kong to reopen a popular pedestrian street to vehicles.Renate van der Zee looks at the rise, fall and rebirth of the Lijnbaan in Rotterdam – Europe’s first pedestrianised street – while Rachel Aldred at the University of Westminster crunches the numbers to identify the most dangerous London boroughs for people on foot.Oliver Wainwright explores the City of London’s forgotten Pedways – and asks whether these 1960s walkways can make a comeback.We consider the phenomenon of “desire lines”, examine the art of following a stranger in the hope of seeing a city in a new light, and much more.Ip and other community groups believe the case of Mong Kok highlights the way Hong Kong is lagging behind major world cities in managing pedestrian areas: “We have suggested different modes of street management policy such as performance licensing and sound equipment control guidelines. The government needs to devise a holistic plan, instead of piecemeal approaches towards street management.”Paul Zimmerman, the CEO of Designing Hong Kong, a nonprofit devoted to improving urban planning in the city, describes the Mong Kok closure as “an absolute failure in walkability”. “The case has dramatically highlighted the failures in Hong Kong’s regime of street management,” he says. “These need to be resolved.”Hong Kong is renowned for its multi-layered pedestrian networks – at street level, below ground and above ground. These provide the necessary capacity in crowded high-density areas, and provide options that are especially relevant during typhoon season and throughout the city’s hot and humid summers. They also provide great connectivity to mass transit stations.“Pedestrians always come as a second thought during development,” adds Ip. “For a better living environment in Hong Kong, the needs of pedestrians should be the priority over the traffic.”Although it has been slow to come, there are some signs of change. Last year the government announced its commitment to strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a world-class walkable city.So far, projects have focused on ensuring the majority of future residences and workplaces are situated within walking distance of transportation nodes, services and other amenities, which will be connected by pedestrian-friendly or pedestrian-only walking environments such as precincts and station squares. Areas to benefit from this include the Kai Tak development area, Kwun Tong North and Hung Shui Kiu.The retrofitting of densely developed urban areas has also been a priority. A number of quick-win pedestrian improvement measures – such as footpath widening and pedestrian signals – have been installed in the Kowloon Bay and Kwun Tong business areas. The government also worked with Transport for London on a HK$3m (£293,000) project to display street signs showing maps and walking guides in the city’s bustling Tsim Sha Tsui shopping district.Pedestrianisation schemes in other parts of the city – busy neighbourhoods like Causeway Bay, Central, Jordan and Stanley – have been less controversial than Mong Kok. The temporary transformation of a 200-metre section of Des Voeux Road in Hong Kong’s Central Business District into a pedestrian precinct was also well received, with 50,000 people enjoying street soccer, a library, gym, picnic area and music.Planners like Ng believe the government should trial these types of schemes more frequently. “I don’t think the government or authorities should just close a pedestrian zone down,” says Ng. “I think our government needs to be more courageous and experimental in allowing the community to experiment with trial and error.”David Sim, a creative director of Gehl Architects, and his team have worked in China for 10 years designing pedestrian routes in cities like Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai. “I think it’s important to experiment with this kind of urban change,” he says. “The city and its citizens need to be taken on a journey, and that might be easier if you take smaller steps. It might start with an exceptional event to give people a one-off, new experience – like a street party or sports event – then continue as a more regular but still temporary change, and as the culture and behaviour evolves, the changes can develop further and perhaps become more permanent.”Sim is quick to add that projects can be quite modest too: “Even a low cost project can make a dramatic difference to urban life. It can actually be cheap to be nice to people.”We’re eager to hear your thoughts and experiences of walking in cities.

More revealing is what the gathering says about the balance of power: European leaders can send Theresa May away humiliated and empty-handed, and still imagine they have done her a favour.May was given 10 minutes to address her fellow heads of government over dinner last night, but no subsequent discussion was permitted because, formally, Brexit terms are negotiated with Michel Barnier and the European commission. Any British hopes that those lines might blur at Salzburg and more productive channels might then open up behind Barnier’s back were dashed. Concluding the summit, Donald Tusk, the European council president, re-affirmed member state solidarity behind the commission process. He also said bluntly that the economic aspect of May’s Chequers blueprint for Brexit “will not work.”None of this looks like the diplomacy that was promised by those hardline eurosceptics who insisted that the EU needed the UK more than the UK needed Europe. There would be cake to have and cake to eat the negotiations would simply be over the colour of the icing. Instead, the raw arithmetic of 27-to-one asserted itself. The prime minister’s advocacy of the Chequers plan has become a plea for mercy, although Tusk politely pretends the relationship is more balanced than that. European leaders can see how little room for manoeuvre May has in parliament and with her party.The timetable for Brexit talks has been stretched to swerve around the Conservative conference coming up in Birmingham, but not by much. Talk of an emergency summit in November, allowing some slippage from a scheduled deadline in October, sounded more provisional from the EU side than it does when UK officials have been organising their diaries.The British side had also hoped that some friendlier theatrics might have been staged at Salzburg to present May as the tough negotiator – some choreography of clash and concession to advertise the prime minister’s effectiveness. But there is a gap between what EU leaders think is a compromise with May (hinting that some kind of bespoke deal could yet evolve from Chequers) and what May can exchange for hard political currency back home. And on the substance – specifically the Irish border impasse – they cannot pretend there is progress if there is none.May’s weakness in Westminster still gives her one point of leverage in the negotiations – the alternative to dealing with her with little time to spare, is dealing with someone worse with no time at all. The prospect of, say, Boris Johnson emerging as his party’s champion from the rubble of a collapsed Brexit process is sufficient to focus minds in Brussels.Some EU officials and leaders see the risk that constructive British engagement with the European project could die along with May’s premiership. They see a messy Brexit provoking a lurch into something more like marauding, anti-Brussels, Trumpian nationalism. A faction of the Tory party is already saddling up for that journey.There is also the prospect of another referendum coming into focus over May’s shoulder although she pretends not to see it. In the past 24 hours, both the Maltese and Czech prime ministers have made encouraging noises about Britain reconsidering the whole Brexit enterprise – and being unanimously welcomed back into the fold. That might be overstating it. Across the EU there are many pools of sorrow at the UK’s 2016 decision to leave, but there are also now strong currents of impatience. Much goodwill was frittered away in the period when Tory ministers were making ludicrous Brexit pronouncements at home and offering nothing sensible abroad.There is also anxiety about the integrity of the European project that discourages anything that might look like a reward for splitting the union. This view – short-sighted, perhaps, but potent – holds that euroscepticism must be seen to end badly for the country that has taken it furthest. But the punitive urge is not paramount. In Berlin and Brussels, the capitals that still largely set the tone on Brexit, the emphasis is on getting the UK safely off the premises, not on finding ways to hurt us or keep us in.For now, May is the person with whom European leaders have to do business. But, more important, given the alternatives, she is also the person with whom they want to do business. The EU collectively has no interest in undermining or humiliating the prime minister. At the Salzburg summit it didn’t look much like May was getting any favours, but these things are relative. From the continental point of view, she was shown patience, she was indulged. Ultimately the EU cannot give May what she really needs, which is a Brexit model that will simultaneously satisfy the whole Tory party and win support from a majority in the Commons, without inflicting harm on the country. They cannot give her that because it doesn’t exist, never did, never will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78bcccb12b0f5158b00e04ee457595b37aa82527/0_372_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=776f902d5bcfa78c02a282b3dd9b64dc","title":"britain putin dark money impunity danske bank","story":"The Danske bank money-laundering scandal was only possible thanks to Britain’s opaque corporate lawsVladimir Putin’s global power is inseparable from his mastery of dark money, which he moves secretly to buy assets and influence. We know he’s doing it, because we can see the effects – the convulsions in Ukraine, the scandal in the United States – but it is far harder to know the precise mechanics.Thanks to a gigantic money-laundering news story, which this week brought down the head of Danske bank, we can get a sense of just how much money has been pouring out of the former Soviet Union, including cash belonging to the Kremlin elite. And it has all been happening because Britain has refused to help stop it.Danske bank has been rightly lambasted for its lax checks on the provenance of the money in so-called “non-resident” accounts, and may face costly legal action from the United States, but Britain needs to look at its role too. Without us, the ex-Soviet owners of this dark money would have found it far harder to hide.The owners of these suspicious accounts repeatedly obscured their identity behind Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs), a British corporate structure created two decades ago. A whistleblower who exposed what was happening in Estonia wrote to bank management in 2013 saying that criminals connected to Vladimir Putin were passing money through the bank, and that British limited partnerships were the “preferred vehicle for non-resident clients”.That explains why, by 2013, more than a quarter of Danske bank’s “non-resident clients” were nominally British, while another tenth were from the British Virgin Islands. These were not Britons banking in Estonia, but corporate vehicles, which moved billions out of Russia and Azerbaijan, helping the elites of two egregiously corrupt autocracies secure their wealth.Successive UK governments have boasted of leading international action to stop the rich and powerful abusing the globalised financial system to dodge taxes and hide stolen money. Companies House, which can be searched for free and where companies have to declare their true owners, is held up as a model for what the future should look like.But the more you look at Companies House, the more you hope the future looks very different. Russian crooks can still abuse limited partnerships in exactly the same way they did a decade ago. It is simple to create a limited partnership, owned by two companies in a tax haven, and then lie about who the true owner is. That obscures your identity completely, and costs you just £20: the public can’t tell if the information published by Companies House is correct, and Companies House itself doesn’t check.This is hardly a secret. Journalists have written about how LLPs and their close cousins, Scottish Limited Partnerships, have been abused for years, and you can easily find these questionable corporate structures for yourself: just open the Companies House website and type in some Nevisian company names – Tallberg, say, or Uniwell – and you can see dozens of them.Lying in corporate documents is illegal, but enforcement is nonexistent. Only one person has ever been prosecuted for it, and that was a British businessman who deliberately created companies in the names of politicians in an attempt to warn them of the risk of fraud. Instead of heeding the warnings of this corporate Cassandra, Companies House had him prosecuted and fined.Danske bank bought its Estonian unit in 2007, and originally intended to update its software to the standards of the parent company, which would have revealed the scams that were going on. When the financial crisis hit, however, those plans were shelved as too expensive, which meant managers in Copenhagen had no idea what their Estonian colleagues were getting up to.If the US Treasury Department hits Danske bank with the kind of fine it normally levies on foreign banks that facilitate the dodgy use of dollars – HSBC paid $1.9bn, Credit Suisse paid $2.6bn, BNP Paribas paid $8.9bn – that decision to save a bit of money on IT systems in 2008 may look like a disastrous case of false economy.Similarly, Britain’s decision to prioritise keeping Companies House cheap and easy, over keeping dodgy kleptocratic cash out of our economy, may come to look penny-wise but pound-idiotic. We know that Putin means ill for us, and our allies. We know that ex-Soviet oligarchs are seeking to buy influence here, in the same way they buy property – secretly and at vast expense. We now know they have been using our corporate vehicles to do that with, and it is urgent that we stop them doing so as soon as we can.• Oliver Bullough is the author of Moneyland: Why Thieves and Crooks Now Rule the World and How to Take it Back"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1774967ff6b9127a43b06c0685d1fd499c965141/118_0_3413_2048/master/3413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee9c583deb28b8dd73684050e78626d9","title":"build walls on seafloor to stop glaciers melting scientists say","story":"Barriers could halt slide of undersea glaciers and hold back sea level rises predicted to result from global warmingBuilding walls on the seafloor may become the next frontier of climate science, as engineers seek novel ways to hold back the sea level rises predicted to result from global warming.By erecting barriers of rock and sand, researchers believe they could halt the slide of undersea glaciers as they disintegrate into the deep. It would be a drastic endeavour but could buy some time if climate change takes hold, according to a new paper published on Thursday in the Cryosphere journal, from the European Geosciences Union.Though the notion may sound far-fetched, the design would be relatively straightforward. “We are imagining very simple structures, simply piles of gravel or sand on the ocean floor,” said Michael Wolovick, a researcher at the department of geosciences at Princeton University in the US who described the plans as “within the order of magnitude of plausible human achievements”.The structures would not just be aimed at holding back the melting glaciers, but at preventing warmer water from reaching the bases of the glaciers under the sea. New research is now being undertaken by scientists showing how the effects of the warmer water around the world, as the oceans warm, may be the leading cause of underwater melting of the glaciers.Wolovick and his fellow researchers ran computer models to check on the likely impacts of the structures they believe would be needed, taking as their starting point the Thwaites glacier in Antarctica, which at 80-100km is one of the widest glaciers in the world.They found that creating a structure of isolated columns or mounds on the sea floor, each about 300 metres high, would require between 0.1 and 1.5 cubic km of aggregate material. This would make such a project similar to the amount of material excavated to form Dubai’s Palm Islands, which took 0.3 cubic km of sand and rock, or the Suez canal, which required the excavation of roughly one cubic km.Glaciers melting under rising temperatures at the poles have the potential to discharge vast amounts of fresh water into the oceans, sending sea levels rising faster than they have for millennia. The Thwaites glacier alone, an ice stream the size of Britain and likely to be the biggest single source of future sea level rises, could trigger the melting of enough water to raise global sea levels by three metres.Many of these glaciers extend far under the sea, and scientists have begun to explore their subsea melting as well as the easier-to-measure reductions in the or visible parts. The undersea research vessel now known as Boaty McBoatface after its much larger relative was named the Sir David Attenborough is to be deployed at the Thwaites glacier for just this purpose.Building undersea walls could be accomplished by similar vessels but would have to be precisely positioned and strong enough to withstand the immense pressure of the ice.The authors hope that by creating their experimental models they can foster future research into the engineering needed to bring about such projects, which would take many years or decades to be worked out and implemented.Geo-engineering solutions such as this one should not deter the world from reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Wolovick said. “The more carbon we emit, the less likely it becomes that the ice sheets will survive in the long term at anything close to their present volume,” he said.The forthcoming report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is expected to warn afresh of the potential for sea level rises to inundate low-lying areas if warming is not held to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b8b7993f2eec4bdf726de929dc1c1d7b3fcb03a/0_0_4004_2669/master/4004.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2916ffdd4920384c966e87276e58ab2 700w","title":"20 best music documentaries ranked rock pop","story":"We rate the best films on the music scene down the decades, from Bob Dylan to Blur, Anvil to Amy WinehouseCharming Belgian TV presenter Marcel Vanthilt tries to get to grips with the New York rap scene.

Just an aesthetic amount, which is basically just enjoying yourself.” He hasn’t had the full, guided experience, he says, “where your mind is turned inside out. But I wouldn’t mind. I’m curious about it.”This curiosity is evident in the 41-year-old director’s new TV show, Maniac, which centres on pharmaceutical drug trials and takes viewers inside the minds of their human guinea pigs and off into fantastical realities. Fukunaga excels at such world building, from his gothic-tinged Jane Eyre to child soldier drama Beasts of No Nation, not to mention the debut season of the noir horror True Detective.No doubt these skills are what helped seal the deal when the producers of James Bond signed up the director after Danny Boyle dropped out at the last minute. The announcement came just days after our interview. So what clues can Maniac, as well as Fukunaga’s other work, give us as to what we can expect of 007’s 25th outing?Well, there will almost certainly be some intriguing gadgets. The retro future of Maniac boasts chess-playing android koalas, tiny sanitation robots and a depressed computer. Technically, the show is a remake of the 2014 Norwegian series of the same name, which Fukunaga hasn’t seen. “Not out of any disregard,” he says. He just liked the conceit of “a show with delusions”.The original Maniac concerned a mental institution. But in early talks with Emma Stone, who stars in the new version, launching this week on Netflix, the pair decided to stay away from anything that could be seen as making fun of mental illness, instead anchoring it on drug trials that aim to eradicate unnecessary human pain. Stone plays Annie opposite Jonah Hill’s Owen – damaged souls who, once strapped in, become other characters in other worlds, whether they like it or not. Amid all the surrealism, Maniac is littered with moments of real trauma. The first trial sees the guinea pigs taking a pill that makes them relive the most devastating moment of their lives. It’s not unlike people’s experiences with ayahuasca, which supposedly purges users of their demons (as well as the contents of their stomachs). Fukunaga says such substances didn’t influence the show at script stage but, before shooting began, he read an article about the therapeutic use of psilocybin and LSD studies. He was fascinated.“All of these things that open up gateways in the mind – there must be something there. The mind is so complicated, we don’t understand it at all yet,” he says, citing studies exploring how the trauma of previous generations can affect us. “Say your grandmother was in the Holocaust. That gets imprinted on the DNA. The maze to understanding how we carry all these things – I think it’s amazing.”Maniac allowed Fukunaga to work through his own issues, too. Almost all of the concepts on screen, as well as dialogue, come from conversations he had with co-writer Patrick Somerville. “It’s Patrick and I wrestling with our internal demons,” he says. “We’re almost working out our own understanding of ourselves.” So their conversations about therapy for a show about therapy were genuinely therapeutic? “In terms of me being fixed now, no. But it was definitely illuminating.”Fukunaga has always looked for answers in his work, and one can’t help wondering if the Bond template can accommodate such yearning. Will he be able to avoid friction with the famously controlling 007 producers, who have allowed directors little leeway in stamping their iniduality on the franchise, as Boyle appears to have found to his cost? We shall have to wait to find out. Like Boyle, Fukunaga has been known to walk from projects, but filming begins in March next year with a release planned for February 2020, assuming all goes smoothly.Fukunaga was raised in California, the son of a Japanese-American father born in a second world war Japanese internment camp and a Swedish-American mother. They orced when he was four, and his father went on to marry an Argentine woman, while his mother married a Mexican-American. From that point on, he straddled their worlds, moving about, spending periods in Mexico, absorbing cultures. As a teenager in Berkeley, he wished he was black instead of “the weird half-Asian kid, which didn’t seem like something to grab on to. I discovered Roots and Malcolm X. It was a golden age of hip-hop.”In Maniac, Annie and Owen become various characters in other times and places via pills that send them to alternate realities in their minds. Does that come from his own early searches for self? “It’s more about the different people we carry inside of us. I don’t think there was a black man inside of me,” he says with a laugh. “I was trying to find an identity, more than anything. Trying to figure out what my identity was.”Due to his eclectic roots and upbringing, he didn’t know where he belonged, and felt outside of himself. Writing stories helped, and his early films – immigration drama Sin Nombre then Jane Eyre – were “starting to scratch the surface of identity. And eventually you start looking deeper.”The first scripts of True Detective, about two cops on the trail of a serial killer in Louisiana, had already been written when Fukunaga was hired, but he brought his own aesthetic – most famously episode four’s six-minute tracking shot, which earned him an Emmy for outstanding directing. Not that he got caught up in the show’s success: by that point, he had isolated himself in a house with no internet access, writing Beasts of No Nation, which he’d been planning for 15 years, as well as his adaptation of Stephen King’s psychological clown-horror novel It.Fukunaga had been hired to work on the screenplay for It in 2012. As with the later Maniac, Fukunaga and co-writer Chase Palmer put a lot of their own childhoods into the screenplay, updating the novel’s setting from the 1950s to the 1980s. But in 2015 he jumped ship. “The writing was on the wall that it was going to be a difficult collaboration.” What did the writing say? “There were so many messages on that wall,” he says. “It was a neon sign by the end.” A non-disclosure prevents him from elaborating, but he did recently suggest that studio executives feared they couldn’t control him. Why did he think that? “You could just tell by the way they were acting.”It troubles him. “You’re still a human being, you still have feelings,” he says. “Especially if you’re a creative person. You’re sensitive. You get labelled in ways that aren’t you, and that’s frustrating.” More frustration followed, when he spent a year and a half adapting Caleb Carr’s Victorian-set serial-killer novel The Alienist for television, only to leave that after 18 months because of budgeting and scheduling problems. The final product, he says, was very different to what he had been developing.Clearly, Fukunaga doesn’t settle for anything less than exactly what he wants. It is sometimes difficult for him to articulate what he’s looking for, he says, but it’s there – a feeling or a vision. He talks about a scene in Beasts of No Nation in which he wanted the family to come out of a church on a grassy hill, with a specific idea in his head of what that church and hill looked like. He hunted for it. “I had a motorcycle and I would go out by myself on the weekends and just look around. You’re like a bloodhound, there’s a whiff: ‘Just over that ridge, hopefully there’s that thing I have in my mind.’ And the spooky thing is, sometimes you find it. We found that church. It existed.”All of this brings to mind Stanley Kubrick, also famously allergic to cutting corners. It’s no surprise then that Fukunaga is an enormous fan. After True Detective aired, he was hired to adapt and direct Kubrick’s unmade Napoleon film as a Steven Spielberg-produced mini-series for HBO, under the guidance of Kubrick’s long-time executive producer Jan Harlan. “We want to carry the torch in a way that embodies the spirit of what he was trying to achieve,” says Fukunaga, visibly excited. In a couple of weeks he will head to the library in Kubrick’s St Albans home to continue work with Harlan.“I’ve been there once before,” he says. “You can become jaded, working in this industry for so long, but there are moments like, ‘Holy fuck. I’m on holy, holy ground.’” Well, quite: Kubrick is buried there in the garden. He nods. “Jan brought me to his grave and introduced me to him,” he says, awed. “That was a momentous occasion.” No need for the psychotropics.• Maniac is on Netflix from 21 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b4a7d861f331ed5b3e653a3c407fc2417680e79/0_151_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=342b77fb7dea395f5e5effa6cdfb4e02","title":"cary fukunaga james bond director 007 true detective","story":"The director of TV’s True Detective and Netflix film Beasts of No Nation will bring thoroughly modern skills to Daniel Craig’s final Bond filmThe puffs of white smoke have emerged from the roof of the discreetly lavish offices of Eon Productions in London’s Mayfair – so weirdly similar to the old MI6 building in which Ian Fleming imagined 007 reporting for duty. This is the place where producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli make serious decisions about the colossally lucrative James Bond brand. The director of Bond 25 has been chosen. And any rumours we may have heard about Yann Demange being anointed turn out to be quite wrong. The person at the helm is to be Cary Fukunaga, 41-year-old director of Beasts of No Nation, Jane Eyre and Sin Nombre.What an interesting pick. Fukunaga is a very smart, capable director who has shown with his wide range of projects that he can handle action, ambitious location work and big above-the-title performances. Beasts of No Nation was the disturbing tale of African child soldiers which famously featured a showstopping turn from Idris Elba as the terrifying commandant – Elba himself being once mooted for 007. Jane Eyre was Fukunaga’s interesting and perhaps underrated adaptation of Charlotte Bronte’s classic novel, in which he shepherded excellent performances from Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender. Sin Nombre was a tough, socially aware thriller about Central American kids trying to get into the US. All of these pictures collectively showcase relevant CV ingredients: violence, suspense, sexual tension, black comedy.But Fukunaga has also shown himself to be a master of longform television, a string to his professional bow which previous directors haven’t had – not since the New Zealander Martin Campbell, who directed GoldenEye and Casino Royale. And Fukunaga is a thoroughly modern TV creative of the streaming era. He was a director of True Detective and, even more to the point, the forthcoming Netflix comedy drama Maniac, with Emma Stone – about a strange pharmaceutical giant claiming to have a wonder drug to cure all psychological ills. What a Bond villain that firm’s CEO would make. TV is where directors demonstrate their showrunning skills and ability to shape narrative arcs. That’s not a big necessity for Bond, of course. But TV reveals a sensitivity to script and performance, and there’s an army of Netflix customers who want classy, witty material as well as luxury cars, absurdly expensive watches and things getting blown up.So Fukunaga has an awful lot to offer. But what must also be a factor is what he is not offering. Unlike Danny Boyle, the brilliant director who finally couldn’t abide the corporate limits of Bond, Fukunaga does not come with people who want to start messing with the script and “bringing it up to date”, the bone of contention which apparently caused Boyle to press the button marked “ejector seat”. The screenplay is still going to be the province of Broccoli and Wilson’s tried-and-trusted writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. If they had been changed, that really would be news.James Bond is such a gigantic industry, comparable to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but with only one superhero. So Eon are very cautious about changes. Obviously, they are aware of the importance of being seen to refresh the product, and new directors are part of that, bringing their prestige as well as abilities. But rightly or wrongly, Eon doesn’t want auteurs. Sam Mendes, the director who took Bond to the next level of box-office success with Skyfall and Spectre, isn’t an auteur, but an outstanding team captain.

There is plenty of time to recover. For Manchester City, a 2-1 home defeat by Lyon is likely to be no more than a blip. Even in an underwhelming display, they had more than twice as many shots as their opponents and, more often than not, would probably have won. There is no reason to panic but that is not to say there are no reasons for concern.What will be most worrying are recurring problems. Pep Guardiola, we are told, has worked on new patterns of play for this season’s Champions League, different ways of breaking down obdurate teams. City had begun each of the five league games this season in a different shape. The aim appears to be even more flexibility, a greater range of options for matches against the elite. Perhaps it is natural that it will take time for those to be assimilated and given that Guardiola teams have had a tendency to peak early and blow themselves out by March, it is not necessarily the worst sign if they are not quite yet at their best.Two aspects in particular raise concerns. The first is the sense this City are susceptible to being pressed by quick opponents. Both Lyon goals on Wednesday stemmed from rapid turnovers after possession had been lost. It was not a repeat of the quarter-final against Liverpool last season in the sense that the assault was nowhere near so sustained, but it did show City, who at their best can seem almost irresistibly slick, can be unsettled by aggressive and coordinated opposition.That is true, though, of most sides nobody enjoys being pressed. And it is a high-risk strategy: press hard and if City can retain possession, they have the pace to exploit the space behind a high line – as Huddersfield have already found this season. Even if the new patterns Guardiola is working on do not produce that, the return of Kevin De Bruyne in a couple of months probably will.Of more concern, perhaps, is something less tangible, one of those traits beloved of the old-school football men: leadership. Guardiola is one of the more active managers on the touchline, forever standing at the edge of his technical area pointing and cajoling, constantly tweaking and adjusting. He remains the tactical brain of the side, even from off the pitch. He does not have at City a player to do for him what he did for Johan Cruyff at Barcelona, or what Xavi did for him.That is fine so long as he is there to convey his instructions, and so long as he can get the message across. Against Lyon, because of the suspension resulting from his dismissal in the quarter-final last season, he was confined to the stand, unable to guide his charges, unable to engage in the micromanagement in which he specialises.That is exacerbated by the way his philosophy demands players must sublimate themselves to the system. There is no room for iniduality. A player going off and doing his own thing breaks the structure and renders them vulnerable. That’s not to suggest that City need a solipsistic figure like Neymar to drift around and ignore defensive responsibility, but they can at times lack a little personality – particularly if Vincent Kompany is absent.Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s autobiography memorably described Guardiola’s Barcelona as a group of obedient schoolboys. They need their teacher for direction. That can produce interplay of incredible complexity, 11 iniduals functioning as one, but it also means that when things begin to go wrong, there is nobody there to grab a game and yank it back on course.This was not a meltdown such as Guardiola sides have suffered in the past, it was not a case of three goals being conceded in a 20-minute flurry but there was a strange lack of drive in the final minutes, an absence of the sort of ferocious surge that might have been expected after all, part of the point of City’s constant passing is to grind down opponents, to wear them out to soften them up for a late assault.But this is the paradox of post-Cruyffianism. There are – rare – occasions when it can feel a little mannered, where the very purity of the style seems to make it vulnerable, just as pedigree dogs are more susceptible to disease. That is why Cruyff brought in Hristo Stoichkov at Barcelona, to add the “mala leche” – literally “bad milk” but more idiomatically, toughness, ruthlessness, capacity for improvisation – he felt the side were lacking.To pick faults in a side who won the league with a record points tally last season can feel a little absurd but there are times when you wonder whether City may benefit from a few more rough edges, a greater capacity to think on their feet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1751a874a3a6ef576adb991c7a891c9f302c5d85/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6b5185be15546fe424455b3cda6a7a8","title":"mariano diaz real madrid new no7 cristiano ronaldo","story":"“It’s just a number,” Mariano Díaz said. But it isn’t. Over on the touchline, the fourth official held up the board. Coming off: No 11, coming on: No 7. Mariano stood and waited for Gareth Bale, wearing the shirt Cristiano Ronaldo wore for eight of the nine years he spent at Real Madrid until his departure this summer, that Raúl González Blanco wore for the 16 years before that and Emilio Butragueño wore for the 12 years before that. Thirty-six years, 14 league titles, seven European Cups and 911 goals later, it was his. No pressure, kid. As he waited, Julen Lopetegui approached. “I told him to stick it in the top corner,” the manager joked. “And he did what I said.”In the dying minutes against Roma on Wednesday night, Mariano smashed a shot that tore past Robin Olsen and into the net. He had been a Real Madrid player for 19 minutes. Well, 19 minutes and six years. At 25, this was “re-debut”. “I’m super-happy,” he said.Born in Premia de Mar on the coast in Catalonia, when he was growing up Mariano watched Ronaldo, the Brazilian, and Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto’o too. He first joined Madrid from third-tier Badalona in 2011, playing for Madrid C and then their second team, Castilla. His manager there was Zinedine Zidane – and it was Zidane who intervened when his contract was running down, with only six months left and little sign that he would continue. Six months later, he was in the first-team squad. In 2016-17, he played 14 games, scoring five times.Apart from the Copa del Rey, opportunities remained limited though and, having played only 115 minutes in the league, Mariano was sold to Lyon at the end of the season for €8m. He didn’t want to go – “if Zidane had said he was counting on me, I would have listened for sure,” he said – but Madrid convinced him.“The kit man asked which shirt I wanted and I said 7,” he said. “It’s the one that was free, I imagine no one wanted it.”Mariano has a Dominican father and scored for the national team against Haiti in March 2013 but he had decided not to continue in the hope of playing for Spain. “I’d love to play for Spain I’m going to work so that one day Lopetegui calls me,” he told El País in November last year. Back then, Lopetegui was Spain’s manager by the time the call came this summer, he was the coach of Madrid. “I was super-nervous when he rang,” Mariano admitted, but the conversation convinced Lopetegui told Mariano that despite the players ahead of him, he would get opportunities.The first didn’t come until Wednesday night, and there was a touch of impatience from some. Madrid’s play had improved but some felt they lacked a predator to make it pay. A youth teamer returning home, when Mariano went to warm up there was a huge cheer and another accompanied him onto the pitch. He ran straight at Roma, showing no sign of pressure. There was a directness, a bluntness even, about his response to the shirt that fits the way he plays – even if, pushed, he insisted: “I have a lot, a lot, of respect for Ronaldo and everything he has done, and for all those who have worn this shirt.”Ronaldo, Raúl and Butragueno have been the previous occupants but if there is a Madrid player than comes to mind watching him, it may be Hugo Sánchez, the man who one season scored 38 league goals, all with a single touch: strong, quick, direct, aggressive, a finisher. No messing, just goals.Mariano had taken eight shots as a Madrid player and scored five of them, according to Opta that’s six from nine now. There’s something about him that recalls Bill Shankly’s famous remark to Ian St John: “If you’re not sure what to do with the ball, just pop it in the net and we’ll discuss your options afterwards.” Only Mariano isn’t likely to “pop” the ball anywhere he’s more likely to bludgeon it.On Wednesday night, he certainly did, sending it flying into the net. “I’m going to keep this shirt for ever,” he said, afterwards. On the back was a seven."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5db320e10cb17ccdcf65dff1d049405aa31ecf/403_57_1046_628/master/1046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d74ce2036964ca4473bda46d0d32d5","title":"liverpool impress ronaldo ridiculousness and cows cows cows football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Jonathan Wilson to discuss the Champions League, Ronaldo’s red, the timekeeping skills of cows and Mark Hughes’s elusive smileJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

She had been hoping to take warm words over Chequers into Conservative party conference.Tusk, who moments before his comments had a short meeting with the prime minister, told reporters that he also wanted to wrap up successful talks in a special summit in mid-November.But, in a step designed to pile pressure on the prime minister, he said this would not happen unless the British government came through on its commitment to finding a “precise and clear” so-called backstop solution that would under any future circumstances avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.“Without an October grand finale, in a positive sense of this word, there is no reason to organise a special meeting in November,” Tusk said. “This is the only condition when it comes to this possible November summit.”The deadline of the weekend of 17 and 18 November on the Irish issue is a looming threat to May, who had told the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, earlier in the day that she did not think it was possible by the October summit for her government and the EU to come to a compromise on the issue.The EU has proposed that Northern Ireland in effect stays in the single market and customs union as the rest of the UK withdraws. The prime minister insists she will not sign up to such a plan, which she claims would economically and constitutionally “dislocate” the UK.Tusk also offered a withering assessment of the economic proposals in the Chequers plan, under which the UK would have a common rulebook with the EU for goods, and benefit from frictionless trade and an independent commercial policy through a bespoke customs arrangement.“It must be clear that there are some issues where we are not ready to compromise and first of all this is our fundamental freedoms and single market and this is why we remain sceptical and critical when it comes to this part of the Chequers proposals,” he said.Macron dismissed May’s suggestion that Chequers was the only solution other than a no-deal scenario.He said of the white paper: “It was a good and brave step by the prime minister. But we all agreed on this today, the proposals in their current state are not acceptable, especially on the economic side of it. The Chequers plan cannot be take it or leave it,” he said.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, agreed during her press conference that “substantial progress” was needed on the UK’s withdrawal agreement by the next European council meeting in October in order to pave the way for it to be finalised at a special summit in November.Merkel said there was “still a large piece of work” on the separate issue of future trade relations with the UK. The EU27 was “united that, in the matter of the single market, there can be no compromises”, she said.“No one can belong to the single market if they are not part of the single market.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d202b7e48e3e4730a4b7093aa70f90a0137909e4/0_296_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21907202e798a083c0b7c4183ee45c88","title":"huge rise in ambulance callouts to deal with spice users","story":"Figures prompt concerns from paramedics and police that some areas may be engulfed by synthetic cannabinoidsThere has been a dramatic increase in ambulances being called to deal with people who have taken the dangerous synthetic cannabinoid spice, with paramedics in some areas of England dealing with six times as many affected people compared with last year.The figures have prompted concern from paramedics and police that some areas may be engulfed by the substance, which has become a persistent problem among homeless communities.The warnings come despite it being reclassified as a class B drug more than a year ago. Anyone found to be in possession of it could face up to five years’ imprisonment.Data from West Midlands ambulance service showed a surge in call-outs linked to spice and black mamba (another name for the drug). Numbers went up from 2,890 call-outs between January and July 2017, to 3,233 in the same period a year later.Figures from South Western ambulance service NHS foundation trust (SWASFT) painted a similar picture. Between August 2016 and July 2017, 157 calls were about the synthetic cannabinoid, compared with 960 from August 2017 and July 2018.SWASFT said it had seen a “significant rise” in the number of patients experiencing symptoms from taking spice, but incidents remained a small proportion of the 900,000 annual calls they get.“The effect on the patient can vary considerably our staff often treat legal high users who have suffered seizures, heart attacks and strokes. Some patients are left with long-term illnesses whilst others never wake up,” he said.Police and charities have also warned that use of the psychoactive substance is a big problem.“The reason spice use has gone up is that we have lots of people who are very hurt and not enough resources and time out there to understand what we are working with.”Spice is a manmade chemical with mind-altering effects. It was initially marketed as having effects similar to those of cannabis but is believed to be stronger. Usually the chemicals are sprayed on to plant materials to make it look like marijuana. Those who take spice can experience a faster heart rate and a feeling of confusion. It has been linked to a rising number of emergency department visits and to some deaths.Nick Buckley, the chief executive of the antisocial behaviour reduction charity Mancunian Way, said: “Spice is still a huge problem but it’s not hitting the headlines any more. Its use is epidemic among the rough sleeping community in Manchester city centre. It is the drug of choice.”Buckley said the influence of spice on the vulnerable could be immense. “One gentleman I saw was in his 30s and was almost foaming at the mouth. He was lying on the floor and some teenagers were taking pictures and laughing and trying to provoke him. Members of the public were calling the emergency services and trying to get him to sit up.”Harry Sumnall, a professor in substance use at the Public Health Institute at Liverpool John Moores University, said evidence suggested the harms of spice had not decreased but there was no good data on it. “It’s so regionally specific and tends to be a greater focus of attention where street homelessness is more visible,” he said.Data exclusively obtained by the  through freedom of information requests revealed that the number of police crime reports in which spice is mentioned has risen fivefold from 234 in 2015 to 1,157 last year. Of the 2017 reports, 725 were for drug offences and 432 showed spice was mentioned in relation to other crimes such as violence with injury.In Derbyshire, the number of crime reports mentioning spice went from eight to 101 in three years.The force has launched a large-scale operation to tackle the issue. Warrants have been issued and 11 people arrested on suspicion of supplying class B drugs.Data from the British Transport Police showed references to spice went from zero in 2015 to 80 last year. ”A large part of the rise can be linked with the introduction of the Psychoactive Substances Act and the fact that cannabinoids were added to the Misuse of Drugs Act in December 2016.Last year spice was reclassified as a class B drug following advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.Simon Bray, the National Police Chief Council’s policing lead for new psychoactive substances, points out that its use is also growing in prisons. “In some prisons the use is quite heavy and that is because not all prisons have the same controls over how it gets in,” he said.“To deal with it we need all agencies to tackle it. It’s harmful stuff and it does impact on the brain and has a tendency to make people violent in some cases,” he added.Ball said: “I remember speaking to one young man about what he wanted from spice and he said: ‘It makes me feel like my head has been cut off.’ He was seeking a sense of dismemberment.“We have got to a place in society where money is being withdrawn from basic life-giving services. We are a very stressed sector trying to deal with very traumatised people. It’s the perfect storm.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dda3955a1c808b01a32300f262d19a22b67e297/818_392_3550_2130/master/3550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b215fe0a976a2c15b84150aaf1a94b96","title":"im hard left hard remain grassroots bid for labour brexit seachange","story":"Constituency groups could force Jeremy Corbyn to agree to a ‘people’s vote’ at the conferenceFew people in Labour have heard of Michael Chessum, the self-described “hard-left, hard-remain” campaigner, who concedes he is an unusual frontman for a campaign that could transform the Labour party’s Brexit policy.“Last year the faces were Chuka Umunna, Heidi Alexander, I can’t really believe that this year, it’s people like me, it’s weird,” he says in his shared south London office, surrounded by anti-Brexit paraphernalia and protest signs.Chessum’s group, Another Europe is Possible, is just one of a number of grassroots organisations that have forced the party to have a conversation about Brexit that it has long delayed.More than 150 constituency Labour parties have submitted Brexit motions for debate at the party’s conference, which begins in Liverpool on Sunday, with the vast majority calling for a vote on the final deal.It is the result of an intense and unprecedented ground campaign by a coalition of grassroots groups. One Labour official said the number of motions on Brexit was so vast that they could have difficulty devising other motions for debate on other topics.Last year in Brighton, delegates followed Momentum’s direction to save the leadership’s blushes and blocked any potential vote on Brexit. In Liverpool, delegates will arrive with an unprecedented mandate from members to put a second referendum on the table after a campaign led by the pro-Corbyn grassroots.“The numbers are completely crazy. I thought we’d get 50,” one pro-remain MP said.Many campaigners and MPs hope the efforts will resonate beyond the party conference in ways that could have a major and unforeseen effect on the parliamentary arithmetic.“It gives MPs some cover,” another MP said. “Some have resisted voting on anti-Brexit amendments because they will get grief locally for seeming to be disloyal. But if their CLP has put this motion forward, it gives them the freedom to vote with their conscience.”Chessum, a member of Momentum’s first steering committee, said he wanted to transform the pro-remain cause within the party into one that was explicitly leftwing, tribally Labour and pro-Corbyn.“I am a diehard remainer and a diehard member of the hard left,” he said. “There is no bespoke Labour Brexit on the table. There is no time, even with a general election.”Chessum argues he is giving the leadership space to change its position, rather than closing it into a corner. “The Labour right loves ‘Corbyn v the membership’. That’s not what this is.”The group is technically cross-party and has worked with other leftwingers and Greens. For the summer, it has been working in co-ordination and hosting phone banks for another explicitly Labour group run by Mike Buckley, a former aid worker and community organiser, who founded Labour for a People’s Vote this year.“There was nothing to rally behind,” he said. “The people talking publicly about having another referendum, however well intentioned they are, they are not going to gather the majority of Labour party members behind them because they are seen as being anti-Jeremy.”Both groups have regional organisers and have relied on sign-ups and their existing networks, in local parties and Momentum groups, some relics of the 2016 referendum campaign. Among the organisers is Alana Ivanova, a Momentum campaigner who started a petition to get the grassroots group to adopt a second referendum.Ivanova said campaigners hoped to tap into new Labour members’ passion for party democracy. “Brexit is a major test for that,” she said.Ana Oppenheim, another organiser, said many members did not know how to use the party’s existing democratic levers. “Now the left’s in control, it’s a chance to use them for something we believe in,” she said.For all the groups involved, there is no roadmap. The summer’s efforts have involved a painstaking task of identifying pro-European members in more than 600 local parties, through a mix of local contacts, friends of friends, and online signups, and getting them to champion a motion through their CLP.Buckley said that organising local parties has been “surprisingly difficult” and relied on local knowledge. Both groups have links with the main cross-party campaign People’s Vote, but maintain a public separation. Another mainstream group, Best for Britain, the anti-Brexit campaign that has the financial backing of billionaire philanthropist George Soros, has given £70,000 to Another Europe is Possible.Pro-European MPs have aided the groups in the background, helping them make connections, but have deliberately not led the campaigning.Though the groups are mainly run by young activists, it is older Labour members who have been the focus of some of the summer campaigning, because they make up the bulk of new members active in CLPs.The group that has most successfully used this tactic is the energetic pro-remain youth group For Future’s Sake (FFS) – a cross-party campaign which has close links to the official People’s Vote movement.Its young organisers have made provocative videos, deliberately designed to appeal to older members, placing the arguments about Brexit in the context of progressive political movements in British history, including the campaign for women’s suffrage and fighting the poll tax.FFS’s Liron Velleman has been co-ordinating its campaign on the ground to get CLPs to submit motions. “We get young people to sign up and then encourage older people from the CLP to get involved in the fight,” he said. “We tell them, our generation needs yours.”Previously unreleased data showed the average age of Labour party members and supporters who joined after 2015 is 51, and the most common age of this cohort to be 66. The project’s summer 2017 survey of Labour members revealed an average age of 53, with the most common age being 70.Now the local party organisation is over, campaigners from the main groups are turning their attention to the party conference itself. The first hurdle is ensuring Brexit is a topic on the agenda at conference, as one of eight topics chosen by members.Last year, Momentum steered its delegates to vote for other topics, including housing, NHS and the railways. That will not be repeated, its national co-ordinator, Laura Parker, said. “Last year, the context was very different. Now, it’s absolutely inevitable there will be a discussion on conference floor, I can’t conceive there won’t be – we’re 200 days away,” she said. “Without a doubt, there has to be a debate.”Momentum has not backed a new referendum and there is clearly some caution about doing so. Parker’s instincts are pro-Europe, but she is wary of restricting the Labour leadership’s political flexibility.“We are waiting to see what motions come to conference floor,” she said.Once Brexit is confirmed as a topic for debate in the ballot, delegates from those CLPs will meet trade union representatives and Labour’s Brexit secretary Keir Starmer on Sunday night to thrash out a compromise motion that could go to a vote.Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, an FFS co-founder, said the groups would be co-ordinating. “The one cast-iron agreement across all the groups is that a people’s vote is the way to solve the crisis,” she said.Some senior Labour sources cautioned that it was now uncertain if delegates would be responsive to either Momentum or any of the other campaign groups.“Delegates are totally unbiddable now,” one said. “Last year, there was some degree of predictability that most delegates would at least do what Momentum instructed, but that is no longer the case.”Key to the success of any motion or compromise is the support of trade unions. Campaigners have been closely watching both the Unite conference and the subsequent Trades Unions Congress, where union leaders accepted or put forward motions that could be a blueprint for the Labour outcome.One of the “big three” unions, GMB, has already officially backed a new referendum, after polling its members. Smaller unions have also been key players, most notably TSSA and its general secretary, Manuel Cortes, and Community, a centrist union with many Brexit-voting members whose industrial membership recently backed a vote on the deal.Unite, Labour’s most generous donor and the UK’s second largest union, left the door open to backing a second referendum at its conference, with a leadership statement saying it was “open to the possibility of a popular vote being held on any deal, depending on political circumstances”.That statement is now the most likely model for a Labour compromise. “The key voice in the room will be Unite,” one senior union source said.The third major union, Unison, the largest in the UK, has remained studiously neutral. “They will be in the room at conference, they might act as honest brokers, but they don’t want to be forced to take a position,” the source said.The final outcome may ultimately be a fudge, the party’s governing national executive committee could offer a policy statement, keeping a referendum on the table without endorsing it. Starmer and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have trialled that line in recent months.However, even if the NEC offers a statement, delegates could still push for an additional vote and a more radical motion.In the end, there is little will at the top of the party to prevent a Brexit debate taking place. “We would look ridiculous,” one source close to the shadow cabinet said. “The headlines last year were bad, but this would look terrible to outsiders watching.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d08374778fef4602cfb829e1df3b5e6ff2af62/0_150_2833_1700/master/2833.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f450b67b7961cf6200150b40845e350","title":"macron urges eu leaders to stand firm against theresa may brexit","story":"French president says EU should resist prime minister’s calls for compromise on BrexitEmmanuel Macron has appealed to his fellow European leaders to maintain their tough approach to Brexit in response to Theresa May’s demand for compromise and accusations that the French president wants to make Britain suffer.Macron, who is fighting a rearguard action against the rise of populism in Europe, said blocking any attempt by the UK to pick and choose elements of EU membership had to be the priority in the dying days of the Brexit negotiations.“May spoke last night,” Macron said of the UK prime minister’s presentation to the leaders in Salzburg. “My first wish is to stay united and to have a common approach, the 27. It is essential. The second thing is that we remain coherent. The solution must be found. The third thing is that we need to have a real retirement agreement by November.”A number of fellow EU leaders have conceded that compromise from both sides is needed to reach a deal both on avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and on the future framework of a trade deal.The nationalist prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orbán, who has sparred with Macron over migration, told reporters he was getting close to building a majority of member states in opposition to “a camp of prime ministers” who believe the “British must suffer”. “I don’t like that approach at all,” he said.Over coffee at the end of a dinner that finished after midnight, May insisted the UK had moved its position and it was the turn of Brussels to reciprocate.Trying to strike a tough tone the prime minister told her counterparts “that the UK will leave on 29 March next year” and as a result “the onus is now on all of us to get this deal done” by the end of an emergency summit that the EU confirmed would happen in mid-November.May met the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, over breakfast in the morning, as the two leaders held further talks over how to resolve the Irish border question and what customs arrangements would be necessary after Brexit.Both sides reiterated the need to agree on some form of backstop if it did not prove possible to reach agreement on a future trading relationship, although there remain considerable differences between UK and EU approaches. The meeting between the two leaders is understood to have been amicable.However, there is a consensus among the 27 member states that the central planks of May’s Chequers plan on trade are not workable, but with the encouragement of Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, some have suggested the EU should seek to bridge the gap with fresh proposals.Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian prime minister, said: “You know that, as before, the approaches are very different. But to report something positive, inside the room, away from the hard media statements outside, I think both sides are aware that they will only reach a solution if they move towards each other.”Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, told reporters as he arrived at a summit that he believed “compromise from both sides, not from one side” was necessary. But when asked why the EU had not budged, he added: “We have some colleagues around the table who think the same about Theresa May.”The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, whose country is an advocate for offering May a counter-proposal in the coming weeks, said that avoiding cherry-picking by the British while keeping them close and avoiding a no-deal scenario was a difficult balancing act.The EU is aware of the domestic dangers facing May as she approaches the Conservative party conference and beyond. The usually outspoken European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said of May’s brief speech: “It was interesting, it was polite, it was not aggressive. She is doing her job.”Earlier, the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said he would like to see Britain hold a second referendum on membership of the EU – even though May pointedly told EU leaders that one was not on the table.May specifically ruled out a second vote in her comments at dinner. But Babis told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We hope that finally we will reach a deal but I am very unhappy that the UK is leaving, so it would be better maybe to make another referendum and maybe the people in the meantime could change their view.“Europe has a lot of problems. We have problems with Mr Trump about tariffs, sanctions with Russia, Brexit, migration and so on. For Europe, it’s quite a difficult time. We were shocked when the referendum was announced that there were so many people practically unhappy. Even the chief of commission didn’t understand.”Babiš said a second referendum would “solve the problem quite quickly”, but he also said there would “hopefully” be a deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e06f6ffaf05e58422e035153db133ac4cc173daf/0_0_3989_2394/master/3989.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b21c952402aef9cee4c1608437ed0886","title":"not enough time to hold referendum on final deal before brexit","story":"As pressure builds for ‘People’s Vote’, constitutional experts say it would take at least six months to organiseA referendum on the Brexit deal would take at least six months to organise legally, making it very difficult to have a second vote before the UK is scheduled to exit the EU on 29 March next year, constitutional experts have said.As EU leaders including the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, called on Theresa May to change firm government policy and put a vote to the people, academics said there was not enough time if article 50 is enacted as scheduled.There are indications that a delay to the enactment of article 50 could be acceptable to the EU, but without this agreement time stands in the way of a second referendum, experts believe.“It is just possible to hold one within six months, but the shorter the timescale, the higher the chance of the question or other aspects of the referendum being challenged over their legitimacy,” said Prof Robert Hazell of the constitution unit at the department of political science, University College London.Fresh legislation, testing of the question by the Electoral Commission and a 10-week regulated period for a campaign are all required before a referendum can take place, he pointed out.David Cameron’s Brexit referendum took just over a year to get to the ballot box.The UCL researcher Jess Sargeant, who is about to publish a report on a second referendum with Alan Renwick, the deputy director of the constitution unit, said that even if all elements of the process went smoothly and speedily, “the total period from start to finish would be 24 weeks”.The first hurdle is the requirement for primary legislation, which would be highly contentious and require due process in parliament.“With political will, legislation can be rushed through on significantly reduced timescales,” says Sargeant in a blogpost on referendum timetables.But, she warned: “The government’s narrow majority, dependent on DUP support and subject to internal party isions, makes the situation highly unpredictable.”Hazell pointed out that if such a law was passed, then the Electoral Commission would have to advise on the “intelligibility” of the referendum question, a process that usually takes 12 weeks.The commission would than designate lead campaigners to both sides, which adds more time.And finally, under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act (PPERA), a 10-week campaign period is specified.Five referendums have been held under PPERA, three of which were enabled through primary legislation, including the North East England assembly ballot, the alternative vote referendum in 2011 and the 2016 Brexit vote.The AV referendum, which took the shortest time, took nine months. The Brexit referendum took just over a year from start to finish.May said her government would never accept a second referendum on Brexit. But a report, published on Tuesday (pdf), and backed by the author of article 50, Lord Kerr, argues it is not too late to have one. The report by campaigners for a second referendum, the People’s Vote, said one way to condense the timetable would be to “cut and paste” the legislation that was used for the 2016 referendum.It also said that given the urgency of the matter, politicians could fast-track legislation through parliament to enable a swift vote.UCL points out that with political will, the legislative process can be shortened. In 2005 the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) 2005 received royal assent within three weeks of its introduction.The People’s Vote said politicians would e judged harshly if they denied calls for a second referendum on the grounds that it would be too difficult to arrange in the short time remaining.“History will not, in our opinion, be kind to any politician who hides behind purely logistical arguments, legalese or arcane parliamentary procedure in order to deny people a vote on the outcome of these Brexit negotiations at such a fragile and crucial moment for our country,” said Kerr.

Cipriani has since made a flying start to the season with Gloucester but he is the eye-catching omission from Eddie Jones’s 36-man squad, which includes Manu Tuilagi and the suspended Chris Ashton.Cipriani is England’s incumbent fly-half, having made a first start in a decade against South Africa in June, but in August he was arrested following a nightclub incident during Gloucester’s pre-season tour of Jersey. He was fined a total of £4,000 and found guilty by the Rugby Football Union of “conduct prejudicial to the interest of the game”.This month Jones revealed he had since visited Cipriani and that he would “make a decision on whether he’s going to add value to the team”. He also added that: “If a guy gets in trouble all the time you’ve got to have second thoughts about it.”Jones does not name his squad for England’s autumn internationals until 18 October – this is a three-day training camp in Bristol where the players will, among other things, get accustomed to their new defence coach, John Mitchell – but while Cipriani’s hopes of retaining his place are not over, his omission would suggest his chances are damaged.Tuilagi meanwhile, is rewarded for showing some semblance of early-season form – he has started all three of Leicester’s matches and scored a fine try against Newcastle – and is included by Jones for the first time since he was sent home in disgrace after a late-night drinking session last August. He has not played for England since a replacement appearance against Wales during the 2016 Six Nations and not started since the summer of 2014 but Jones’s decision to cast his eye over him makes obvious sense with exactly 12 months to go until the World Cup.“It’s the first time in the three years I’ve been in England that Manu’s been fit,” said Jones. “He’s put together a series of games and we’re looking forward to him continuing on that run. He’s got the opportunity to come in and show us what he’s got.”Ashton’s selection is not surprising in that Jones had hinted at including him a couple of weeks ago but he is currently in the middle of a seven-week suspension for a tip tackle during pre-season and will not have played a competitive match this season before Jones names his autumn squad. Ashton was included in Jones’s August training squad however, in what constituted an immediate recall following his summer move from Toulon to Sale.Among the other notable inclusions is Michael Rhodes, Saracens’ uncapped South Africa-born flanker who may make his debut against the Springboks in England’s opening autumn fixture on 3 November. Billy Vunipola is in the squad, as are Zach Mercer and Joe Cokanasiga but their Bath teammate Sam Underhill is a surprise omission. As are the Exeter pair of Luke Cowan-Dickie and Sam Simmonds – though the former suffered a rib injury at the weekend and the latter missed out through illness.The Wasps pair of Joe Launchbury and Brad Shields are both included despite carrying injuries while Danny Care, George Kruis and Jack Nowell all return the squad. Dan Cole is still not in the squad though, nor is James Haskell following his summer move to Northampton.Jones added: “It’s a chance to get the players thinking about England and the way we want to play for England and the way we want to beat South Africa. These players have the opportunity to press their chances for selection ahead of the first Test so they will have to be enthusiastic and ready to give their best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48df59ccc97759e76d793941b3090dc30a7e68bf/32_0_5248_3149/master/5248.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee6dd1a71ce1d6138f3ff8a395464e3","title":"johanna konta out pan pacific open donna vekic","story":"• British No 1 beaten 6-3, 7-5 by Croatian in second round• Konta lets 4-1 lead slip in second set in TokyoJohanna Konta let a significant lead slip away in the second set as she slumped to a straight-sets defeat by Donna Vekic in the second round of the Pan Pacific Open.The British No 1 was knocked out of the US Open in the first round by Caroline Garcia last month and her fragile confidence was again evident in Tokyo. She had dropped only two games in thrashing the qualifier Gabriela Dabrowski in the first round but, having led Vekic 4-1 in the second set with a double break, Konta lost six of the last seven games to go down 6-3, 7-5.Croatia’s Vekic, ranked two places below Konta in the current rankings at No 45, struggled with her serve in the first set but the British player was unable to take advantage and dropped her own twice.Konta looked to have turned things around in the second set, cutting out the errors and establishing a seemingly-decisive lead.

But rather than carry it to and from lectures all the time, we wondered if it would be worth investing in a tablet or smaller 2-in-1 laptop with a stylus for note taking. Or do you think it would be better to stick with a small screen laptop? MattThere are two issues here that go well beyond product choice, and can only be decided by you and your daughter. The first is whether a change in circumstances – going to university – requires the adoption of a new technology, whether it be a tablet or stylus or both. I’m assuming that your daughter doesn’t use either of these, or you would already know the answer.The second issue is how a new device fits in with the ones she already uses. The days when everybody did everything with a desktop PC have long gone, and most people use a mixture of microprocessor-powered devices. These include smartphones, handhelds, tablets, Chromebooks, laptops, all-in-ones, desktops, workstations, games consoles and NAS servers, sometimes supplemented with smartpens and digital watches, cameras and recorders.For example, it wouldn’t be very useful to run a system that comprised a 6in smartphone, a 7in or 8in tablet and a 10in laptop. If you were starting from scratch, I’d suggest a 6in smartphone, a 10-12in touch-screen convertible and a desktop PC or all-in-one with a 24in or 27in screen. That’s the kind of system I use myself. There’s not much overlap between the three devices, and you get the maximum value out of each one.You should also think about integration. I’m assuming your daughter has a Windows laptop, because Apple users always mention it. If she has a MacBook Pro and an iPhone, she could easily integrate an iPad or, preferably, an iPad Pro with a Smart Keyboard. Those wouldn’t be obvious choices for someone with an Android smartphone and a Windows laptop.I’m not saying you shouldn’t buy any particular product, just that you should think about how they all work together.At one time, lots of us used styli with handheld organisers or PDAs (personal digital assistants) like the Palm and Pocket PC devices that were popular before smartphones swept the market. There were two reasons for this. First, we didn’t have capacitive screens that worked well with fingers. Second, the user interfaces required more precision than finger ends allowed. The stylus was really a mouse substitute. User interfaces had to be redesigned to make programs finger-friendly. This also added something you didn’t get with a stylus: the ability to use more than one finger at a time.While the Pocket PC and Windows XP Tablet Edition provided pretty good character recognition, the stylus has never really been comfortable for extended note-taking. People try it but most of them soon give up. In my case, I switched to a Livescribe smartpen, which has the advantage of recording talks and interviews while you handwrite notes on special paper. (Other smartpens are available.) After that I went back to using reporters’ notebooks while recording things with a separate digital recorder.More recent research from Princeton University found that students who take longhand notes learn better than the ones who take notes on a laptop.I’d therefore suggest your daughter sticks with the familiar notebook and pen paradigm, and perhaps adds a digital recorder. (You can record things with a smartphone, but recording for several hours a day runs the battery down.)My occasional need to turn cursive handwriting into text was solved by speech recognition on Android smartphones or Chrome browsers. (Other speech-to-text systems are available.)Tablets have been around for decades – the GridPad was launched in 1989 – but consumer sales only took off when Apple launched the iPad in 2010. However, sales peaked in 2014, and the market has declined since then. Some regular users will stick with them because they’ve adapted to various apps, and they are terrific for toddlers, but most of us have given up on the idea that tablets can replace laptops.The tablet market has also been disrupted by the growth of Windows 2-in-1s and convertibles. They aren’t great tablets, but they work well enough to replace dedicated tablets while still functioning as laptops.Perhaps even more damage has been done by the growth in smartphone screens: even Apple has launched an iPhone with a 6.5in screen. Apps and websites now cater so well for big smartphones that tablets are becoming increasingly irrelevant.Perhaps your daughter could try this minimalist system and see how it goes. She will soon find out whether she needs a bigger screen and a better keyboard while out and about.You can get a lot done with a smartphone, a mini-keyboard and voice recognition. However, it’s not good for writing essays because you just can’t see enough words on the screen, and editing – moving blocks of text around – is painful. If your daughter needs to do any writing or serious research on campus then there’s no substitute for a 10in or preferably larger screen. In this case, the options include tablets, Chromebooks, and Windows 2-in-1s and convertibles.In reality, there’s not that much difference in price. Cheap tablets are generally awful, and by the time you’ve bought a decent keyboardcase, you might as well have bought a proper 2-in-1.Good Chromebooks are about the same price as Windows laptops, and may sport much the same hardware, but most of them don’t have touch screens. The main advantages are the elimination of maintenance, such as installing updates, and possibly better battery life. The inherent lack of functionality should not be a problem because the Chromebook is supplementing a laptop, not trying to replace it.Windows 2-in-1s have the advantage of being portable, they can double as tablets, and can still run the full Microsoft Office and other software for working on the go. And your daughter, I assume, already knows how to use one. The main drawback is the maintenance, but that’s not a problem if the device works correctly when using an external hard drive for Windows updates.One alternative is the 10.6in Samsung Galaxy Book SM-W620, which includes a keyboardcase and S Pen for £399.97.All of these machines have Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixel) screens.Have you got a question?

I think I will probably find an excuse and the deputy mayor will come to work that day.”Another mayor, Ole Bjørstorp of Ishøj, said the demand was unreasonable and unconstitutional. “I’m obliged to take into consideration the fact that we have freedom of religion in Denmark. That’s the decisive factor for me,” he said.The proposal to include a mandatory handshake in the new citizenship ceremony was tabled by the Conservatives, a member of the three-party coalition, and the far-right Danish People’s party (DPP), on whose parliamentary support the minority government depends.It has the backing of several prominent government figures. “A handshake is how we greet each other in Denmark,” the hardline immigration minister, Inger Støjberg, of the Venstre party, the senior coalition partner, said this month. “It’s the way we show respect for each other in this country.”Some Muslims do not shake hands for religious reasons, preferring instead to place a hand on their chest in a gesture of polite greeting. The practice has caused problems in several countries including Denmark, where in 2015 a taxi driver won DKK10,000 (now about £1,200) in compensation after being sacked for refusing to shake his female employer’s hand.In Switzerland last month, a Muslim couple were denied citizenship because they refused to shake hands with members of the opposite sex at interviews. In Sweden a woman was awarded SEK40,000 (£3,400) after her job interview was cut short when she refused to shake hands with a male interviewer. France’s top court ruled this year that an Algerian woman’s refusal to shake hands with male officials at a naturalisation ceremony was reason enough to deny her citizenship.Denmark’s immigration and integration policies have shifted significantly to the right in recent years, accompanied by a rise in anti-Islam rhetoric from even the left-leaning Social Democrats, who have called the religion a barrier to integration and said some Muslims did not respect Denmark’s judicial system and some Muslim women were choosing not to work for religious reasons.Parliament has broadly backed the new citizenship bill, which introduces a naturalisation ceremony at which applicants must sign a document pledging to uphold the constitution, commit to core Danish values and “act respectfully towards representatives of the authorities” – which the conservative parties insist means shaking hands.The DPP’s immigration spokesman, Martin Henriksen, said a handshake amounted to “a compromise about acting with respect. That, in our view, certainly means shaking the hand of the mayor or other person conducting the ceremony.” He said he expected parliament to back the proposal.The Conservative party spokesman, Naser Khader, said this month: “The package includes a ceremony at which you make a statement of loyalty and shake hands.” He said he did not expect problems. “Some people would give their right arm for citizenship. I’m sure they’d also give their hand.”The Social Democrats have said they believe a handshake is important and “completely natural”, but the party’s leader, Mette Frederiksen, has expressed doubts about the need to make it mandatory.“We make too many laws in Denmark,” she told the state broadcaster DR. “The ceremony is what’s important to me. If there turns out to be problems with the handshake, we should discuss legislating then.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28d5891947777bef0c1a781698681feefe934584/0_97_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61eeb392dc65f6ce8bf7bfeaef2319b1","title":"dream come true moon jae in korean leaders mountain pilgrimage","story":"South Korean president’s visit to North concludes with highly symbolic trip to Mount PaektuMoon Jae-in, the South Korean president, stepped into the shallow waters of Heaven Lake, regarded as the spiritual home of the Korean people, bent down and scooped up a glassful of water.Kim Jong-un, his North Korean counterpart, watched from a distance. Moon was fulfilling a long-held dream to visit Mount Paektu, which straddles the border between North Korea and China. At the summit the two men held hands and thrust them into the air as they posed for a photo with their wives, the lake in the background.The highly symbolic trip capped a three-day visit by Moon to North Korea, the first by a South Korean leader in 11 years. After two days of talks, Kim pledged to close a missile testing site that was crucial to North Korea’s development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and offered to shut the country’s only known nuclear complex in exchanged for unspecified “reciprocal measures” from the US.Observers said these measure fell short of expectations in Washington. But inter-Korean relations continue to grow closer, and the trip to Paektu highlighted the close relationship between the two leaders.Kim hopes to restart negotiations with the US, and hopes to have a second summit with Donald Trump as soon as possible, Moon told reporters when he returned to Seoul. Kim also invited secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Pyonyang, Moon said.“Chairman Kim expressed his wish to finish complete denuclearization at an early date and focus on economic development,” Moon said, adding that details would have to be worked out between North Koreans and the US.But US officials have made little progress with the most basic of discussions, such as having North Korea provide an inventory of its nuclear which would become the basis for future talks. Moon said North Korea is ready to accelerate the denuclearisation process, but only if the US makes reciprocal measures, which have not been defined.If negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang continue to hit roadblocks, it could jeoprdise inter-Korean exchanges since sanctions will likely remain in place. It did not stop Kim from trying to win over the South Korean president, sending him two tons of pine mushrooms, a delicacy.Moon is an avid hiker and during his first meeting with Kim, in April, he had expressed his desire to visit the mountain, the highest on the Korean peninsula at 2,500 metres (9,000ft).“I have a dream that I have not been able to fulfil for a long time, which is trekking Mount Paektu,” Moon said at the time. “I believe Chairman Kim will make that dream come true for sure.”The trip to the summit on a sunny morning was less of a trek than a photo op. Both Kim and Moon wore black overcoats and black leather dress shoes, and they travelled to the top by cable car. Outings like this have helped build trust between the two men, something Kim still lacks in his relationship with Trump.The mountain is featured heavily in North Korean propaganda, and Kim has made trips to its summit after nuclear tests or major announcements, most recently when he declared the country’s nuclear arsenal complete. North Korea’s two previous leaders, Kim’s grandfather and father, are said to have been born in its shadow. This has been used to bolster the Kim family’s claim to a sacred bloodline, though the account has been disputed by some.Paektu is also a significant symbol in the South, where it is mentioned in the country’s national anthem. Although Moon could have visited the summit sooner from the Chinese side, he had wanted to go by “stepping on our soil”, Kim Eui-kyeom, a South Korean presidential spokesman, said at a briefing.Moon was scheduled to fly back to Seoul on Thursday afternoon and he will meet Trump in New York next week during the UN general assembly, and Moon said he has a private message from Kim to deliver. The US has invited North Korea’s foreign minister to meet the secretary of state next week in an attempt to restart talks between Washington and Pyongyang."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daccc9085355858fadcbb575ffd6e50bc7066d04/0_336_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2e4d5933fedbf67c6542b704b4dde83","title":"uganda pop star politician bobi wine returns us","story":"Bobi Wine flies home from US, where he received medical treatment after being beaten in detentionBobi Wine, the Ugandan pop star turned opposition politician whose beating by soldiers last month prompted mass protests, has been welcomed by a large group of jubilant supporters on his return to the country from the US.Wine’s associates feared he had been arrested after he was separated from other passengers before immigration controls and prevented from seeing his lawyers at Entebbe international airport, then escorted by police to a waiting vehicle. However the 36-year-old was later seen addressing crowds outside his home in the capital, Kampala.In a statement police said that Wine, who faces a trial on treason charges next month, had been “peacefully escorted to his residence”.“We wish to thank him for cooperating with the police,” the statement said. “We urge all people to remain calm.

Demonstrations have been banned and TV networks told not to report live on Wine’s return.Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, has been receiving medical treatment in the US for injuries sustained following his arrest on 14 August.He had been detained after the motorcade of Uganda’s veteran president, Yoweri Museveni, was stoned in Arua, a northern town, during campaigning for byelections. He was badly beaten, kept in a military barracks without proper medical attention and then produced in court to face treason charges. His driver was shot dead.Analysts say the 36-year-old politician poses the most significant challenge in years to Museveni, who leads a country with one of the youngest populations in the world.The former reggae singer, who was elected to parliament last year, has emerged as a powerful voice with his calls for young people in the east African country to stand up and take over from a “failed leadership”.Earlier this week Wine told the  he wanted to prove that the “power of the people is greater than the people in power”. “If I think about the dangers that face me, it is crazy to go back. But I want to be home. There are 40 million people who need hope so I will go and meet them no matter what,” Wine said.Security forces also deployed overnight to outside the homes of opposition leaders. Police escorted Medard Ssegona, Wine’s lawyer and member of parliament, from his home to his office at parliament.Nicholas Opio, another lawyer for Wine, told the  that the situation in and around Entebbe airport on Thursday was “tense”.A number of journalists who had travelled to the airport had their equipment confiscated. “The journalists have not been formally arrested but their equipment has been confiscated and their identity cards taken,” Opio said.Musician friends of Wine who attempted to travel to Entebbe to welcome him home were also held by police. Witnesses said soldiers and police deployed along the entire length of the road between Kampala and Entebbe town, about 30 miles south.On his Twitter feed, Wine describes himself as “one ghetto child who has something to say through music”. Many of his songs deal with social and political issues, calling for ordinary young people to act to improve their lives and their country.He has compared himself to France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and made no secret of his presidential ambitions. However, the singer is controversial and has faced repeated accusations of homophobia.More than 80 artists, activists and politicians signed a statement condemning his treatment in detention. There were also protests in other countries in Africa, the UK and the US.Analysts say it is likely that the Ugandan authorities did not expect him to return when they allowed him to fly to the US.Nick Cheeseman, professor of democracy at the University of Birmingham and an expert in African politics, said Wine will have to reach more voters if he is to mount a serious challenge to Museveni.“You need more than charisma and a bit of a following among the urban youth. You need a nationwide structure and a lot of money. Uganda remains a predominantly rural country,” he said.Museveni, who took power in 1986 and is a key US security ally, has become increasingly authoritarian in recent years. The 74-year-old president is able to seek re-election in 2021 because parliament passed legislation last year removing a clause in the constitution that had prevented anyone over 75 from holding the presidency.Demonstrations following Wine’s detention last month were repressed by riot police and other security forces. Three people died and around 100 were arrested.The US, EU and UK have been critical of the treatment of Wine, a sign that long-standing support may be ebbing as observers worry about growing instability."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3636045.1537456782!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"orla tinsley documentary led to surge in donor card requests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Irish Kidney Association confirmed the spike following the broadcast of Orla Tinsley: Warrior on RTE One on Monday.There were more than 5,000 requests for organ donor cards in the three days following an RTÉ documentary featuring cystic fibrosis campaigner Orla Tinsley. The Irish Kidney Association confirmed the spike followed Orla Tinsley: Warrior, which aired on RTÉ One on Monday. It was followed directly afterwards with an audience discussion on the Claire Byrne Live programme.The Irish Kidney Association said requests for donor cards came “via free text” and requests to the association’s website. It said many inidual requests were for multiples of donor cards.The organisation also received many further requests via email and by phone to its headquarters. Irish Kidney Association chief executive Mark Murphy said that “on a normal day” the association receives between 20 and 50 requests for organ donor cards.“The public’s interest in organ donation has dramatically spiked since CF campaigner Orla Tinsley’s documentary was aired on Monday,” he said. “Such a level of public response has not been seen for almost a decade.“Orla’s courage has moved the public in such a powerful and visceral way to support organ donation.“This gives hope to the 600 or more people on transplant waiting lists and their families and demonstrates, once again, how powerful inidual stories shared by people who have been touched by organ failure and organ donation can capture the public’s empathy.“We hope that the public will continue to have that vital discussion about organ donation with their loved ones and let their wishes be known.” The documentary was filmed over 14 months in New York and charted Ms Tinsley’s struggle while her cystic fibrosis worsened as she awaited a life-saving double lung transplant, which she finally secured following a number of false alarms.Members of the public can request an organ donor card texting DONOR to 50050, or via the Irish Kidney Association website www.ika.ie.The “digital organ donor card” is available from the Google playstore or iTunes. “Your wishes can also be recorded when applying for the new format drivers’ licence and code 115 will be put on your new licence,” said Mr Murphy."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3635602.1537445610!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"detailed backstop proposals urgently needed varadkar tells may","story":"Speaking at an EU leaders summit in Salzburg, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that the Irish Government is preparing for the possibility that the EU and UK fail to agree a Brexit deal. Video: EU Commission\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                             Theresa May and Leo Varadkar attend a bilateral meeting during the informal summit of European Union leaders in Salzburg, Austria on Thursday. Photograph: Leonhard FoegerReuters The UK needs to put detailed proposals on the backstop on the negotiating table urgently, the Taoiseach told the British prime minister today.Time was short, Mr Varadkar is reported to have warned, insisting they need to get to discuss legal text.Meeting this morning on the fringes of the Salzburg European Summit Mr Varadkar told Mrs May that although the UK and the EU’s task force have both presented some proposals at this stage, the British proposals are only an outline.Irish and EU negotiators have yet to see specific details from the British side and there is a need to get into detailed discussions urgently. The Taoiseach told Ms May his objective remains the same: to achieve a legally operable and robust backstop within the Withdrawal Agreement, that ensures no hard border on the island of Ireland.Ms May is understood to have expressed doubts about whether it will be possible to conclude the discussions by the October summit but said she was keen to bring negotiations to a conclusion as soon as possible.The EU leaders are expected this afternoon to agree to a new November Brexit summit but to emphasise that October remains the target for resolving most of the issues around the Withdrawal Agreement, what chief negotiator Mr Michel Barnier has called the “moment of truth”.Irish sources said the meeting had been “useful”. In the discussion on Northern Ireland Mr Varadkar emphasised the need to get talks underway between the parties.Meanwhile Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said Brexit is a “damage limitation exercise” for everyone involved and a “lose, lose, lose” situation.He also suggested on Thursday Britain’s standing in the world would be diminished because of the loss of solidarity and support from EU members.“For the EU we will undoubtedly be weakened without the British economy and the British political system advocating for globalisation, providing a bulwark against protectionism, and making sure the single market works fairly for everybody,” he told the PwC tax summit in Dublin this morning.“Britain has been the champion of all these things and the EU without Britain, in my view, is a weaker place,” he said.“From an Irish perspective, it’s a lose too,” Mr Coveney said, noting the considerable amount of contingency planning for different eventualities that was being put in place.Later Mr Coveney said the Government was willing to be flexible on the “backstop” - which has ground down EU-UK negotiations on a Brexit treaty - as long as it meets commitments given by London.Answering questions at the media announcement of public information event to get businesses ready for Brexit, the Tánaiste called for an “intensification” in negotiations between the EU and the UK around a legal text on the so-called backstop guarantee to avoid a hard border in Ireland.Describing talks as being at “the business end of negotiations,” Mr Coveney said it was always going to be difficult to conclude talks but said the decision of the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to rewrite its proposed text on the backstop was an attempt to address the UK’s concerns.Despite agreeing in last December’s political agreement to include the backstop in the Brexit treaty, the UK has rejected the EU’s proposed text because it would keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union and parts of the single market and create a border between the North and the rest of the UK.An intensification of negotiations was required, instead of “political commentary and political lobbying,” said Mr Coveney, “so we can get into the nuts and bolts of trying to resolve the UK’s problems here.”The Tánaiste rejected a suggestion, as reported by news wire Bloomberg this week, that some EU members may press Ireland to drop its opposition to corporate tax reforms in return for the bloc backing the Government on Brexit. This was “not some kind of quid pro quo,” he said.“To link the two is simply not accurate,” he said.He remarked that there were “enough challenges with Brexit without creating new ones that aren’t there.”“It is far too serious and too significant an issue its own right for that kind of conversation to be taking place,” he told reporters.Mr Coveney was speaking at the Government’s announcement of a series public information meetings, which he called “Brexpos”, to be held in Cork, Galway, Monaghan and Dublin next month as part of a revamped Brexit response plan called “Getting Ireland Brexit Ready.”The Government’s preparations for a potential no-deal Brexit “should not be interpreted as a reflection of the state of play in the negotiations or in any way prejudge the outcome,” he said.“We have got to move ahead with preparations to ensure that we have an appropriate response to various different scenarios that may unfold,” he said.The plan includes initiatives already announced by the Government, including a €300 million Brexit Loan Scheme that provides financing of between €25,000 and €1.5 million to businesses affected by Brexit.Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys did not answer a question about how much had been drawn down under the scheme, launched at the end of March.She said that 151 applications for loans had been made and that of those 132 were eligible, of which 10 had been sanctioned. She would have more up to date figures by the end of September, she said.Clarity about the border issue must be agreed before any further discussions on Brexit go ahead maintains former taoiseach Bertie Ahern.Anything else “will be a disaster” and he issue “needs to be tied down” he told RTE’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show.Mr Ahern said Ms May will have to make concessions, but she would not admit that before the forthcoming Tory conference. “We might have to make some concessions. Every week that goes by weakens our position. The British have successfully dragged it out.“She’s done one hell of a job of dragging it out.”He also said that “the DUP isn’t as stringent as people say. They are realistic people. They know it has to be a frictionless border. They know there has to be give and take.” The sensible thing for the UK to do is to stay within the Customs Union, he added.An agreement needs to be tied down for a frictionless, open border, with freedom to trade between north and south with no regulations. There are still five weeks to reach an agreement, said Mr Ahern.But he warned that the nearer the deadline approaches the greater the prospect of compromise. If the British government wants the same terms for the rest of the UK as have been proposed for Northern Ireland then why do they want to leave the Customs Union, he asked. Ms May is playing a short-term game, he added.It is important for the EU coalition to maintain its support for Ireland. No future discussions should be allowed go ahead until there is “absolute clarity” about what will happen on January 1st 2021. “If this issue is allowed to be pushed into the future relations discussion it will be a disaster,” he warned.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryEPATo become a “normal country” is the dream of more than one republic. The world is familiar enough with the German case. Having atoned for the war and put Europe first, its next step as a common-or-garden nation is to pursue its narrow interests without embarrassment.Because he is so peculiar, we cannot credit that Donald Trump’s project is the normalisation of his own country. For all their shock value, that is what his foreign policies amount to: the restoration of the US as a selfish state among selfish states, not an overworked governess with the entire free world as her mewling wards.This realpolitik can be self-defeating. It misses the national interests that are served through such nominally high-minded works as the Paris climate accord. But it is still more coherent than its critics. Liberals chafed at American power until its threatened retreat, at which point Nato and the Washington Consensus on trade became sacraments to be saved from populist menaces. As for mainstream Republicans, at least Trump does not go in for mystical hokum about the US as a special nation ordained to uphold freedom.Realism has more going for it, though, than internal coherence. It also fits the external conditions. To lead a world order takes a nation in the full plumage of its powers. That is a better description of the US in 1948 than 2018, much less 2048. Trump’s infidelity to the postwar system is disquieting, but perhaps he is doing through choice what future presidents will have to do through necessity.Pax Americana is not the natural order of things. It is a phase born of the most extreme circumstances. The US accounted for a third of the world’s output when it set up the Bretton Woods institutions, revived Japan and secured Europe. Because its absolute power remained so awesome, we forget that its relative position began to decline soon after. It now accounts for about 20 per cent of global output. It does not have the wherewithal to underwrite the democratic world forever. At some point, a president was going to construe the national interest in narrower terms. The most recent three were elected on a pledge to do so.Whether Trump-as-statesman understands the relative decline he has lived through – he was born in 1946 – Trump-as-politician understands something just as relevant. The taxpayer still awaits the peace idend that was said to be in the mail when the Berlin Wall turned to debris.The US has spent most of the post-cold war era in expensive conflicts in another hemisphere. These “forever wars” rolled on as the home land endured a financial crash and the kind of infrastructure that should be beneath the dignity of the nation that built the Hoover dam.The two trends – relative decline and domestic exhaustion – have created the best atmosphere for realpolitik since the post-Vietnam years. The difference is that this time it should last, as China and other powers trim America’s room for manoeuvre.There is no demand for isolation. There is plenty for a focus on interests over values. Trump’s is the first (and therefore the worst) attempt to service that demand. There was no need to humiliate allies as blameless as Canada or to impose, as his government did this week, new limits on the annual intake of refugees. But the underlying logic of selfishness will outlast him.Realists smell a chance to temper the crudities of America First into a serious, interest-led, foreign policy. The foremost among their academic tribe, John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, each have books out to encourage their nation’s retirement from “liberal hegemony”.Even if the coming realism turns out to be an over-correction, a correction was due. Not long ago, George W Bush could describe freedom as the “design of nature” and Barack Obama could, with equal nonchalance, say that the arc of history bends towards justice. The arc of history does not bend towards anything.There are things to miss about these presidents – their personal class, their seasoned cabinets – but this teleological gibberish is not one of them. The postwar record suggests that ideals get the US into trouble more often than cold calculation does.Richard Nixon said that a leader can, at most, “give history a nudge”. He or she cannot alter the course of history so much as quicken a trend that is already in train. The structural trends of the world demand a more self-interested US over time.Each of Trump’s broken treaties and tariff rounds can be read as a nudge towards that destiny: a bid to make America normal again. His successors will do it better. But they will do it. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/20/TELEMMGLPICT000166215862_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqFHJPQB5kSs70svgyy-w7x2r8wcvaJ-sPwpANK01m1-g.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"elderly households set soar younger people struggle join housing","story":"The ONS revised down its previous projection, made in 2014, which suggested that 210,000 new households would be formed per year, to 159,000 per year.   Buy to letThe number of elderly households is set to soar in the next 25 years as younger people struggle to get on the property ladder, ONS data suggests. Projections suggest that households headed by over 85-year-olds will more than double by 2041, to 2.04m, from just under one million in 2016.Younger households are set to stay the same or even fall, with households headed by someone aged 65 or over making up 88 per cent of growth by 2041. The ONS had revised down its previous projection, made in 2014, which suggested that 210,000 new households would be formed per year, to 159,000 per year. Joanna Harkrader, of its centre for ageing and demography, said the change reflects lower projections of the population – notably assumptions around future births, how long we’ll live and migration – and more up-to-date figures about living arrangements, such as living with parents or cohabiting.Projected number of householdsEconomists argued that the slowing growth was partly down to young people\u0027s inability to leave home. Daniel Bentley, editorial director at Civitas, said the projections were based on figures which reflected a decline in homeownership since 2001 due to problems with affordability. In the 1990s, people in their twenties used to buy a home, as their first home, in much greater numbers than they do today. How households will changeToday, if that option is less available to you, then you are less likely to move out of your parents\u0027, he said. However, Ian Mulheirn, director of consulting at Oxford Economics, said the figures suggested that Governmental housebuilding projects had planned for more new homes than were needed. People don\u0027t move out to buy, they move out to rent, he said. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much evidence that young people\u0027s decision to stay at home is because of the cost of housing.Buy to letWestminster attacker turned into \u0026#39Incredible Hulk\u0026#39 over chicken dinner, his mother tells inquest\u0026#39It will not work\u0026#39 - EU leaders reject Theresa May\u0026#39s Chequers proposal for BrexitSNP government vows to fight Alex Salmond court action over sexual misconduct complaints procedureIndian village bans Muslim names for children, public prayer and beards after row over dead calf Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s mother hails \u0026#39power of women\u0026#39 as she is surprise guest at Grenfell book launch Marine Le Pen ordered to undergo psychiatric tests for tweeting images of Isil atrocities English National Ballet star attacked for refusing to wear pink tights on stageColombian peace deal at risk as cocaine production surges to record levelsComment: Only serious competition will fix our broken railway systemComment: Left-wingers love a conspiracy theory - it\u0026#39s a distraction from the real reasons for their failureComment: Chequers won\u0026#39t be the last concession.

For denouncing the horrors of Daesh in tweets, the \u0027justice system\u0027 is putting me through psychiatric tests! Just how far will they go? she said in another tweet, using the Arabic acronym for Isil.This regime is really starting to be frightening, she wrote in a further post, suggesting that the case was part of a government plot to discredit her.Later the leader of the National Rally (formerly the Front National), who lost to the centrist Emmanuel Macron in last year\u0027s presidential election, spoke to journalists in the corridors of the National Assembly to say she would not attend any evaluation.“I’m waiting to see how the magistrates plan to force me to do it,” said Ms Le Pen.The court order was dated 11 September and requested that the tests be carried out as soon as possible to determine whether the 50-year-old is capable of understanding remarks and answering questions.Ms Le Pen also argued that obligatory psychiatric evaluation was usually reserved for sex offenders and paedophiles.Murdered US journalist James Foley\u0026#39s parents accused Ms Le Pen of using their son’s \u0026#34shamefully uncensored\u0026#34 image for political gainAt the time, Mr Foley\u0027s parents accused Ms Le Pen of using their son’s shamefully uncensored image for political gain.Ms Le Pen later deleted the photograph from her account and claimed she did not know it showed Mr Foley when she tweeted it. She said she removed it immediately after his family complained.Mr Foley, a freelance reporter, was abducted in Syria in 2012 and beheaded in August 2014.Ms Le Pen had shared the images in response to a French journalist who drew a comparison between Isil and her anti-immigrant, anti-Islam, eurosceptic party.Brexit Bulletin: Pouring Salz on the woundWestminster attacker turned into \u0026#39Incredible Hulk\u0026#39 over chicken dinner, his mother tells inquest\u0026#39It will not work\u0026#39 - EU leaders reject Theresa May\u0026#39s Chequers proposal for BrexitSNP government vows to fight Alex Salmond court action over sexual misconduct complaints procedureIndian village bans Muslim names for children, public prayer and beards after row over dead calf Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s mother hails \u0026#39power of women\u0026#39 as she is surprise guest at Grenfell book launch English National Ballet star attacked for refusing to wear pink tights on stageColombian peace deal at risk as cocaine production surges to record levelsComment: Only serious competition will fix our broken railway systemComment: Left-wingers love a conspiracy theory - it\u0026#39s a distraction from the real reasons for their failureComment: Chequers won\u0026#39t be the last concession.

She had two things going for her. She had clear-cut chops, and she was pretty, too. But what happened to her? Where did she go?”Chase has been a controversial in recent years, with his comments on the set of the TV show Community, as revealed by Donald Glover, being criticised.\u0026nbsp“People think you’re funnier because you’re black,” he allegedly told the actor.

Gallagher has been shortlisted two times before with his former band, Oasis.\u0026nbspRapper Novelist appears on the shortlist for the first time with his self-produced debut album Novelist Guy, which has influences as wide-ranging as the Pet Shop Boys and the soundtrack for 80s TV show Beverly Hills Cop, and\u0026nbspfeatures astute social commentary about youth culture in the UK.\u0026nbspNovelist and singer Jorja Smith are the youngest artists on this year’s shortlist, both aged 21: Smith was shortlisted for her debut album Lost \u0026amp Found, released in June this year. She was consistently named through 2017 as one of the UK’s most promising new artists and was featured twice on Drake’s album More Life, supporting him in the UK and Canada. She won the Brit Critics’ Choice Award in January this year.\u0026nbspArguably one of the more surprising appearances is Lily Allen earning her first ever Mercury Prize nod for her anticipated fourth studio album No Shame, which The Independent hailed as a “return to form” following the lukewarm reception to her previous record Sheezus.\u0026nbsp“She’s managed to move with the times but still hold onto a sound that defines her as an artist, rather than attempting to emulate anyone else… that freshness is enabled by the fact that she still, after all this time, has the finger on the pulse of modern music,” The Independent review said.\u0026nbspKing Krule (singer-songwriter Archy Marshall) received his first Mercury Prize nomination for third album The Ooz, which made The Independent’s Albums of the Year 2017 list. Nadine Shah was another newcomer on the Mercury Prize shortlist, for her record Holiday Destination.\u0026nbspBritish jazz group Sons of Kemet – formed of Shabaka Hutchings, Eddie Hick, Tom Skinner and Theon Cross,\u0026nbspreceived a nod for their album Your Queen Is A Reptile.

They now intend to examine the data in greater depth to learn more about the Milky Way’s history.“The discovery was easy the interpretations harder. And the full understanding of its meaning and implications might take several years,” Said Dr Amina Helmi from the University of Groningen, who also contributed to the research.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/19/12/milky-way.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/19/12/milky-way.jpg","title":"neutron star infrared light nasa hubble space telescope","story":"Created with Sketch.Bright glow \u0027could change our general understanding of neutron star evolution\u0027Click to followThe IndependentArtist\u0027s impression showing infrared radiation coming from a neutron starNasa detects \u0027unusual\u0027 infrared light from mysterious neutron starA neutron star in the depths of space has been detected\u0026nbspbeaming out abnormally\u0026nbspbright infrared radiation, in a development that has left astronomers perplexed.The distant phenomenon was spotted using Nasa’s Hubble Space Telescope, and the team behind the discovery hope it will help them understand the development of these super-dense stars.Neutron stars are objects formed from the collapsed cores of large stars following a supernova explosion. They are also known as pulsars due to the pulses of radiation they emit as they rotate at high speeds.These stars are generally examined using radio wave and X-rays, and researchers say\u0026nbspthe addition of the infrared spectrum to their studies opens up a wide range\u0026nbspof new possibilities.This specific object, known as RX J0806.4-4123, belongs to a group of pulsars known as “the magnificent seven” that scientists say\u0026nbspare far hotter than they ought to be considering their age.As for the source of its bright glow, the researchers think there must be something else interacting with the neutron star to create this effect.“One theory is that there could be what is known as a ‘fallback disc’ of material that coalesced around the neutron star after the supernova,” said Professor Bettina Posselt, an astrophysicist at Pennsylvania State and the leader of the team that identified the distant glow.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

By contrast, “centre left”, “centre” and “centre right” parties are all seen as equally competent.\u0026nbspI left Labour for the Lib Dems because Corbyn isn\u0027t radical enoughSenior Corbyn ally criticises activists over Iran and Saudi ArabiaProfessor Johns suggests two likely reasons for the link between moderation and competence: that moderate parties are seen as readier to compromise, and that they are more realistic about what can be achieved.“Our results suggest that a Labour Party in Jeremy Corbyn’s ideological image faces a disadvantage at election time. As in 2017, this can be partly overcome by the considerable popularity of specific left-wing policies. Nevertheless, the widespread view that the party is well to the left does take a toll on its reputation for governing competence. The same will be true of the Conservatives if, as may well happen in the post-Brexit shake-up, they are perceived as drifting further to the right.”Professor Johns said he recognised that Labour had exceeded expectations in the 2017 election, and that there might be “advantages to a clear and strong ideological message”.\u0026nbspBut his research was designed to separate perceptions of ideology\u0026nbspfrom other perceptions of the current parties: “The true effect of ideological stance on perceived competence has always been hard to pin down because there are too many other factors at play – for example, the personality and capacity of leaders like Tony Blair and Jeremy Corbyn themselves – that might have driven their parties’ competence ratings. The best way of isolating the impact of ideology is to hold those other factors constant in a survey experiment.”UK news in picturesChris Evans’ wife Natasha Shishmanian has given birth to twins, a boy and girl affectionately nicknamed “Ping and Pong” throughout the pregnancy.Storm Ali has hit the British Isles bringing winds of up to 100mph.

Respondents were given random descriptions of two hypothetical parties – whether the party was in government, its issue priorities, its current poll rating, the sex of its leader, how united or ided it is, and its “political outlook”.\u0026nbspThis last item consisted of seven categories ranging from “very left wing” to “very right wing”. Finally, people were then asked to choose which of the two parties they thought was more competent. The analysis found the most extreme left-right labels carried a significant “competence penalty”.\u0026nbspRespondents were also asked to place themselves of the left-right scale, and tended to rate parties closer to their own position as more competent. But, regardless of their own position, they also tended to rate the party closer to the centre as more competent.Professor Johns said: “Being seen as a competent government-in-waiting is central to the Corbyn strategy.

Used fur products would be exempt.The council is considering an exemption for products used for religious purposes, such as fur hats worn by Orthodox Jews,\u0026nbspas well as for items made from pelts legally taken under the authority of a California fur-trapping license.Major fashion companies, including Michael Kors, Armani and Gucci, have also moved away from using fur. Earlier this month, Burberry said it would stop selling real fur.\u0026nbspActivists have condemned the fur industry as inhumane, arguing that the animals are subject to brutal conditions and torturous deaths.However, Keith Kaplan, a spokesman for the Fur Information Council of America, said that while full-length coats of sable and mink may not be as popular as they once were, fur is still found in around 70 per cent of the world’s latest autumn fashion collections.“If consumers weren’t buying it, fashion houses wouldn’t be designing it, and manufacturers wouldn’t be making it,” he said.He also disputed as “bogus” claims by animal rights groups that the methods employed by the fur industry are inherently cruel and inhumane.Retail fur sales globally accounted for $35.8bn (£27.2bn), and the fur industry employed more than one\u0026nbspmillion people in 2014, the latest year figures were available from the industry, Mr Kaplan said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMPs to ban import of animal furResponding to news of the ban, Humane Society International (HSI) called on the British government to work towards making the UK the first country in the world to ban the sale of animal fur.Farming fur was made illegal in the UK in 2000, and EU law bans fur from domestic cats, dogs and hunted seals. However, Britain imports fur from other species including foxes and rabbits.Claire Bass, HSI UK’s executive director, said:\u0026nbsp“A cruel product like fur has no place in the City of Angels, and we applaud the Los Angeles City council for taking a moral stand.“Now it is time for the UK government to show equal compassion and listen to the vast majority of British people who want the UK to become the first country in the world to fully ban the sale of animal fur.“Our government has stated its ambition for the UK\u0026nbspto be ‘a world leader in animal welfare’, blazing a trail as the first country to outlaw the cruel and unnecessary fur trade would show that this ambition will be delivered with actions, not just words. The sale of cat, dog and seal fur is already banned here so now let’s finish the job and ban fur full stop.”Additional reporting by agenciesEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/28/10/nawaz-sharif2.jpg","title":"nawaz sharif impeachment ex prime minister pakistan release suspended sentence","story":"Created with Sketch.Decision follows three-time prime minister\u0027s disqualification\u0026nbspfrom holding office by Supreme Court in July 2017Click to followThe IndependentOn Wednesday, the Islamabad High Court suspended the 10-year sentence for disgraced former prime minister Nawaz Sharif A Pakistani court has ordered the release of jailed former prime minister\u0026nbspNawaz\u0026nbspSharif\u0026nbspand his daughter, suspending the sentences they received from a lower court in July and prompting celebrations among supporters waiting outside.On\u0026nbspWednesday,\u0026nbspthe Islamabad High Court suspended the 10-year sentence for\u0026nbspSharif\u0026nbspand the seven-year term handed\u0026nbspto his daughter, Maryam, over corrupt practices linked to his family’s ownership of upscale London flats.“Justice has been served and I congratulate\u0026nbspNawaz\u0026nbspSharif‘s supporters,” former foreign minister Khawaja Asif, a staunch\u0026nbspSharif\u0026nbspally, said outside the courtroom where\u0026nbspSharif‘s supporters were seen celebrating wildly.The\u0026nbspSharifs’ convictions are still under appeal with the same Islamabad High Court.But a judge on Wednesday ruled they should be freed immediately while the case continues.Three-time prime minister\u0026nbspSharif\u0026nbspwas ousted and disqualified from holding office by the Supreme Court in July 2017 and jailed earlier this year in absentia.Supporters of Nawaz Sharif celebrate the suspension of his prison sentence in Lahore, Pakistan (AP)He was arrested on 13\u0026nbspJuly upon returning from London, where his wife was receiving treatment before her death this month.Sharif\u0026nbsphas repeatedly called the cases against him politically motivated, suggesting collusion between the powerful military and courts to destabilise his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz\u0026nbsp(PML-N) party and throw him out of power.World news in picturesLos Angeles has moved to ban the sale of fur within its city limits.

Turkey\u0026nbsphas amassed armoured vehicles, artillery guns, and tanks along the border with Syria, with some equipment moving across the frontier, according to Turkish news outlets and video footage posted to the internet.It has transferred arms and ammunition to its Free Syria Army (FSA) rebel allies, pro-Ankara newspapers reported, though some experts say the distribution of weapons won’t affect the outcome of any conflict. \u0026nbspIdlib province on 11 September in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensive (Getty)Turkey has also begun to bolster a dozen outposts it operates in and around Idlib with additional troops and military vehicles. The military positions were set up in cooperation with Russia and Iran as mechanisms worked out during a series of talks that began in the Kazakh capital of Astana to monitor local truce deals.Fears for 3m people in rebel-held Idlib ahead of regime offensiveA Syrian protester waves a flag of the opposition as during a protest against the regime and its ally Russia, in the rebel-held town of Maaret al-Numan in the north of Idlib provinceSyrian rebel fighters from the recently-formed National Liberation Front stand guard over a trench as rebels prepare defensive positions in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensiveA Syrian rebel fighter looks through an embrasure in a make-shift bunkerA Syrian protester waves a flag of the oppositionA Syrian protester waves a flag of the opposition as during a protest against the regime and its ally Russia, in the rebel-held town of Maaret al-Numan in the north of Idlib provinceSyrian rebel fighters from the recently-formed National Liberation Front stand guard over a trench as rebels prepare defensive positions in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensiveA Syrian rebel fighter looks through an embrasure in a make-shift bunkerA Syrian protester waves a flag of the opposition“These 12 observation points were equipped with limited military equipment and their main role was to monitor the agreement done in Astana,” said Nawar Oliver, a Syria specialist at the Omran Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank in Istanbul. “At the moment when the regime started to mobilise its forces around Idlib, Turkey started to send reinforcements to some of these points.”Syrian forces aided by Russian air power could easily overrun the outposts. But Turkey’s moves have upped the geopolitical cost of any attempt to take Idlib by the pro-Assad camp that includes Russia, Iran, and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, as well as Iraqi Shia militias backed by Tehran.Around three\u0026nbspmillion Syrians live in Idlib province, a hilly agricultural region by\u0026nbspthe Turkish border. Many of the displaced have resettled in the province from other parts of the country or were forcibly relocated there from opposition enclaves recaptured by Damascus.Turkey, the primary patron of the Syrian opposition and the host to 3.5 million displaced Syrians, has vehemently opposed the regime offensive to retake Idlib. The US and Europe have urged a political solution over Idlib and warned against the military campaign. US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley repeated warnings that any use of chemical weapons by the regime would trigger a response by Washington.The UK on Saturday warned of an impending humanitarian crisis amid reports of attacks on hospitals and clinics in rebel-held territory. “The UK has been clear that a man-made catastrophe in Idlib is entirely avoidable,” Alistair Burt, Middle East minister, said in a a press release. “We support the urgent diplomatic efforts being made by Turkey and the UN.”Ankara worries in part that another bloody confrontation in Syria could flood Turkey and Europe with hundreds of thousands of fresh refugees.Airstrikes in in Idlib, northwestern SyriaAlready, thousands of displaced Syrians have relocated from the southern edges of Idlib and northern Hama province to the Turkish-controlled Afrin district adjacent to the border, said a source in Afrin. On Friday, Turkey hosted a meeting of French, German\u0026nbspand Russian officials ahead of a possible meeting of those countries’ leaders over Idlib.In addition to a possible confrontation between pro-Assad forces and Turkey, Idlib could be the flashpoint for a conflict with jihadi forces that dominate parts of the province. In recent days, al-Qaeda’s international supporters on social media have also blasted fellow jihadis in Idlib for allowing Turkey to dispatch armoured vehicles and trucks carrying tanks into Syria, as depicted in videos posted on social media.A 13 September statement signed by 15 prominent al-Qaeda supporters questioned Hayat Tahrir\u0026nbspal-Sham (HTS), the jihadi group that is a dominant player in Idlib, for granting Turkey access to the province.Mr Oliver suggested Turkey could be bolstering the observation points for fear of attacks by jihadis as well as to stymie Damascus’s offensive. “The internal problems for Idlib are huge,” he said. “We are talking about an area that has FSA factions, HTS, you have Isis\u0026nbspcells, you have other small entities.”For now Turkey’s moves have complicated plans to retake Idlib. Syrian civilians have begun to mass around the bolstered observation points in hopes that they won’t be struck by government and Russian warplanes. Thousands of Syrians who have fled the attacks of the regime and Russia are settling in the areas where the Turkish army\u0027s military posts are, because they think it is safe, the pro-government Vatan newspaper reported, publishing photos showing people purported to be sheltering near the outposts.On Friday, for the second week in a row, thousands of Syrians in the province took to the streets in peaceful, colourful demonstrations that recalled the first months of the 2011 uprising against the Assad family’s decades-long dictatorship. “For the time being, everything is postponed,” Mr Oliver said. “There is no final agreement and no final disagreement.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/15/251230075-files-this-photograph-taken-on-september-12-2017-shows-rohingya-refugees-arriving-by-boat.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/15/251230075-files-this-photograph-taken-on-september-12-2017-shows-rohingya-refugees-arriving-by-boat.jpg","title":"un myanmar rohingya genocide united nations","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentInternational Criminal Court to investigate Myanmar’s Rohingya deportationsThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has launched a preliminary investigation into the Rohingya crisis to determine whether the mass deportations of Muslims from Myanmar into Bangladesh was a crime against humanity.Chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspif the evidence collected in the initial probe was sufficient, it would pave the way for a full-blown investigation.Myanmar\u0027s military has been accused of a horrifying list of\u0026nbspviolations, including rape, murder, torture and the burning of Rohingya villages, leading about 700,000 people to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.Ms Bensouda said she will look at reports of “a number of alleged coercive acts having resulted in the forced displacement of the Rohingya people, including deprivation of fundamental rights, killing, sexual violence, enforced disappearance, destruction and looting”.Suu Kyi defends jailing of journalists who covered Rohingya killingsICC rules it can investigate crimes against RohingyaJournalists covering Rohingya crisis jailed for seven years in MyanmarAlthough Myanmar is not a member of the Hague-based court, Bangladesh is.

Iran oil: OPEC says Tehran \u0026lsquoVERY important\u0026rsquo even AFTER US sanctionsMany refiners in Japan, the world\u0027s fourth-biggest oil consumer, say they are also resigned to completely halting imports from one of their historically important suppliers, unlike during a previous round of sanctions when they only reduced imports from Iran.Iran is an important supplier of oil to Japan, accounting for about 5 percent of its crude imports, and Japanese refiners, together with the government, will try to maintain its good relationship with the Middle Eastern country, said Tsukioka, adding that the U.S. sanctions will not cause a major impact.Tsukioka said in July that Japanese oil refiners would likely stop loading Iranian crude oil from mid-September, with final shipments to arrive in the first half of October.And Iran\u0027s Naftiran Intertrade Co Ltd, a trading arm for state-owned National Iranian Oil Co, owns a 15.4 percent stake in Chennai Petroleum, which has two refineries with a total combined capacity of 230,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd).Mr Tsukloka said \u0027each firm is taking the same stance\u0027 on halting Iranian loadings (Image: getty)United India Insurance has informed Chennai Petroleum that its new annual policy that is set to take effect from October will not cover any liability related to processing crude from Iran, the three sources said.\u0026nbspThis has forced the refiner to cancel a scheduled loading of 1 million barrels in October, they said.Indian insurers do not fall directly under the sanctions, but need to hedge their own risk on the Western reinsurance market, which will not accept Iranian exposure.It is quite complicated.. reinsurers are quite apprehensive about extending cover for Chennai Petroleum, said one of the sources, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.                \u0026lsquoSanctions could trigger war,\u0026rsquo Iran issues chilling warning                US sanctions on Iran are \u0027unproductive\u0027 and \u0027wrong\u0027Chennai Petroleum\u0027s reduced demand will further cut India\u0027s imports from Iran to about 10 million tonnes in October, lower than previous estimates reported by Reuters. .Reinsurers have said they can not provide full 100 percent cover. They have agreed to provide support for only 85 percent cover, said a second source, who also declined to be identified.With Chennai\u0027s absence, Iran is left with just two Indian clients, Managalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, and IOC.State-owned refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp has already halted purchases due to insurance problems, while Bharat Petroleum Corp boosted Iranian purchases earlier this year and expects to sharply cut Iranian flows once the sanctions take effect.Nayara Energy is also preparing to halt Iranian imports from November, while Reliance Industries and HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd have already stopped buying Iranian oil.

Heres what you need to know.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remain closely tied to Brussels.It also includes the creation of a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a common rulebook.This rulebook could limit the UKs ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Mrs May has agreed to an amendment that would stop Britain being tied to Europes customs union after we quit the EU.In dramatic scenes in the House of Commons on July 17 2018, Mrs May managed to see off a damaging attempt, winning by just six votes.Mrs May was then defeated on a separate amendment to her flagship Trade Bill, which will require her to seek continued UK participation in the EUs system for regulation of medicines after Brexit.Now her Cabinet is required to ensure that the UK can continue to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency.Mrs May hopes to get an agreement hammered out at a series of summits with EU leaders this autumn, and bring it back to Parliament for approval.A deal on the UKs withdrawal agreement was expected to be agreed in time for the summit in October, along with a statement from both sides on the future relationship.However, a number of senior figures have said this deadline may slide into November.Once a deal has been agreed, MPs will be asked to approve it.In a Panorama interview in September 2018 she said MPs had a simple choice between her Chequers plan or no deal.She told the BBC current affairs programme: I think that the alternative to that [the Chequers plan] will be not having a deal.Opposition to the plan in the Conservative Party centres around the European Research Group of Hard Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.The former Foreign Secretary later claimed Mrs Mays disastrous plans for the Irish border would leave Britain at a loss.Boris Johnson said the European Unions fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was annexed by Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis, Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.The party will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MPNK_EP1_C5_SCREENGRAB_004.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"kim jong un five litres free beer monthly revealed michael palin documentary","story":"These are just some of the singular and strange insights that Monty Python actor Michael Palin gained on his visit to the worlds most secretive state.His experiences form the two-part Channel 5 documentary series, Michael Palin in North Korea, which will air on September 20.In it, he reveals how men in the country are given rations which they can exchange for booze.There are a huge number of bars in Pyongyang to choose from, according to Simon Cockerell, who has been taking Western tour groups to the hermit nation since 2002.He told the Atlantic: I would say the average Pyongyang man would drink beer fairly frequently—at least once a week.Beer culture is something still developing—it is mainly still men going to a bar after work, drinking a couple of beers, and then going home.Palin was woken on his first morning by eerie music booming across the entire city.He described the haunting noise as “the worlds most unusual wake up call” as the same piece of music - called Where Are You Dear General? - was loudly repeated throughout the streets at regular intervals.Other cities you think of screaming sirens but there is none of that at all. This noise, you couldnt avoid it.Speaking at a pre-screening he described the experience of no one recognising him from his travel shows or Monty Python.They didn’t know what a great star meant and basically to them I was a really old bloke and with their reverence for age the minder would rather delightfully would take my arm and say Are you feeling tired?In the second episode, there is a small sequence, and we were stuck in this airport and just to pass the time, our Director Neil, had brought along some footage of Monty Python and showed one minder the fish slapping dance.And her only comment at the end was, “Was that a live fish?”Palins journey begins by boarding a train from Beijing to Pyongyang - North Koreas capital. Not yet under the microscope of their full-time minders, the change in the landscape is remarkable.A shore dominated by Dandongs high-rises faces greenery and scattered buildings across the Yalu River on the North Korean side.Immediately, everything looks dferent, its as  weve stepped back inside, Palin says.His first taste of North Korean hospitality arrives in the form of a series of border guards, all intent on checking and rechecking his documentation.Palin makes it clear early on he is not going to allow an oppressive totalitarian dictatorship quash his famous sense of humour.I was asked - did I have a bible with me? I would normally say yes, absolutely, Im a good Christian man, but no, thats the wrong answer here.The second taste comes during a lunch taken on the 200-mile train journey comes with a side order of Korean propaganda as the television touts images of nuclear weapons.Off the train he meets his two guides - who turn out to actually number eight.He finds himself in a city missing many staples of the west - there are very few cars, and absolutely no adverts save for party propaganda.State controlled newspapers are covered with news of the historic meeting between north and south which were occurring at the time, and Plain says he sensed a eagerness for more openness among the populace.Palin points out how, until recently, the city would have been a soulless landscape of grey Soviet-style apartment blocks.In a simple and effective solution, Kim Jong-il commanded the whole lot was painted bright colours.Palin provides no shortage of humour titbits, including one point when he finds himself mystied watching the robotic movements of the traffic controllers - all of whom, he notes, are young women.Theres rumour that Kim Jong-un picks them himself, he says.He visits a local school and marvels at the childrens ping pong skills.Its like a factory farm for ping pong players, he says.Viewers can also look forward to the drunken antics of May Day - an annual day off for North Koreans.The celebrations allow a powerful insight into what Palin says are normal people, living in an unusual place."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433053835.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"plans dump chequers brexit proposal","story":"The Sun can reveal that work is underway to “pivot” away from the softer Brexit plan to allow the PM to escape a political disaster.The Tory party meets for its annual conference just 10 days after a crucial EU summit in the Austrian town of Salzburg next Wednesday.The gathering is swtly turning into a make or break moment for Mrs May’s premiership.Allies fear she will face huge pressure to resign  she is forced to go in front of the Tory faithful with her Chequers plan in pieces.Two dferent escape options are being looked at.Under the first, Chequers will be parked until talks resume after Brexit day for a loosely-worded fudge on the future relationship instead.The second option is to abandon it altogether and  to a more basic Canada style free trade agreement - but only  the EU gives way on its Irish border hardline.One Cabinet minister told The Sun: “Plan A is the EU27 show enough leg to keep Chequers alive, at least until after conference.“That’s far from clear yet, so we need a Plan B.That is,  you’re in a cul de sac the best way to get out of it is fast.”The senior minister added: “The Prime Minister will not be left stranded, so work is under way to ensure she can pivot away from Chequers quickly  she needs to after Salzburg”.The 27 EU leaders are expected to boost Mrs May with warm words in Salzburg about the Brexit orce deal and future security partnership.But No10 aides fear they may well still give her the thumbs down on Chequers’ two key planks - the Future Customs Arrangement and single market access for good only.Cabinet minister allies are also unsure Mrs May can survive a third major change of plan on Brexit.One added: “Has the PM got the dexterity to pull off a pivot?Quite frankly, that’s not clear to me”.It has also emerged that the PM’s chief spin doctor told Brexiteers that the Chequers plan could yet change substantially during a dinner in No10 on Monday night.Wining and dining senior critics of the soft Brexit plan, Downing Street comms boss Robbie Gibb pleaded with nine Tory MPs to get behind Mrs May, hinting sweeping changes to the plans are coming.Over salmon, asparagus soup and white wine in the PM’s wood panelled dining room, MPs claim Mr Gibb told them not to “die in a ditch” as the final deal could look very dferent as it is still “subject to negotiations”.However allies of Mr Gibb present dispute the account.But the charm offensive backfired after Brexiteer ringleader Bernard Jenkin “lost his temper” and lashed out that the Chequers model would never work.Fellow Tory Daniel Kawczynski hit out at Mrs May’s stance that a soft Brexit was needed because of Northern Ireland, pointing to the Poland’s border with Belarus to show smuggling can be countered.And Mr Gibb’s warning there could be a second referendum  Chequers collapsed was “noisily dismissed by the whole room”, who pointed out that the PM would have to table such a vote herself and has already ruled it out.Last night eurocrats warned that expectations on the UK side of an imminent breakthrough in the talks had been overinflated.A senior EU official told The Sun: “There’s a lot of overspin about changing the mandate.The mood music here is we aren’t going to do that.“The Brits shouldn’t have illusions.The spin that Barnier will be sidelined and it’ll be much easier to make a dferent deal with the leaders, that’s not how the process works.“There’s a lot of overspin these days on the UK side and we have to be very cautious with all that because the disappointment will be rather big.”The official also said that British hopes a summit of EU leaders in Salzburg will change the course of the talks are misplaced.They said: “People shouldn’t expect that Salzburg will suddenly dramatically change our position or the course of the negotiations.”However, the PM was handed a rare boost by Hungarian leader Viktor Orban who said his country wants to see Britain handed a generous trade deal.He said: “We would like to have a fair Brexit because we love the British and we cooperated always well.You deserve a good deal, a fair deal.”The PM told a meeting of her Cabinet that Salzburg will be “a staging post” towards a Brexit deal.He added: “The PM said she expected EU leaders to take stock of the progress made in the negotiations on both the withdrawal and future relationship.“It will also be the first time leaders will discuss together the UK’s white paper, which put forward a series of credible and serious proposals.”Meanwhile Brexiteers stepped up their attack on the PMs plans - telling her chief of staff at a dinner in No10 that she must chuck her Chequers blueprint or face a leadership contest.One MP warned chief of staff Gavin Barwell that a leadership contest was almost certainly to be triggered as early as next month  she stuck to her current plan.Mr Barwell promised them hed give the PM a full appraisal of their views.At a separate meeting of the influential backbench European Research Group hardened their opposition to the PM.A Tory MP in the meeting said everyone in the room agreed Mrs Mays time was up.The MP told itv news: Everyone I know says she has to go, shes a disaster, this cant go on.The group of about 50 backbench Tory MPs even war-gamed a leadership contest, the MP said.The number at the ERG meeting is signicant given only 48 Tory MPs are needed to trigger a no confidence vote in the leader.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is no legal obligation to pay anything at all.This has been established by the House of Lords and no credible authority has questioned their Lordships.If we pay £40billon we must get something clear in , not just wishy-washy promises.Taxpayers would be outraged  it were otherwise.Any agreement on immigration must be examined with great care.We will doubtless be told that free movement has ended but, as Shakespeare wrote, “what’s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”.There ought to be no preferential terms for new arrivals from the EU above those offered to other nations and no access to state benefits.There must be a clear dferentiation in their rights after we have left and admission must be subject to a work permit scheme focused on skilled rather than unskilled labour.The solution to the Irish question is a further area where Brexiteers must be alert. Last week the European Research Group, which I chair, produced a paper explaining how it could be answered on the EU’s terms.Obviously the UK could simply say that there will be no physical infrastructure at the border but  instead we examine what the EU does on its other borders, and see  those precedents could be followed, then no reasonable person would think a “hard” border were necessary.So far the inevitable attacks on our reports have been mere rudery. No one has found fault with facts.If Ireland were used to justy the major concessions the Government is giving then we would know the deal is a bad one based on a false premise.It would be better than any other which the EU has so far agreed but Ireland is supposed to make it impossible.The issue has been used by those who are fearful of leaving the EU to keep us bound by its rules and regulations.Inevitably these complex machinations have led to some gossip about the leadership.These stories come from all wings of the Party with pro-Europeans such as Tom Tugendhat and George Freeman suggesting it is time to move to a new generationHowever, it is worth remembering the Prime Minister’s virtues.She is determined, thorough and dutul, and in my view duty is an heroic virtue.This gives her great strength and without a clear Parliamentary majority it is not obvious that anyone else could steer the negations to a conclusion.Pitt the Younger was hailed as the pilot who weathered the storm.

Nobody wants it.But this self-described “bloody dficult woman” believes she alone can ram it through.Either she knows something nobody else does . . . or her fabled “polished turd” is about to hit the fan.On tonight’s BBC’s Panorama, Mrs May spells out the formula she thinks propelled her to the top: “You bide your time and you are bloody dficult when it really matters.”Others fear a dferent characteristic has defined her political career, especially as Home Secretary.“She is mulishly stubborn,” says a former ally.“Once she digs her heels in, nothing can sht her — right or wrong.”They fear she will stick defiantly to her half-baked plan until she runs out of road and is forced to choose between an EU fudge or defeat in the House of Commons.The Chequers deal is flawed by the fantasy we can follow an EU rule book on free trade and regulation while reserving the right to duck and e.Outside Cabinet, Tories on all sides — Brexiteers and Remainers — insist it is unworkable.“It fails to take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade,” writes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.“We would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe.”EU negotiator Michel Barnier fears it endangers the whole EU project, which is already threatened by tensions over mass immigration, the Euro and jobless school leavers.Special treatment for the UK would instantly trigger demands from other member states for their own tailor-made deals, unravelling the drive for ever-closer union.Mrs May claims there is no alternative to Chequers.But there has to be — and Britain is already working on it.Despite Chancellor Phil Hammond’s blundering interference, preparations for a clean break are in train, covering everything from free trade to the vexed border with Northern Ireland.It may be pitched as a last-ditch option, only to be deployed in an emergency.But since Chequers is universally seen as a non-starter, free trade automatically becomes the only viable plan on the UK table.New Brexit minister, karate black belt and rising star Dominic Raab, is making this vividly clear in Brussels.He alarmed Downing Street by threatening to withhold the EU’s £40billion ransom  they push us too far.And he has told Barnier to do his own dirty work and impose a border in the Irish Sea  he dares.This is music to the ears of Tory MPs who desperately yearn to see some fighting spirit.They hope against hope Mrs May secretly has a cunning plan, ready to roll out at the right moment as she suggests, calling Barnier’s bluff.But there is another red card on the table, face up and flashing danger to our EU neighbours.Do they want to humiliate the PM to the point where she is defeated in Parliament and pushed into a second catastrophic election?EU leaders can read the polls which put Labour in front.They will also be horried to see ex-Tory vice-chairman Jeffrey Archer unhelpfully saying he would vote for Corbyn  he were a Northerner.And we should all be alarmed by David Cameron’s Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury minister, Jim O’Neill, saying: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government.”The EC has enough on its plate with the growing explosion of anti-Brussels populism across Europe. The last thing it wants any time soon is a hard-left Labour government led by lelong EU-haters Jeremy Corbyn and Marxist Chancellor John McDonnell.It might be the one bargaining chip that makes Michel Barnier blink first.For a Bank of England governor, his forecast of a 35 per cent crash in house prices verged on the hysterical.Project Fear has lost the power to shock, but it won’t stop trying.Aircraft will not fall from the sky, the Channel Tunnel will stay open, NHS patients will not starve or die from lack of NHS drugs.Not only have Carney’s nightmare scenarios of slump and mass unemployment proved false, the reverse has happened.Young workers are flocking to the UK for jobs. Wages are rising. Growth is strong.Now we see French companies such as Chanel stampeding to invest billions here.

And the influx continues.Latest statistics show the number of migrants who settled here in the year to March 2018 was 614,000, equal to a city bigger than Bristol. Net migration was around 270,000.Yet the revolution has been imposed by the ruling elite without any consent. No British citizen was ever asked to vote for this upheaval. No major party ever sought a mandate to open our doors.This helps to explain why the British public has such profound distrust in MPs on the question of immigration, as revealed in a major new opinion survey published this week.In the biggest consultation of its kind, involving 20,000 interviews, just one in six people showed any faith in the Government to tackle migration, while only 13 per cent felt that politicians are “open and honest” about the issue.These findings are not the result of bigotry or prejudice. Britons have been remarkably tolerant in the face of change.Indeed, that shines through the survey, which discovered that 65 per cent of people believe migrants bring valuable skills to the economy and the public sector. Similarly, 59 per cent think that ersity benefits our national culture.But British decency has been exploited by the political class to implement its agenda, with the result that disillusion is now widespread.People are rightly fed up with politicians who indulge in denial and deceit about the reality of mass immigration.A classic example was the phoney claim from the last Labour Government that, when the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004, just 13,000 of their citizens would come to the UK. In fact, more than a million did.Even worse has been the attempt, particularly by the Left, to suppress open discussion by hurling accusations of racism against critics of mass immigration.A climate of censorship now prevails where public figures are expected to parrot the fashionable orthodoxy, and ordinary citizens are afraid to voice their concerns.Yet the anxieties of the public are all too genuine. Immigration has imposed more strain on our civic infrastructure, reflected in the shortage of affordable housing, the never-ending NHS crisis, the growth in the welfare burden and dficulties for parents in finding school places for kids.The import of cheap foreign labour has meant lower wages and job insecurity. Just as disturbing is the erosion of solidarity because of this upheaval.Social cohesion cannot exist without real integration, as the public recognised in the survey.The majority of respondents, 88 per cent, agreed with the idea that “migrants should learn English” and 85 per cent believe that migrants “should share our values”.But the multicultural ideology, which has long been the creed of the state, works in the opposite direction.It encourages migrants to cling to the practices and languages of their native lands, fuelling ision. As does the institutionalised acceptance of sharia law, which arguably offers more protection to men than women, undermining the traditional concept that we are all equal before the law.The consequences of multi-culturalism are seen at their most corrosive in the failure by the state to tackle serious crimes perpetrated by ethnic minorities, such as the organised abuse of girls by mainly Asian gangs in places like Rotherham and Derby.More concerned to uphold the illusion of cultural ersity’s success than to protect victims of crime, the police and other authorities indulged in a cover-up. It was only exposure of the abuse by journalists that finally forced them to act.That mix of official dishonesty and paralysis only undermines our society. There is a lesson for us from Europe, where the political order is threatened by growing public anger over immigration.In 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that “this multi-cultural approach has failed.” But she did nothing to reverse the policy. Instead, she opened the door even wider, especially in 2015 when she allowed in more than a million migrants.The crime that followed has led to public outcry.Britain has always been renowned for its avoidance of extremism. But we will avoid the same fate only  the state adopts a new approach on immigration, including more political honesty, tighter border controls and an emphasis on British values.That is not racist. As the public knows, it is a recipe for greater harmony.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a “fantasy island unicorn model”.Triumphant Remoaners piled in. It proved Brexiteers were clueless, they chirped. And Downing Street then ­produced its convoluted alternative.Except the EU, in the form of Michel Barnier, now believes in the fantasy island unicorn model too.

Nor should they, since it ides the UK.Funny though, isn’t it, how Brussels move the goalposts when it suits them? They have negotiated in bad faith all along.TOO many politicians are in denial about the soaring cost of the NHS and social care. So we applaud Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s imaginative plan to sort the latter.The new lelong insurance system he is considering, compulsory for all workers unless they take a risk and opt out, looks a practical idea to fund part or all of an OAP’s care costs.It would give them peace of mind that they wouldn’t have to spend their savings or the proceeds from their home.Maybe it will work. Maybe not. Regardless, it is to Mr Hancock’s credit that he is starting a grown-up conversation at last over future funding of health.For too long progress has been stymied by the Left using any change to the NHS as a political weapon.But the structure of a health service designed in 1948 now needs a radical rethink.It is time reality dawned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She highlighted that free trade agreements often treat goods and services dferently, and that Chequers proposes a governance structure to make sure the future relationship continues to works for both the UK and EU.“The Prime Minister and Manfred Weber agreed on the importance of citizens’ rights and the Prime Minister welcomed the work of the European Parliament on this issue.

And they’re right to be.As recently as 1991, a third of those aged 16 to 24 owned their own home.Now, that figure is ten per cent.For those aged 25 to 34, the rate has fallen from 66 per cent to 38 per cent.Home ownership rates in Britain are now the fourth lowest in the EU, and we have the second highest proportion of social housing, i.e., people living in homes provided by the State.Earlier this year, we at the Centre for Policy Studies commissioned polling asking young people how government could make their lives better.The top answer was clear — they want housing to be more affordable.And not via cheaper rents — by a three-to-one margin, they wanted the Government to prioritise home ownership.Strikingly, only three per cent of those aged 18 to 24 told us they never wanted to own their own home.They just can’t see themselves being able to afford it for years — often decades.This is a crisis with many causes.The persistent failure, stretching back decades, to build enough new homes. A dysal planning system.Existing homeowners who don’t want their communities disrupted or their views spoiled.A Labour government that made it much easier for buy-to-let landlords to snap up those homes that were being built, and much harder for first-time buyers to do the same — and a financial crash which made that problem so much worse. Yet it’s also a crisis with many solutions.Making it easier to extend or expand existing properties. Changing Green Belt regulations so we protect our most beautul countryside while building on pig farms, or beside railway stations or motorways or electricity substations or other decidedly non-green and unpleasant bits of land.Finding ways  to turn renters into owners, as Margaret Thatcher did with the Right to Buy for council tenants in the 1980s, with more than a little success.But the sad truth is that while the Government has succeeded in dragging up construction levels, it is still not thinking anywhere near radically enough.“Since my very first day in Downing Street, I have made it my personal mission to fix our broken housing system,” Theresa May told the National Housing Federation yesterday.But that mission is in grave jeopardy.A year ago, the Prime Minister endured a triple whammy of embarrassment in her party conference speech — being handed a P45 by a prankster, developing a crippling cough, then seeing the slogan behind her start to fall off.Mrs May bravely endured these trials. But she could do little about the fact that her promise in the same speech to “make the British dream a reality by igniting home ownership once again” was built around a £10billion expansion of the Help to Buy scheme.A scheme which pretty much every economist, including the Government’s own Office for Budget Responsibility, says is mostly serving to push up house prices and make colossally rich housebuilders even richer.Indeed, even as Mrs May was speaking, their collective share price spiked by £1BILLION.Yesterday, the Prime Minister ed to the subject.In a speech to the National Housing Summit, she promised another £2billion for social housing.But even on its own terms, Mrs May’s proposal isn’t a blunderbuss.It’s a pinprick. Not only is the £2billion spread over a decade but it’s a small fraction of the amount that George Osborne cut from the same budgets.And it fits a wider pattern. For all the Government’s rhetoric, the big ideas to get Britain building just aren’t there.One of the keys to David Cameron’s election victory in 2015 — right there on the first page of the Tory manesto — was a promise to extend the Right to Buy to housing associations and to build 200,000 starter homes.The commitment was to create two million more homeowners within five years.As of May 2018, not a single one of those starter homes had been built — and the expansion of Right to Buy is still lodged in the gullet of the Whitehall machine.It’s the same pattern on planning reform.Sajid Javid’s robust proposals as Communities Secretary to break up the oligopoly of the big housebuilders, free up more land and speed up development — all badly needed — were neutered by Downing Street, because it was paranoid about upsetting traditional Tory voters who don’t like the sight of bulldozers.When the Government’s new planning framework was announced in March, the headlines were about building more and higher-quality homes.But the small print made it so that councils could get away with building fewer houses, not more.I don’t doubt that Mrs May’s heart is in the right place.But  she and her team don’t pluck up their courage on housing — and take far more dramatic steps both to build more houses and create more homeowners — they’ll almost certainly lose the next election. More than that, they’ll deserve to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vexed issue. Complain about it and people will call you a racist.That’s a popular way of shutting down debate these days. Just screech “raaacisst” at someone.I’d go so far as to say it’s one of the reasons Leave won the referendum — because ordinary people were sick of being called racist when they simply worried about the millions of people who have arrived here in the past ten years.About seven million, in fact. An astonishing number.The Prime Minister is about to draw up her plans for immigration post-Brexit.She will be taking advice from the Migration Advisory Committee . It has suggested we allow in skilled workers who might be vital to our economy.It has also suggested we clamp down on low-skilled migrants.This seems to me a perfectly sensible argument. We should not entirely close ourselves off from the world. And there are foreign nationals here who do excellent work for our country. And pay good taxes.At the same time, the vast influx of low-skilled workers has had a terrible effect upon our country.Some towns — such as Boston in Lincolnshire — have been effectively taken over.And as the MAC found, the vast reservoir of labour has depressed the wages of British people at the lowest end of the scale. It has hurt the poorest of us.But it doesn’t only hurt us. You’ll have seen the squalid conditions in which a lot of these low-paid foreign workers live. This is exploitation, on a massive scale.How any leftie can support it absolutely befoggles me.Living below the minimum wage, crammed into rotten accommodation — all so companies such as Amazon can make a bigger profit.No wonder the big companies were the first to complain. Listen: Pay your workers a decent, living wage in future and shut up, huh?But this is an overcrowded country. It is ludicrous to suggest that the millions we have allowed in have not had a massive effect on our infrastructure.It’s why we need to pave over more and more of the countryside to build homes, for example. The MAC suggested house prices had risen as a consequence — and our homes already cost too much.There’s pressure on our schools, our hospitals and our transport networks.Well, with any luck this will all come to an end. Perhaps the Government might also abide by its pledge to get yearly immigration levels down to the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands as it is at the moment.But at the same time we should look after the EU migrants we have already let in, and ensure they feel secure and safe living in Britain.Do all that and I’ll be a happy man.

They are urging you to get yours serviced and to install audible carbon monoxide monitors in your home.It might just save a le.Schoolgirl Katie Overton went to bed excited about her little sister’s birthday party next day — but tragically the family never got to celebrate.The next morning, the 11-year-old was found dead in her bed, having been poisoned by carbon monoxide which had leaked from a faulty boiler at her home.Stepdad Paul recalls: “We’d been busy getting ready for Emma’s fth birthday party. We’d been baking cakes and blowing up balloons.“We went to bed as normal that night. In the morning we all got up and cracked on with the arrangements and we thought Katie was having a lie-in.“The house seemed very quiet. I popped out and when I came home, Katie still wasn’t up.“We were used to her having a lie-in at the weekend, but we felt something was wrong.”Mum Debra, 47, went up to Katie’s bedroom at the family’s rented terraced house in Southsea, Hants.Paul, 53, recalls: “Debs called out to me that she’d been sick in her bed. I ran upstairs and she was lying there, motionless.“I started shaking her, trying to rouse her. She wasn’t responding. Her body was cold.“I told Debs to call 999 and I spoke to paramedics on the phone. They told me to try mouth-to-mouth, but her jaw was locked. I knew then she was dead.“We had no idea why or what had happened. All of us were in a state of shock.”An ambulance rushed Katie to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, but within half an hour a doctor confirmed the family’s worst fears.Paul says: “He said there was nothing they could do for her. There was no obvious cause of death.“All we could think was that she’d been sick in her sleep and choked on it.“Because it was an unexplained death, we had CID come to the house. They asked us all sorts of questions, whether Katie had been having any problems at school.“They took away the mattress as evidence and the four of us were left in the house, with no idea the gas was still leaking.”To make matters even worse, rumours circulated around the area that Paul and Debra had murdered their daughter.Paul says: “A friend of Debra’s told us there were some lies going around. There was a lot of stares and whispering behind our backs.“It was incredibly hard to deal with, as we were grieving for Katie.“We were in a state of shock. She was a perfectly healthy girl and she seemed fine when she went to bed the night before.”Post-mortems do not routinely check for carbon monoxide poisoning, so no cause of death was given to her family.But around ten days later, Debra woke Paul early one morning complaining of a strong smell of fumes.He recalls: “I had a splitting headache and the house stank. I felt dizzy and sick.“I phoned our letting agent and said we thought something was seriously wrong with the boiler. An engineer came out and said he was going to put a carbon monoxide monitor by the boiler and we all had to leave the house. He left it running for ten minutes before going back in to grab it. He ran back out again and said, ‘I can’t believe any of you are alive.’“There was a lethal amount of carbon monoxide in the house. He kept saying he was surprised we were still alive.“I asked him  he thought it might have caused Katie’s death and he said, ‘Possibly’.” Paul phoned the police and even though Katie’s body had been cremated, they still had some blood samples. They later tested positive for carbon monoxide.An investigation revealed that faulty pipework on the boiler had been allowing the toxic gas to escape into Katie’s bedroom. Paul has been campaigning for tighter regulations to prevent deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning ever since Katie’s death in March 2003.She says: “He seemed very poorly. He didn’t have a temperature but he kept falling asleep and he’d vomit.“Then, I’d find him asleep in the dining room in a really strange position. Something just didn’t feel right.”The same morning, the carbon monoxide alarm at her home in Strood, Kent, started beeping. She says: “It wasn’t the continuous warning alarm but it was beeping as  it had run out of batteries.“I guess it just made me think and I had a niggling feeling it might be something to do with carbon monoxide. I rushed Aaden-James to A\u0026ampE. They took a blood sample and within five minutes he was on oxygen. He had to spend a couple of days in hospital.“Fortunately, he is OK and there are no lasting effects.”Tests later revealed the gas was leaking from pipes at the top of the boiler.Kirstein says: “If you don’t have a carbon monoxide alarm, get one now. I had one before, now I have three.”But latest figures show there are still around 50 fatalities a year in the UK.He says: “Fteen years on and the basic laws haven’t changed and people are still dying.“Katie’s death was preventable. We didn’t have a carbon monoxide alarm in the house.“We are all now living with a sadness that will never go away.”Paul adds that the tragedy has been particularly hard on Katie’s sisters, Sian, now 22, and Emma, 21.He says: “We want to make people aware of the dangers of carbon monoxide so no more families lose someone like we have.“Sometimes people will say to me, ‘It’s OK, I haven’t got gas, I’ve got a wood-burning stove.’“But carbon monoxide is produced by all solid fuels that burn. There are more carbon monoxide alarms around now than when Katie died, but in England, the law says they only have to be in properties that burn solid fuel.THE Sun is offering you the chance to win one of five brand new Ariston boilers worth more than £1,000 each.The Ariston Clas Net ONE comes with an industry-leading 12-year warranty.To be in with a chance of winning see thesun/aristoncompetition and answer two simple questions.“In Scotland, they have to be in all properties. The law in England needs changing — everyone should have one.“What about older properties? They often don’t have alarms. And what about your neighbour? We lived in a terraced house — the people next door may well have been poisoned as well.“Carbon monoxide goes straight through the brickwork. Please make sure you install an audible alarm in your home. If we’d had one, we would have been alerted to the gas and our beautul Katie would still be with us.”Paul also warns that gas safety ­certicates are not a substitute for ­having appliances regularly serviced.He says: “You can get a certicate without having a service. Of course, a lot of people choose this asSue, 45, had moved into a new-build home in Sale, Grt Manchester, with son Josh and now ex-husband Paul in 2003.She says: “I worked at home running a building firm. I’d get headaches and be queasy, dizzy and fatigued. I put it down to stress. I was forgetful, but thought I was getting dementia. Josh was six. He’d get stomach and head pains.Three years later, Sue was admitted to hospital TWICE with chest pain – and once collapsed – but each time doctors misdiagnosed cocaine abuse, let her rest then discharged her.“No one mentioned carbon monoxide and I wasn’t tested,” she says. But the warranty on her boiler then expired and Paul called an engineer, who found the leaky flue under the lounge floor.Sue still suffers memory, migraine and rheumatic trouble while Josh has poor concentration, and she thinks her family only survived because Paul would open windows a lot. She warns: “With smoke you get a warning but with CO there is no taste or smell. It is a silent killer.”“But what it means is that all these years after Katie’s death, an engineer can walk into a house, have a look at the flame and say, ‘Yes it’s burning a nice blue and it is safe.’“It gives you a false confidence. All gas appliances need to be serviced as per the manufacturers’ guidelines.“And get it done now, don’t wait until November when engineers are busy.

The electorate has clearly spoken.I would like to thank my true friends, family, the electorate who have stood by me with unwavering support.

He should demonstrate some humility.Mr Paisleys Commons ban has left Theresa May shorn of one of her 10 DUP MP confidence and supply allies during a period that could witness several crucial Brexit votes.An investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found the cost of the hospitality afforded Mr Paisley and his family may have been signicantly more than his £50,000 estimate.It found the Sri Lankan holidays included business-class air travel, accommodation at first-class hotels, helicopter trips and visits to tourist attractions for the North Antrim MP and his wider family.The trips also included meeting with Sri Lankan governmental figures.Mr Paisleys threshold for registering such hospitality in 2013 was around £660."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000435418058.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=600\" height=\"960","title":"van driver soaks schoolboy driving through puddle storm ali","story":"The clip - filmed yesterday as deadly Storm Ali caused chaos in the UK - was posted on Twitter with the caption: Get back to class ya wet wipe.”It shows the driver pulling out at a junction before driving straight towards a large brown puddle at the side of the road.He then speeds up after seeing three young boys with backpacks on just inches from the puddle.One, who appears to be aged around 15, can be seen trying to shield himself as the water completely drenches him.The Ford driver then laughs before the video - believed to be filmed in Edinburgh - cuts out.The clip was uploaded by @pammy_caton to Twitter yesterday afternoon where it has since attracted over 162,000 views.The 22-year-old electrician has since received dozens of messages trolling him - although at no point does he admit being behind the wheel.One Twitter user, @staceyjaxx451, wrote: “Thats real clever…”@stevieberwick said: “What a c***y thing to do.

I don’t like that approach at all. What we need is a fair Brexit and good cooperation between UK and EU in future.Jean Claude Juncker appeared to be on the fence, telling reporters that Mrs Mays 10-minute speech at dinner was polite, it was not aggressive, she was doing her job.This morning Mrs May had meetings with other leaders - including Angela Merkel and a series of other leaders.Mr Tusk this morning posted a sassy snap on his Instagram of him offering the PM a bit of cake, with the caption: A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries.TWO EU leaders have spoken out and demanded Brits change their minds and reverse Brexit today.Ahead of Theresa Mays crunch summit in Salzburg, the PMs of Malta and the Czech Republic took the unusual step of calling for a fresh referendum on leaving the EU.Ignoring the clear will of the 17million Brits who opted to break free of the bloc in 2016, Andrej Babiš, the eurosceptic Czech prime minister, told the BBC he was “very unhappy that the UK is leaving and maybe it would be better to make another referendum”.And Joseph Muscat, the Maltese PM, said most of the other EU leaders agreed, and wanted to make the almost impossible happen.I think most of us would welcome a situation where there is the possibility of the British people, putting things into perspective, and then deciding once and for all, he added.But last night the PM told EU leaders there was not going to be another vote.Brussels wants an operational backstop in place to prevent a so-called hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit.But that would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EUs single market and customs union.Theresa May simply wont accept this because it will effectively break up the UK and put a virtual border in the Irish sea.And it will infuriate her coalition partners, the DUP, too, who she relies on to win votes in the House of Commons.A new plan by Mr Barnier – revealed by The Sun on Saturday – to police the new customs border between Britain and Northern Ireland with invisible technology has also been thrown out by No10.Britain wants an agreement to not be needed, by agreeing a close partnership with the EU which would make the backstop void.EX-Brexit Secretary David Davis has taken apart Theresa Mays Chequers proposals - on the same day the EU met to discuss them.Mr Davis, who quit over Mrs Mays blueprint for our EU exit, tore them to shreds in a speech today.He told an audience: Chequers is devoid of democracy altogether.Telling Brits they must seize this historic opportunity, he argued that Chequers destroyed all the manesto promises Mrs May had made on taking back control of our money, borders and laws.And he lashed out over plans to keep us tied to the EU forever by accepting a common rulebook.We cannot be governed by a body that we have no control over. It should not even be contemplated, he added.Mr Davis, who is bringing forward an alternative Free Trade Agreement plan in the coming weeks, said Chequers was unpopular among the public too.And on the tricky issue of the Northern Ireland border - which is a huge sticking point in the talks - he insisted there would not be a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland after we leave - because EU politicians have said they wont put one up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The situation is the running sore of US foreign policy.”The Labour boss, who was a backbencher at the time, appeared at the conference which also listed as a speaker preacher Daud Abdullah, who led a boycott of Holocaust Memorial Day.In response Gideon Falter, chairman of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, said: “Jeremy Corbyns obsession with Israel blinds him.“He has called for a boycott of his own football club, not because of its close association with the Emirates – which engages in torture and execution – but because of some obscure connection to Israel.”Mr Corbyn, who has often spoken of his love for Arsenal, appeared in a “show racism the red card” video at the club’s ground.But it was mired in controversy after it was revealed the YouTube star interviewing him, David Vujanic, sent tweets containing the N-word and joked about Jews and Hitler.A Labour spokesman responded to MailOnline saying: “Jeremy has never boycotted an Arsenal game.“He does support targeted action aimed at illegal settlements and the occupation of Palestinian territories, and has backed campaigns to bring it to an end.Arsenal football club declined to comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maria Chatzaki, professor of molecular biology and genetics at Democritus University of Thrace, Greece said heatwaves, sufficient humidity and food paved the way for the booming population.The name Tetragnatha is derived from Greek, tetra — a numerical prefix referring to four and gnatha meaning jaw.They are found all over the world although most thrive in warmer climates in the tropics and subtropics.Commony, they are called stretch spiders because of their eerier elongated body form.When disturbed they will stretch their front legs forward — while they jut their other six legs backwards.This allows them to hide on blades of grass or similar elongated pieces of foliage like twigs and leaves.One of the biggest and most common species is T. extensa.It can be found near lakes, river banks or swamps.Large numbers of iniduals can often be found in reeds, tall grass or minor trees and shrubs.They are so light and nimble that they are able to run over water and chose the waters edge as their preferred habitat.Ms Chatzaki told Newsit.gr: Its as  the spiders are taking advantage of these conditions and are having a kind of a party. “They mate, they reproduce and provide a whole new generation.These spiders are not dangerous for humans and will not cause any damage to the areas flora.The spiders will have their party and will soon die."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000435487011.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle grenfell community kitchen with mum doria ragland prince harry","story":"The Duchess of Sussex, 37, beamed as she described the multicultural capital while launching a cookbook written by neighbours of Grenfell Tower disaster victims.Ms Ragland, 62, was heard introducing herself as Megs mom to members of the group.There have been rumours Meghans mum has been looking to move to the UK to be closer to her daughter in recent weeks.Meghan called the book a tremendous labour of love in a speech to volunteers from the kitchen and paid tribute to their community spirit.As Harry and her mother watched on with pride, she described first going to visit the kitchen in January and being overcome by the welcome from the group.\" data-credit=\"AFP or licensors\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-img=\"https:www.thesun/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000435488889.jpg?strip=all\u0026ampw=960\" height=\"3444\" width=\"5166\"/AFP or licensors15Prince Harry looked on with love as he joined Meghan and Ms Ragland in meeting volunteers from the kitchen\" data-credit=\"AFP or licensors\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-img=\"https:www.thesun/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000435494224-e1537454937657.jpg?strip=all\u0026ampw=960\" height=\"3104\" width=\"4273\"/AFP or licensors15 Meghan, Harry and Doria Ragland posed with members of the groupShe said: I had just recently moved to London and I felt so immediately embraced by the women in the kitchen and their warmth and their kindness.On a personal level, I feel so proud to live in a city with so much ersity.

The French president, who has taken a hard stance on preserving the European Union\u0027s united front in talks on Britain\u0027s departure from the bloc, said Brexit showed other countries that leaving the EU had negative consequences.  It was a good and brave step by the prime minister, Macron told reporters. But we all agreed on this today, the proposals in their current state are not acceptable, especially on the economic side of it, he said. The Chequers plan cannot be take it or leave it, he added.  Those who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be alright, and that it\u0027s going to bring a lot of money home are liars, Macron said. It\u0027s even more true since they left the day after so as not to have to deal with it, he said, referring to top Brexit proponents.  He said the remaining states would never accept a deal which would damage the EU and its integrity. It comes as European Council president Donald Tusk said the leaders of the remaining 27 EU states agreed the Chequers blueprint for Brexit will not work in its present form. At the end of the two-day informal summit in Salszburg, Mr Tusk said they would decide in October whether there had been sufficient progress in the Brexit talks to call a special summit in November to finalise a deal.  Everybody shared the view that while there are positive elements in the Chequers proposal, the suggested framework for economic co-operation will not work, not least because it is undermining the single market, he said.

But you\u0027ll need to have a few million pounds lying around. An impressive tower in the New Forest, built in 1886, is up for sale for a handsome \u0026pound3.5million. The Sway Tower, named for its proximity to the village of Sway in Hampshire - and not because of any architectural concerns - reaches a height of 220 feet, spanning 14 floors. It boasts beautul, panoramic views across the New Forest National Park to the Isle of Wight.  While the tower\u0027s cupola and its spiral staircase might look like something from a medieval castle, it\u0027s actually very homely on the inside and was previously a boutique hotel. On the ground floor is a sitting room, drawing room, dining room, kitchen and conservatory. There\u0027s also an indoor swimming pool, tennis court and garage set within a walled garden measuring three quarters of an acre.  Between the first and fourth storeys are four en-suite double bedrooms, each on their own floor. Above this, between floors five and 13, are seven more rooms. Four of them are listed as suitable for conversion into, say, four further double bedrooms . One of the remaining rooms is purely for water storage, while the other three are used by two mobile operators and the emergency services.  While this may sound like an inconvenience, it actually brings in rental income of around \u0026pound35k per year. On top of the tower is the cupola giving breathtaking views across the countryside -  you\u0027re fit enough to get up that many stairs.

Kiesha Schofield was assaulted by 28-year-old Jade Binch last year after she reportedly fell out with the mum\u0027s daughter, who was a school pal.  She was left with a fractured nose, bruising and a bloodshot eye following the attack, according to her own mother, Tfany Schofield. Tfany, 33, says she reassured Kiesha that Binch would be jailed for the beating, which also allegedly left the youngster with scratches all over her body. But instead, she escaped jail with a fine and a six-month community order.  The attacker, who had been convicted of assault by beating last September, was also given 10 days of rehabilitation activities and told to pay court costs. Now, Kiesha is reportedly too scared to walk to school after repeatedly encountering Binch in the street since the conviction a year ago. Her mum claims Binch \u0027got away with\u0027 the attack. Sharing images of her bloodied daughter, Tfany, from Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, said: You can see the state Kiesha was in from the pictures. She had blood all over her face and was bruised on her head and body. She claimed Binch fractured Kiesha\u0027s nose and left her with scratches over her body and bruises on her back and arms where she had been kicked. She had a bruised and blood shot eye which took a long time to heal, she said.  However, Binch claimed that the injuries obtained by the young girl were not linked to the incident and that Tfany\u0027s claims were not true. The Crown Prosecution Service  confirmed the images showing Kiesha with a bloodied face, damaged nose and bruising were used as evidence in the case. Tfany continued: I was livid. I wanted to do the same to her that she\u0027d done to Kiesha but common sense kicked in. I knew I needed to show Kiesha that you follow the right processes. I knew I couldn\u0027t retaliate. I kept reassuring her: \u0027She\u0027ll definitely get prison time for this\u0027. When she was given the fine and no jail sentence, I couldn\u0027t believe it. The judge who also watched the CCTV footage in court gave her a fine - how is that justice for attacking a minor? An online video appears to show Binch training in a boxing ring three years ago. The man who shared the footage claimed to have trained her for four years. Many commenters praised her \u0027hook\u0027, while Binch bragged that she was a \u0027wolf not a sheep\u0027.  Kiesha and Binch\u0027s daughter had been playing in a group in March 2017 when they reportedly fell out. According to Tfany, Binch then approached the schoolgirl after being alerted to the row by her daughter. She then assaulted her, allegedly leaving her hospitalised for the day. Tfany claimed: Kiesha and Jade\u0027s daughter were the best of friends. They\u0027d been at my house for dinner just before the attack happened. There was a big group of them out and Jade\u0027s daughter had fallen out with her boyfriend. Kiesha went over to tell him everything would be alright and Jade\u0027s daughter just said \u0027I\u0027m going to tell my mum.\u0027 Kiesha rang me panicking saying her friend\u0027s mum was \u0027coming down to get her\u0027. I just reassured her, thinking \u0027what mum was going to do anything to a child?\u0027 The rest of the group started walking to the shop and Jade then pulled up and got out of the car and assaulted her. As the youngster lay injured on the pavement, concerned passersby ran to her rescue and called the emergency services.  Tfany, a cleaning supervisor, and her partner were forced to rush out of work after a friend called them in a panic. The mum said: Kiesha was in [the hospital] for a few hours because they needed to keep her an eye on her due to her head. She claims that her daughter is now so scared that she won\u0027t even leave the house without her brother. Kiesha doesn\u0027t go out anymore, Tfany said. There\u0027s a shop at the top of the road and she won\u0027t go without her brother. She added: Kiesha does nothing and has got a very negative outlook on le. A year and half later, my daughter is still seeing a counsellor, still has flashbacks of that awful night. She now has a barrier up which she will not lower and she don\u0027t understand how someone could do what this evil person did and yet get away with it.

The event, at Kensington Palace, is the first official engagement Doria Ragland has been on since her daughter became a fully-fledged member of the royal family. The Duchess of Sussex is marking the launch of her first solo project Together: Our Community Cookbook -a charity cookbook in aid of those affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy. The 37-year-old is joined by Prince Harry, 34, for the book launch, which is taking place on the palace grounds. She smiled warmly as she stepped out of a vehicle with her mother, while wearing a Tuxe top, Misha Nonoo skirt and Smythson blue coat. In a touching moment, Ms Ragland said I\u0027m Meg\u0027s mum as she introduced herself to the woman behind the Grenfell cookbook. She then hugged and told the women: \u0027I\u0027m just as excited as you are.  I\u0027m so glad I can put the face with the recipes. I\u0027m going to make everything.  The power of women. We make things happen. We\u0027re curious, we say yes, we show up. I\u0027m inspired.    Baroness Gail Rebuck, chair of publisher Penguin Random House, told Ms Ragland she must feel “very proud” of the duchess and her work on the cookbook, to which she replied head over heels. The former Suits actress had met a group of women during secret visits to the community who had started cooking for people around them whose lives had been destroyed by the disaster. She became close with the team at the Hubb Community Kitchen in the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in West London. When she discovered they could only open two days a week because of funding, an idea was born and now months later she has launched their charity cookbook. As well as promoting the fundraiser with a sweet video, she\u0027s written a very personal three-page foreword for the book. She speaks about her experiences meeting the women at the Hubb Community Kitchen and why she believes food is so important. The royal spoke passionately for around three minutes without notes about the project in her speech as Prince Harry and her mother looked on proudly. The Duchess of Sussex said: I\u0027m so privileged to know you. Working on this project for the past nine months has been a tremendous labour of love.   speech  I have just recently moved to London and I felt so immediately embraced by the women in the kitchen, by your kindness and to be in this city and be in this room and see how multi-cultural it was.  On a personal level I feel so proud to live in a city with so much ersity. This whole country is represented by the people in the kitchen. It\u0027s pretty outstanding. There\u0027s so many people to thank - I\u0027m extremely grateful because this is my first project and I appreciate your support. It truly took a village to see this through. Everyone has embraced this so fully because it has been a passion project for us all. As I said this is more than a cook book and what I mean by that is the power of food is more than just the meal itself it is the story behind it. And when you get to know the story behind the recipe, you get to know the person behind it and help us celebrate what connects us rather than ides us. That is the ethos of Together. Women of the Hubb Community Kitchen are showcasing their own personal recipes featured in the cookbook, many of which have been handed down through generations.  The duchess is joining them as they cook the dishes and assist with the preparations, before the group and the duke and duchess sit to enjoy the freshly made food with their guests. Dishes were handed out to those attending in the outdoor reception at the palace where there were long tables decorated with brightly coloured flowers. Homemade dishes including coconut chicken curry, aubergine masala and a range of chapatis and sharing dips, as well as caramelised plum upside-down cake, and spiced mint tea.  Meghan continued in her speech: Thank you so much for letting me be part of this and letting me be on this adventure with you and I’m so excited to see the projects we will continue to do in your community and also how you will inspire people globally by sharing your stories and your recipes. It\u0027s so impactful. You can see that in just a few days alone what\u0027s happened and the book\u0027s not out yet. What you have been able to do is a testament to what that means to people. I\u0027m so proud of you. So on that note I know that some of you have started eating, as you should. I\u0027d be the last one to want to let the food get cold so please enjoy your beautul lunch and give another round of applause for the Hubb Community Kitchen. Thank you.  Meghan, her mother and Prince Harry made their way around four food stations, with the duchess helping to cook along the way. Ahlam Saeid had prepared a huge bowl of green rice at the first stop, to which the duchess added fresh mint and olive oil. Ms Ragland asked the cooks questions about the ingredients, while one of the cooks promised to set food aside for the royal couple. The duchess told her: Oh thank you, I\u0027ll take that home and have it for dinner. Meghan appeared to be a dab hand in the kitchen as she confidently flipped chapatis and turned koftas on the grill. Meanwhile the duke was several steps behind, chatting to guests and watching his we proudly. Following lunch, the trio posed for a group photo with the women of the kitchen and their families then stayed to talk to them.    Kensington Palace previously shared a touching video of Meghan working in the kitchen and chatting with the women to promote the new project. She also wrote an emotional three-page foreword for the book, which can now be pre-ordered on Amazon for just \u0026pound9.99. In it she recalls the moment she heard about the Grenfell fire when she was working in Canada, and how she wanted to help. She writes about visiting the kitchen when she was getting used to le in London with Prince Harry and the incredible women she met. Details of her favourite meals are also shared including collard greens, black-eyed peas and cornbread, which reminds her of her childhood.  The duchess went to meet those affected by the Grenfell disaster at least twice at the beginning of the year, including a trip to the Al Manaar community mosque, which lies in the shadow of the charred shell of Grenfell Tower. She was without Prince Harry but was accompanied by a royal protection officer and one of the prince’s aides. The visits were compared to many made by her late mother-in-law Princess Diana, who often carried out charity work in secret. Speaking at the time, a leading Grenfell community member said: Meghan\u0027s visits mean so much to us. She has a special place in our hearts. A royal source added: Ms Markle has regularly been making private visits to organisations as she gets to know the charity sector.

Jurors were shown footage of Mohammed Abdul, 21, allegedly driving his Suzuki Vitara past bouncers and into revellers. CCTV footage appears to show the vehicle coursing down an alleyway packed with clubbers before later ploughing into the venue itself. From a camera inside Blake\u0027s in Gravesend, Kent, the vehicle\u0027s front lights can be seen getting closer and closer as dancers mingle, unaware the Suzuki is hurtling towards them.  One man can then be seen spread-eagled on the bonnet, swept off his feet as the Suzuki rams into him from behind. Others are seen fleeing to safety as security guards appear in hot pursuit of the car, shortly before midnight on March 17 this year. The car can be seen reversing, its registration plate hanging off at an angle, as patrons stagger to get to their feet. Some clubbers can be seen appearing to swarm the vehicle and showering it with a volley of thumps, while others look visibly distressed in the corner of the nightclub.  Abdul is on trial at Maidstone Crown Court for attempted murder over the incident which left eight people injured. The court heard he had been ejected from the venue at around 11.40pm for being too drunk. His trial was told that while in a rage and acting aggressively, he threatened bouncers, telling doorman Peter Muro: If I can\u0027t come in I\u0027m going to come back and shut this place down and kill you guys. Abdul ed in his vehicle around 10 minutes later and drove at speed down a narrow alleyway by the side of the club, with door staff and clubbers jumping or being pulled out of the way, prosecutor Simon Taylor said.  The alleyway housed a marquee attached to the club with a dance floor and DJ booth, and it was filled with revellers there to see grime rapper Giggs. Abdul, of Deptford, south-east London, accepts he was the driver of the vehicle and has admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving, jurors heard. But he denies two counts of attempting to murder persons in the vicinity of the club and an alternative charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.

Despite many Brits claiming to be “foodies” only one in five eat lunch purely for pleasure and taste. Nearly eight in ten say they are bored by their lunch choices and 78 per cent chow down at midday simply to keep their energy levels up. The research, commissioned by The New York Bakery Co., found nearly half of those polled face a daily dose of “lunch envy”, craving a friend or colleague’s midday meal rather than their own. It also revealed the average Brit forks out a whopping \u0026pound6.08 on average each day on lunch alone, with those in London spending \u0026pound15.51.  Christina Honigfort, from The New York Bakery Co., said: “This research highlights that the British workforce desperately needs to revamp its lunch and inject some excitement into the midday meal. “We want to inspire Brits to ditch the soggy sandwiches and love their lunch once again. Making small changes, such as trying something new for our lunch time meal, is the perfect way to add some flavour and iety to the working week.” The Great British lunch survey laid bare eating habits across the country, with Leeds folk revealed to be the ones to most likely tuck in to a humble pie and mash for sustenance. Those from Plymouth were revealed to be the most likely to grab a Cornish pasty and Liverpudlians confessed to tucking into a bowl of pasta when the clock strikes twelve. Glasweigians were revealed to sink their teeth into a microwave meal the most often, and Leicester was found to be the bagel capital of the UK. The research also revealed three-quarters of Brits bring their lunches with them from home, with Londoners the most likely to enjoy last night’s leftovers. Eighty one per cent of those polled admit that they are never adventurous with their lunches, despite spending over half an hour each morning to ponder our choices available to us.  And it could have big consequences - with a sensitive nine per cent confessed that a bad lunch experience can ruin their whole afternoon. When asked where Brits would most like to the munch their lunch, the majority of those polled declared New York the winner, wishing to sample some of the city’s famous flavours. Paris came in second and LA and Tokyo came joint third. Honigfort added: “We spend so much of our time sat at our desks, it’s good to mix things up and have something to look forward to at lunchtime.

There\u0027s a lot to think about, from the location to the dress, the honeymoon and the cake, and the cost can quickly add up  you\u0027re not careful with your budget. So it\u0027s no surprise that some women take a long time - sometimes years - to plan their dream day. But it turns out that a few brides-to-be also expect their wedding party to take a lot of time out of their busy lives to help them plan - and they become bridezillas  things don\u0027t quite work out.  This is the situation a woman going by the name Marissa  found herself in recently after being asked to be her best friend\u0027s maid of honour, reports The Sun . Let\u0027s just say it didn\u0027t end well. Marissa shared her story on Facebook , where she revealed that in April her friend demanded her boyfriend propose to her by the end of July. If the man in question didn\u0027t meet her deadline, she would start giving him the silent treatment.  The future hubby planned on popping the question within the allotted time frame, but asked Marissa and friends to try and mislead his partner so she would be surprised when the moment came. During a night out, Marissa and a friend try to talk her off a clf by trying to convince her to compromise and show a little patience. But their words didn\u0027t have the desired impact. I later find out she cried the whole ride home, started a fight with future hubby about being an a**hole for not proposing and cried herself to sleep that night, said Marissa. She also claimed that we bullied her into thinking he wasn\u0027t going to propose - ever.  But sure enough the proposal did happen, and Marissa, having been friends with the bride-to-be for over 20 years, agreed to be maid of honour, despite the fact that they were growing apart. Pretty soon she began regretting her decision. A month or two later, I noty her that I am planning on competing in a fitness show PRIOR to her wedding. This means the whole competition would be over before her wedding. She cries, tells me I am being selfish, and then proceeds to say I won\u0027t be any fun at the bachelorette.  Shame on me for not stopping my entire le to accommodate her wedding YEAR. When the hen party rolled around, the bride threw a tantrum as her Gatsby-themed bash had to be toned down due to budget restrictions. Marissa then found herself forced to work the bar at the event as the bride had failed to hire people to help. Ironically this caused the bride to brand her antisocial for not being more involved at the party. Even when she discovered her boyfriend had been cheating on her, Marissa still attempted to keep a smile on her face and do everything she could to make the bride\u0027s big day perfect.  She agreed to pay \u0026pound153 for her dress, she picked up an \u0026pound88 tab for lunch on the day they went dress shopping and spent around \u0026pound609 on the wedding shower, with a little help from bridesmaids. Despite her best efforts Marissa was then ghosted by the bride for a week after the shower - all because she\u0027d gone to her cousin\u0027s finance\u0027s hen do instead of going food shopping with the bride.

The eerie sight stunned locals in western Greece, where creepy crawlies went to work creating a blanket covering a huge area of greenery. The web, in Aitoliko, is around 1,000ft, or 300 metres, in size. Experts believe that warm weather is to blame, with conditions ideal for spiders who come to the tourist hotspot to mate. A rise in the mosquito population could also explain the phenomenon.  The spiders behind the unusual masterpiece are reported to be Tetragnatha insects. But anyone who wants to see the web should get there soon, as it is not expected to last long.  Professor Maria Chatzaki told Newsit.gr : High temperatures, sufficient humidity and food created the ideal conditions for the species to reproduce in large numbers.  It\u0027s as  the spiders are taking advantage of these conditions and are having a kind of a party.

From buying props to travelling across the world, those who want to increase their following will do just about anything for the \u0027gram.  Recently one woman received death threats over a photo she posted on Instagram which was meant to reflect her perfect morning.  With a plate full of tortilla wraps passed off as crepes and ious other staged pieces, the image went viral. Now another picture is doing the same for a very similar reason.   Instagram star Harimao Lee has been slammed for sharing an over-the-top photo of a plane journey with her 127,000 followers.   The photographer travelled from Hong Kong to Rome with Cathay Pacic in a business class cabin and shared a picture of herself inside, sipping champagne and stargazing while draped in fairy lights.  People were quick to mock her for the image, which had very clearly been staged. One user commented: Ridiculous fairy lights aside, lady you are sitting on the business class seats BACKWARDS with your head inches away from the TV monitor...this is so staged!    Another said: I wonder how much time and effort was spent preparing this photo compared to actually looking out of the window. I\u0027m not sure this is the best kind of advert for Cathay Pacic because it just looks a bit hollow, especially with the random fairy lights for no apparent reason. A third added: Oh ffs love neck your plonk, go to sleep and decide the next day  you actually have a le. Trying to bring back the romance and glamour of first class air travel? Amazing s one can go to to get ‘likes’, posted a fourth. Others branded the snap cringe and told her to get a le.  But not everyone was against the image, some people praised Harimao for her efforts to create a fairytale vibe. What a charming shot, said one person. It\u0027s so magical, commented another. Damn this is epic, wrote a third.

He admits he had to learn a lot from computers to be able to create the complex patterns which produce better results than by hand 3 of 15Talley Matthew, from LA, developed his style by making mistakes and realising he needed to learn the rules before breaking them. He studied fine art at college but quit when he felt he wasn\u0027t developing his skills. He then went on to combine his love of art with tattoos and his blackwork designs tie classic themes with contemporary iconography 4 of 15Jason Mosseri opened 1770 in Brighton in 2005 with Alex Binnie.

Mosseri began tattooing in 1997 and is not shy to push the boundaries 5 of 15Lesya Kovalchuk\u0027s love of literature and poetry shines through in her designs.

Mum-of-three Elvira Ferraii was staying at a remote beauty spot as the violent storm battered Ireland and the UK with 102mph winds and heavy rain. The holidaymaker\u0027s caravan was blown about 30ft down a rocky incline and smashed to pieces on the beach below as it was pounded by the tide. Ms Ferraii, who was in her 50s, had been planning to stay at the Clden ecoBeach Camping and Caravan Park, in County Galway, Ireland, for a number of weeks.  One of two people to die in the storm, she was rescued from the beach and rushed to hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her belongings, including a bicycle helmet, were scattered on the beach in the aftermath of the tragedy. Rolf Weber, a longtime friend and fellow adventurer, said he last saw Ms Ferraii two days before she left for Ireland on August 26 on a five-week trip to travel and learn English. The hiking and mountaineering enthusiast, who had three adult children, sent him a message just three days before she died to give him an update on her travels.   He told Extra: I am deeply shocked. This is just so tragic. She was excited about her trip.  We got a message from her last Sunday, 16th September, saying that she has left for a three-day trip to Clden after finishing her English studies. Mr Weber said Ms Ferraii had separated from her husband about 14 years ago and was a health worker who had carried out studies into Alzheimer\u0027s disease. She lived in Steinmaur, a municipality north of Zurich, and rarely travelled out of Switzerland, but she did a lot of travel within the country, he added. She was a godmother to one of Mr Weber\u0027s children, he added.  The mountaineering guide said: My we will be devastated. They were good friends. We have known her for at least 25 years. Our children went to school together. Just days before she left for Ireland, Ms Ferraii, the Webers and friends went on a seven-day, 50-mile hike. Ms Ferraii was one of two people killed in the storm. A worker at a forest park in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, died after he was hit by a tree. The man in his 20s was working on behalf of public utility Northern Ireland Water in Slieve Gullion Forest Park. A co-worker was injured.  A number of others were hurt as the storm damaged properties and brought down trees and power lines. In North West England, a woman was seriously injured after a tree fell onto her car in Cheshire. Two people were taken to hospital after a tree fell on a moving car in Alnwick, Northumberland. In the Scottish Highlands a man had to be rescued after becoming trapped under a digger in a river in the village of Rogart. The Met Office and Ireland\u0027s weather service had issued danger to le warnings before the storm hit.

We have been forced to change the defence with Murdoch out with a knee injury.“In the first 20 minutes, with Rachid Bouhenna starting, maybe not everyone was comfortable.“Afterwards we grew into the game and I don’t think that we made any mistakes.”Excuses, perhaps, but valid ones? Probably. Further to his points, when King, Paul McMullan and Fyvie, in particular, came on United kicked into gear.Ahead of Saturday’s trip to Falkirk, for the first time in a few weeks, Csaba will have options to consider from a squad he has, for all his critics, united behind one cause.Stanton is expected back in training while the trio aforementioned will have played themselves into the gaffer’s thoughts.Arabs heading through on Saturday will be looking for three points after draws against Alloa and Morton in their last two league matches.And rightly so, to push themselves back into promotion contention they will have to pick up three points with more regularity.However, Csaba has defended their record so far which sees them lie in fth position – just three points behind leaders Inverness Caley Thistle, saying: “We have had four games in a row without losing – two wins and two draws – so psychologically the team are showing spirit which is good.“They  have stuck with us for three years, this is the third year in the Scottish Championship and I think, not just the fans, but everybody is hoping we can go up.“This is a normal reaction, I understand them but they also must understand that we are also human and are trying to do the best for the club.“The fans have to appreciate the work that has been put in, the season is just beginning and it is only five games.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7bd9b8dfe43.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlo says fraser fyvie has all the right stuff","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United manager Csaba Laszlo was delighted to welcome club captain Fraser Fyvie back to the fold on Saturday and believes he is just what they need to push on.The midfield man came off the bench on 73 minutes after recovering from a long-term knee injury and made a huge impact for the Terrors.With practically the last kick of the game Fyvie netted a terric half-volley to equalise after Morton had taken the lead through a Michael Tidser penalty on 11 minutes.It was not just the goal, but his overall play, which pleased Csaba.“I am happy to have him back, not just because he scored the goal, but he is a player who can create chances and shoot,” he said.“In the last 20 minutes he showed his experience and he knows what you have to do.“He comes on and in just 20 minutes he shoots three times. Two were very dangerous and the third was the goal.“Fraser is definitely a leader but we must be careful with him because he had two cruciate ligament problems so it has not been easy for him to handle this psychologically.”Ahead of Saturday’s trip to face bottom side Falkirk, Csaba has decisions to make in his midfield.After his dominant 20-minute display at Tannadice, Fyvie will be in contention to start and Csaba also revealed Sam Stanton is close.“It is good that he is making competition. Him and Sam Stanton must come back, hopefully, very quick. Maybe this week he will begin training,” he added.“He is also a creative midfielder who can score goals from the middle.“He scored a fantastic goal against Queen of the South.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united gaffer csaba laszlo blasts referee after spot kick call","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United manager Csaba Laszlo has hit out at referee Colin Steven after he gave a controversial penalty against his side on Saturday.Steven pointed to the spot on 11 minutes when debutant Rachid Bouhenna was adjudged to have fouled Morton defender Gregor Buchanan in the box from a corner.Michael Tidser stepped up to give the ’Ton the lead in a Championship game which finished 1-1 thanks to substitute Fraser Fyvie’s last-minute equaliser.Although Csaba was pleased with the fight they showed to win a point, he was frustrated at the referee’s performance.“I am really proud of the boys because it was a really dficult game,” he said.“You get a penalty against you, and I don’t want to talk about the performance of the referee because it’s not my job, but I thought it was a foul for us at first.“I didn’t hear the whistle, then the referee shows for the penalty but I think, to be honest,  he gives this penalty then he has the chance to give 10 others for both sides.“It’s just my opinion and it is not all about the penalty. I don’t want to criticise the referee but, according to me, it was a very soft penalty.“I asked my players  there was contact there but they didn’t think it was one which you have to give.”Of United’s display, Csaba added: “I think for 90 minutes plus added time we played one-way football.“The boys tried hard and it’s not easy when the clock is ticking down and you still can’t score.“In the first-half we had two very good chances where we should score and in the second half we were pressing Morton.“They were, more or less, 11 behind the ball playing very deep and they tried to counter attack.“Sometimes you have these games where you have to suffer but we have to be more clinical, must be more clinical.“We can talk about the many mistakes but we have to play faster, more with the ball into feet and up front but I think on Saturday everybody showed spirit.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba0ce600a7e5.jpg ","title":"new boy rachid bouhenna says dundee united have to work to win back supporters","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United defender Rachid Bouhenna insists they must repay the fans for their support with a win at Falkirk on Saturday.The French-Algerian centre-back made his United debut in their disappointing 1-1 draw with Morton at Tannadice at the weekend.The Terrors now travel west for a crucial Championship tie after captain Fraser Fyvie, ing from a long-term injury off the bench, salvaged a point with a last-minute strike against Jonatan Johansson’s side – who took an early lead through a Michael Tidser penalty.And Bouhenna says they will do everything they can to pick up three points and get the Arabs back onside ahead of, what he insists is, a continued promotion push.“Of course for Dundee United the objective is to go to the top league, the Premiership, so we have to win these games at home and get results away,” he said.“Saturday we lost two points, we need to win the supporters back this weekend at Falkirk and I hope next year we will play in the top tier.“The fans were amazing, we need them for the rest of the season and I think they are behind us.“After the game I thought it was a good game but we had many chances to score and didn’t take them.“It’s good to come back to draw but for the next game we have to win  we want to stay near the top of the Championship.”Despite hauling down Gregor Buchanan for the penalty which Tidser converted to give the Ton the lead on 11 minutes, Bouhenna was pleased with his first run-out in tangerine.However, The 27-year-old was not happy with referee Colin Steven’s call to award the spot-kick after the tussle with Buchanan at a corner and Bouhenna expressed his surprise given the physical nature of Scottish football.He added: “It was an OK debut I think.“Only really the foul for the penalty – I can’t believe it.“I don’t think it was, he did not have the ball and we are in a duel but I don’t know why.“It was not just the penalty, it was every ball the referee whistle against us.“It is not like Algeria or France, for sure.“It is more physical but Morton was a very physical game – that is the big dference and I think we can play more football at home.“Away it will be very dficult, you saw in the last game at Alloa you can’t play because of a dficult pitch but at home we have to play more.“Next game it will be very dficult when we play against Falkirk, so we have to get used to this.”Bouhenna is still settling into le in Dundee and getting to grips with the language – not to mention the accent.However, he still feels at home after being welcomed by everyone at the club.Skipper Fyvie, in particular, impressed the big defender with his influence on the side when he entered the fray on 73 minutes.The 25-year-old changed the game and got the equaliser with a ferocious half volley in second-half stoppage time.“Fraser has the experience, when he come on to pitch he helped us.“He is good for us and I hope in the next game he can continue to help us  he is in the starting XI or comes on to the pitch.“I am enjoying being at Dundee United, I am feeling very good.“My team-mates and everybody at the club have been very nice, they feel like family and I am very happy with it.“With the manager and the team-mates it is very good but we have to keep going, keep working and think about the next game.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.146874.jpg ","title":"tay road bridge lift out of action for eight weeks while replacement is

It has been handed in to the council.A spokeswoman for the Highland LGBTI forum, which is organising the rally, said Mr Morrison was entitled to his opinions,\"I have no problem with him or the people who have signed the petition holding their views and I totally respect that but there are a lot of other people who don\u0026rsquot hold those views,\" she said.\"You will always get people who don\u0026rsquot like LGBT stuff.\"Referring to his comments about people frolicking on rainbow-coloured floats, she said: \"Basically this is a celebration and  he doesn\u0026rsquot like people dancing and enjoying themselves, I could see that would be a problem for him.\"She said there was nothing illegal about the proposed parade.\"Obviously, nothing untoward will be happening during the march,\" she said. \"It will be totally family-friendly.\"He has a moral objection which is his personal objection and he is perfectly entitled to that.

first","story":"\u0026nbspA DOCTOR and a former detective have joined forces to launch Scotland\u0027 first absinthe blanche using ingredients hand-picked from around their 500-year-old ancestral home by the shores of Loch Ness.The couple, Lorien and Kevin Cameron-Ross, creators of the award-winning Loch Ness Gin, developed the recipe for Loch Ness Absinthe, both distilled at their home on the banks of the loch, following a trip to the birthplace of the spirit, Val-de-Travers in Switzerland.It was there Lorien learned to fine-tune the craft of making absinthe which was first used as a medicinal remedy by a French doctor living in the country, Pierre Ordinaire around the 1790s.Although best known as absinthe verte, the notorious \"green drink\", popular in the late 19th and early 20th century among artists and writers in Paris, with Vincent Van Gogh and Ernest Hemmingway among its devotees, the couple decided to create their own Scottish blanche recipe.Blanche absinthe dates back to 1910 following the ban of green absinthe in ious countries \u0026ndash although not in the UK \u0026ndash due to unproven fears it had hallucinogenic properties resulting from the use of thujone, a component of wormwood.This led to the illegal production of clear absinthe in Switzerland, making it harder for the authorities to identy.Lorien said: \"We are really proud of our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe, boasting our very own homegrown botanicals including wormwood mixed with nearby fresh water which flows into the famous loch.\"We felt there was gap in the market for an absinthe blanche in Scotland, a drink I really enjoy, so decided to put the wheels in motion last year and began to research its history and fully understand the craft of creating and distilling it.\"Loch Ness Absinthe, with a ABV of 53 per cent, is less potent that absinthe verte, which is usually around 72 per cent.The couple, who are firm believers in mindful drinking where you drink less and enjoy yourself more, recommend that Loch Ness Absinthe should be enjoyed slowly as an aperit, ideally in a mix of one-part absinthe to three parts iced water, poured over a sugar cube on the glass\u0027 rim.Lorien continued: \"I\u0026rsquove worked really hard to get the recipe for our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe exactly the way I wanted and in the process perfected the art of distilling it to get the exact results I was looking for.\"With the help and support of Kevin, I\u0026rsquove created a drink that I\u0026rsquom really pleased with, which has already received fantastic feedback, leading to us driving our plans forward to launch even more products in the near future that will continue to be inspired by the loch and the land around us.\"Thursday 20 Sep 2018

march","story":"\u0026nbspA GAY pride march in Inverness could get the green light as early as this week.The planned Proud Ness parade, which is expected to take place in Inverness on October 6, has been overshadowed by a row between religious objectors and counter petitions.The row erupted last week, shortly after Donald Morrison, a home mission worker with the Free Church of Scotland , submitted a petition of around 600 to 700 names opposing what he deemed the \"unsavoury event\".The move sparked a furious response from other sections of the community, with three separate petitions launched supporting the Gay Pride march. They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Thursday 20 Sep 2018 4:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116850.jpg","title":"New social enterprise cafe set for grand opening","story":"\u0026nbspA QUIRKY caf\u0026eacute that could be run by former prisoners in an attempt to reduce re-offending rates is opening in Inverness this week.The venue at 86 Church Street called Ar n-\u0026Agraveite, which translates to Our Place, will be officially opened by Inverness MP Drew Hendry at noon on Thursday.It aims to \u0026lsquorebuild\u0026rsquo people\u0027 lives after jail, giving them work and a chance to be a part of society.More than 50 volunteers are needed in the first year to run the venture and make it financially viable.Andrew Fowler, from the charity Signpost, which is spearheading the caf\u0026eacute scheme, said: \"We genuinely believe that we will be preparing people for work.

McKenna’s ascent has been rapid as the defender has started every game he has been fit for.Aston Villa and Celtic’s rejected bids were the latest in a number of moves for the centre-back.Hull City had three bids, with the final in excess of £1m, knocked back in January and Swansea City also made an approach for McKenna during the summer.McInnes said: “Scott deals with everything in his stride.“We are not dealing with someone who is a standard footballer.“He is something a bit special.“All he thought about was getting himself ready for the St Johnstone game.“They don’t make them like Scott too often these days.“He is a brilliant boy.“With all the experience I have in the game I can say to Scott with so much confidence that his time will come. Scott backs himself and trusts me.”McInnes recently claimed that McKenna, contracted to the Dons until 2023, will eventually leave Pittodrie on a “big ticket” move to the English Premier League.That could be as early as January  a club come in with a bid that meets the Reds’ valuation, early enough to find a replacement in that window.McKenna’s  from injury was a welcome boost at a time when eight players were ruled out for the trip to St Johnstone by injury or suspension.McInnes said: “Scott’s level of performance has been outstanding since he got into the team.“Defensively we have not been too bad and it has not been our biggest area of concern.“However, Scott’s  gives everyone a boost.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"fixed price 112000 two bedroom flat in bucksburn","story":"\t\t\t\t\t31a Mugiemoss Road, located in the city\u0026#8217s Bucksburn area, is a well maintained flat in a traditional granite building.Description: This lovely property comprises: entrance vestibule L-shaped hallway front facing lounge providing space for living and dining furniture stylish dining kitchen fitted with an array of base and wall storage units front facing double bedrooms with wardrobes which span one wall further good sized double bedroom which overlooks the rear and a centrally positioned shower room fitted with a 2 piece suite.Outside to the front is an exclusive section of garden.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Karen Wylie, 39, is hoping to raise \u0026pound80,000 to fly son Saul - who suffers from Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy - to America for surgery which will allow him to stand independently and potentially walk. The Post reported earlier this year on the family’s campaign to help Saul whose condition causes muscle stfness in his legs and arms, meaning he cannot stand or walk unaided. The family, from Tarbolton, are fundraising so they can travel the 4000 miles to Missouri for a spinal operation which would dramatically reduce Saul’s spasticity. They hope to take Saul to St Louis Children’s Hospital to see Dr TS Park, a pioneer in Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy  surgery. Karen said: “Our objective is to get Saul to the best possible stage to allow us to apply to St Louis Children’s Hospital for him to be evaluated for this le-changing surgery. This will involve intense physiotherapy blocks, the purchase of specialised equipment and working closely with ious professional therapists to get him strong enough. This will take some time but no dream will ever be too big for our boy, it might just take a little longer to get there.” Saul was born with twin brother Clay 12 weeks’ premature. Clay weighed 3lbs and Saul just 1lb. Clay was treated at Crosshouse Hospital near Kilmarnock for three months to allow his lungs to develop and learn to feed and has now made a full recovery. However, Saul was kept in Yorkhill Hospital for six months and spent most of his first year in hospital as he was so fragile. At 18 months old, he was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy. When Karen was pregnant with the twins, she and her husband Stuart were given the devastating news that Clay had a better chance of survival  Saul were to be terminated, something that was never option for them. Karen said: “We were told on several occasions that Saul was too tiny to survive but he continues to defy the experts and he is our little fighter.” Not a keen runner, Karen – who gave up work when the twins were born and cares for Saul on a full-time basis – is taking on the 10k with a group of 25 friends and her 66-year-old mum in order to raise the \u0026pound80,000 needed to take Saul to America. Karen said: “I am not a runner, but have been training three times a week for the event and can now manage to run 4.5 miles. My mum has never done anything like this before so is extremely nervous but very determined to complete the race for her grandson. “Our fundraising total is set at \u0026pound80,000 to cover my son’s surgery, specialised equipment, intense physio and a two- year rehabilitation programme. We have been campaigning for 18 weeks and have raised an incredible \u0026pound41,000 so far. “We have been overwhelmed by the kindness of friends and family who are willing to help raise funds for Saul’s journey, their generosity is very much appreciated and our family are exceedingly grateful to everyone who’s helped us on this journey. “We were extremely proud when Saul started school with his twin Clay and older brother Mylo, eight, this year. He attends Tarbolton Primary School and has several classroom assistants who support him depending on what activities are being done each day. “Like every parent we long for endless opportunities for our son. We are exceedingly grateful to everyone who has supported us on Saul’s journey to help make his dream come true – to walk like his brothers.” The run is on Sunday, September 30.

Eyewitnesses described a noise like an earthquake as the roof came crashing to the ground in Ayr\u0027s Phillips Square. Cars, including a Subaru Imprezza, were crushed underneath as the effect of Storm Ali was felt in full force. The impact of the storm blew the top of the flats off at around 1pm today. Resident David Hose, who stays on the top floor of the block, described the horrying moment.  David, 28, told the Ayrshire Post: It sounded like a mini earthquake, it was a bang like I\u0027d never heard before. I looked outside and couldn\u0027t believe what I was seeing. The roof was lying on the ground on top of cars and not far from the school playground. It\u0027s a miracle it didn\u0027t kill anyone. Gordon Baillie, 36, a night porter at Ayr\u0027s Mercure Hotel, added: I was sitting on the couch watching telly and heard a big bang. I went to the window and saw my neighbour looking at his car as his Subaru was stuck underneath it. They\u0027ve taped everything off and we\u0027re blocked inside.

John Rowan was just 50. The stalwart of Ayr Boswell Boys Club, who once guarded the Queen, made his final journey as he was laid to rest this week. And son Mason, 21, said: “He was a legend to us all. “Dad moaned about a lot of stuff in le, but never his cancer. “Even when he was told he had three years to live, he made sure he enjoyed it to the full.” In the end, an aggressive form of bowel cancer claimed John’s le just 10 months after his diagnosis. He spent time in the Territorial Army which took him south to London for a stint guarding Her Majesty. Mason recalls: “He got to be involved in some pretty exciting things by all accounts. “He was on duty for the state visit of Nelson Mandela and because of his work I was born down in London.”  But the former car salesman, who served Arnold Clark Toyota in Ayr and Kilmarnock, would become renowned for his service to Ayr Boswell. Mason said: “He set up the 1997s team with Stevie Devlin and brought through so many kids, myself included. “We’ll have so many memories - as diehard Ayr fans we loved going to Somerset Park. “It’s no coincidence that the last game we went to together was when we beat Killie and our picture ended up on the back page of the Ayrshire Post! “He was my dad, best mate and coach all in one.” A fundraiser of former Boswell players raised more than \u0026pound8000 at Dam Park this summer. The money split between the Ayrshire Hospice and Station 15 at Ayr Hospital. John is survived by we Catherine, children Mason, Jade and Chelsea and grandchildren Monty, Lucy and Zach.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow

Scott?\n\u0026ldquoThe signs would pinpoint people towards attractions and also where to park.\nSir Walter Scott dispensed justice from the bench in Selkirk for almost 30 years.\nAnd, as well as a town centre statue to celebrate the connection, his courtroom has been transformed into a museum to the world-famous author and poet.\nBut William Wallace\u0026rsquos connections to the town are every

local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum. A bullock donated by local farmer Robert Barr now has Muchacoo  on his passport after dozens of visitors to the Peebles Agricultural show each paid \u0026pound5 to name him.\nAll of the money raised will go towards the development of the Eastgate Theatre building.\nDiscussions are already underway about progressing to phase two which will improve and reconfigure the foyer/caf\u0026eacute areas.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sheriff-orders-gala-woman-to-hand-over-car-keys","story":"A GALASHIELS woman has been ordered to give up her car keys after being accused of two drink driving offences in the space of two months.\nJune McKain has been told she cannot drive a vehicle until the outcome of her trial in November.\nThe 58-year-old of Ladhope Crescent, appeared from custody at Selkirk Sherf Court where she pleaded not guilty to a charge of driving with a breath/alcohol count of 42 microgrammes -

We are all focused on working to ensure children are healthier, happier and stronger.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more-than-4000-rams-go-under-hammer-at-kelso-sales","story":"KELSO Ram Sales lived up to its international reputation yet again on Friday as turnover came within a whisker of matching last year\u0027s record.\nBuyers and sellers from across the UK and further afield converged on the Borders Union Showground for Europe\u0027s biggest one-day sheep sale.\nAnd from the 10am bell, this year rung by veteran breeder Jimmy Jeffrey, the 15 rings were a constant hive of activity throughout the day.\nTexels yet again proved to be the most lucrative with a top price of \u0026pound29,000 being reached for a Shearling from North Grangour in Lanarkshire.\nThe highest price paid for a Bluefaced Leicester Shearling was \u0026pound8,000 by the McClymont family of Tinnis above Selkirk.\nBy the end of the day\u0027s sale, a total of 3979 Shearlings and 411 Lambs had gone under the hammer.\nAllan Campbell\u0027s Texel topped the Lambs price lists after going for \u0026pound5,000, closely followed by another Texel from North Dorlaithers, which went for \u0026pound4,600.\nA total of seven dferent auctioneering companies managed to keep up with the demand from buyers.\nFollowing the day\u0027s business a total of \u0026pound2,991,860 had changed hands - just five percent down on 2017\u0027s record-breaking year when \u0026pound3million was reached for the first time.\nAnd the average price of \u0026pound681.52 was only \u0026pound28.22 down on last year, but up on previous years.\nMags Clark from the Border Union Agricultural Society was at the helm for the first time this year.\nShe said: \"The quality of the animals on sale at Kelso Ram Sales is always second to none and that\u0027s why we welcome buyers and sellers from across the UK and Ireland for this signicant event in the country\u0026rsquos agricultural calendar.\n\"We are extremely grateful to all our sponsors, trade stands, supporters and off course the buyers and sellers for their support of the 2018 Sale.\n\"We look forward to seeing you on the September 13, 2019.\"\nTop prices paid for Shearling breeds were: Beltex \u0026pound4,000, Berrichon \u0026pound450, Blue Texel \u0026pound700, Bluefaced Leicester \u0026pound8,000, Border Leicester \u0026pound1,300, Charmoise \u0026pound300, Charollais \u0026pound1,800, Dassenkop \u0026pound460, Dutch Texel \u0026pound1,800.

The cake was made by food artist and cake sculptor Michelle Wibowo and was featured on Channel 4\u0027s tea-time programme Extreme Cake Makers.  The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s le that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.

Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

TV presenter David Weinczok \u0026ndash known as \u0026lsquothe Castle Hunter\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash who will film a walking tour of the historic building which will be released as part of an eight-video series on Wednesday.  Dr Jeff Sanders, project manager at Dig It!, said of the Preston Tower edit-a-thon: \u0026ldquoYouTube and Wikipedia are two of the most popular websites in the world, which makes them the perfect place to inspire the next generation of castle enthusiasts.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking forward to shining a spotlight on some of these lesser-known but equally fascinating sites.  The event is funded by the Castle Studies Trust, and Jeremy Cunnington, chair of trustees, said: \u0026ldquoThe Castle Studies Trust is delighted to have funded these videos as it raises these important \u0026ndash but not well enough known \u0026ndash castles.  \u0026ldquoThe videos will hopefully encourage visitors to these sites and show how these \u0026ndash and all the other castles in Scotland \u0026ndash play an important part in Scottish history and heritage.  The other venues visited are in Midlothian, Fe, South Ayrshire and the Borders.  There will be two \u0026lsquoedit-a-thons\u0026rsquo events \u0026ndash part of Scotland\u0026rsquos Archaeology Month \u0026ndash which will held at the Riverside Museum in Glasgow on Tuesday and then the Engine Shed in Stirling next Friday .

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.  Filmed over the summer in Glasgow, the show sees five contestants begin the game with a case containing a secret amount of cash. Players answer questions to win visits to a soundproof vault where they can see inside their opponents\u0026rsquo cases. The twist: they don\u0026rsquot know how much is in their own case.  In a fast-paced endgame, players attempt to steal each other\u0026rsquos cases via tense head-to-head challenges, but only the player who gets over the finish line first will win what is inside their case. There is a potential jackpot of \u0026pound5,000.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos totally dferent to other game shows, Debs told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a good bit of comedy in it, which is why I\u0026rsquom there.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot speak, it\u0026rsquos all just done with my eyes and facial expressions.

The 45-minute show starts on Monday at 2.15pm on BBC One and\u0026nbspruns for 20 episodes.  Explaining how the role came about, Debs said: \u0026ldquoI basically got a call asking  I could speak to production. It was quite surreal. I didn\u0026rsquot have to audition or anything.  The stage is nothing new for the former Centre Stage director. She left the theatre group in 2016 to give herself \u0026ldquoa wee chance and still acts in local productions.  She now runs Quirky Pond, a theatre company, with friend Yvonne Rowley. Their next show is The Naked Truth, running on November 2 and 3.  \u0026ldquoQuirky Pond is getting bigger and bigger, she said.  \u0026ldquoThe Naked Truth will have two days at The Brunton [in Musselburgh].  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about five women who take up pole dancing classes, for a iety of reasons. One of the characters finds out she has cancer, so she wants to have a fundraiser.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a mix between Calendar Girls and The Full Monty but we all keep our clothes on.  But Debs still keeps an eye on Centre Stage with everything else going on.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove offered to help  they need me but I think they\u0026rsquore doing quite well themselves, she said.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom going to try and get to their panto this year.  \u0026ldquoNext year is their 40th year, so it\u0026rsquos a big anniversary for them.

Dunbar Cement Plant, which employs more than 140 people and contributes \u0026pound8 million to the local economy each year, has now been given the go-ahead to create a cement mill grinding station, storage silo and ious other facilities.  According to the planning officer\u0026rsquos report: \u0026ldquoIn a supporting statement submitted with the application it is stated that the proposal is part of Tarmac\u0026rsquos long-term internal upgrade and modernisation programme at Dunbar cement works.  \u0026ldquoIt asserts that the cement mill is necessary to produce new grades of cement required for modern construction and the cement market.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed mill will replace two existing mills on the site and will be more energy-efficient and quieter than those existing mills.  \u0026ldquoThe supporting statement also asserts that the cement works benefits from rail sidings on both the south and north side of the East Coast Mainline.  \u0026ldquoTrains run under a load out structure that feeds cement into rail tankers.  \u0026ldquoAt present, trains are fed only on the south side using adjacent silos where train capacity is already fully used.  \u0026ldquoAdditional products must therefore be exported by road.  \u0026ldquoUntil the late 1980s, the northern siding was also fed by a large silo that was dismantled. It is now proposed to reinstate a modern silo on this side to increase rail capacity.  Oliver Curtin, Dunbar Cement Plant manager, was pleased that permission had been granted, with further permissions to be secured before work gets under way, with staff levels to remain the same.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore pleased that East Lothian Council has approved our application to upgrade the facilities at Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThe plans will allow us to bring the latest technology to our operations, build on our offer to customers and maximise use of the rail network for transportation across Scotland and England.  \u0026ldquoWe will now work with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to secure appropriate operating permits.  \u0026ldquoOnce the necessary environmental permissions are in place, we will create a detailed plan for construction and operational timescales."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-pub-named-scotlands-best","story":"  The Volunteer Arms, known as Staggs, has been named\u0026nbspthe best pub in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.  In Italy, the duo will be competing to become both WTKA Muay Thai and K1 world champions.  Scott Hendry founded the club with friend Charles Cameron in 2014, and currently trains both Lewis and Faith.  \"Definitely, we could have two world champions coming back in November,\" he told the Courier.  \"They could come back with both titles which would be a tremendous achievement.\"  Faith\u0027s exploits are all the more impressive considering she has only been in the sport since May 2017.  \"Faith has been pretty remarkable,\" Scott said. \"She\u0027s had eleven fights in the space of a year.  \"She\u0027s won four titles and she\u0027s ranked number two in the UK.  \"She\u0027s fought the girl who is ranked number one four times and beat her three times.  \"I\u0027ve calculated it and she should move to number one by the end of the year.\"  The club, who train in the Bronx Boxing Gym in Tranent, will hold a fundraiser on Sunday.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"relieve-the-gsa-of-responsibility-for-mackintosh-building-art-experts-suggestion-to-msps","story":"  Currently burnt-out, the Mackintosh Building is still at the heart, and perhaps is the soul, of the art school.  However, should the building, disastrously ruined by fire twice in four years, still be run by the educational institution?  That is the provocative question that will be posed to Members of the Scottish Parliament tomorrow by one of Scotland\u0027s leading Mackintosh experts, the writer and gallerist Roger Billclfe.  Mr Billclfe, a vocal critic of the GSA\u0027s responsibility for, and handling of, the building\u0027s first fire in 2014, has suggested in a submission to MSPs that the GSA should be \"relieved of the responsibility\" of the \u0027Mack\u0027.  He says that by the time the building is rebuilt - which GSA chair Muriel Gray said could take up to six years - it will have not been used as a place of teaching for more than a dozen years.  Billclfe believes that the building should be treated as a \"world class work of art\" and could be used as artist accommodation and for exhibitions.  : The Mackintosh Building will be rebuilt says chair  In the conclusion to his submission he says that, because of the unanswered questions around the 2014 fire, the GSA is \"unfit\" to be a custodian of the building.  Mr Billclfe said: \"Temporary accommodation put in force after the 2014 fire will likely have had to be replaced by more permanent arrangements.  \"This seems to be a suitable time to consider relieving the School of its responsibility for the Mackintosh building - something it is believed to have considered in the 1990s when it offered the building to a government agency - and removing the inherent dangers associated with its occupation by a large body of students.  \"This would remove from the School the apparent burden of running a major \u0026lsquomuseum\u0026rsquo and also satisfy the growing demand for access, particularly after the injection of \u0026pound30m of public, private and charitable donations to restore the building following the 2014 fire.\"  Mr Billclfe, whose latest book is \u0027Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Art of the Four\u0027, believes the Mackintosh Building, consumed in a blaze for which no cause has yet been established, should be rebuilt from the architect\u0027s plans.  : How the Mack will be remade: Muriel Gray interview  The Committee\u0026nbspis also hearing evidence from Eileen Reid, the former head of widening participation at the school, the architect Malcolm Fraser, and Stuart Robertson, director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society.  The prospect of the GSA giving up their right to the building appears unlikely.  However, there was much anger expressed after the June fire, and how two blazes could have occurred in four years.  The first fire, in 2014, was sparked by an projector igniting some expanded foam being used by a student for a degree show.  Until the police and fire service investigation into the new blaze is complete and published, observers, the public and alumni are in want of reply to questions over cause and responsibility.  : The new Mack will be paid for by insurance and fund raising  A spokesman for the GSA said: \"The Mackintosh Building was commissioned and designed as an art school and GSA is fully committed to it ing as a working art school.\"  In the Herald on Sunday, the chair of the GSA board, Muriel Gray, was adamant the GSA will restore the Mackintosh Building.  Ms Gray said: \"This time it will be built with such knowledge and expertise that we have learned since 2014.  \"We are resolved that the Mackintosh comes back as a working art school, as a major player, a cultural leader for the city and the Scottish economy.\"  She added: \"Imagine the thrill of saying, \u0027We have an architect for this project: who is it? Charles Rennie Mackintosh.\u0027\"  \"The roads lead back to Mackintosh, absolutely and non-negotiably.  \"As far as we are concerned that decision we made in 2014 has just been interrupted.\"  It has been estimated that the cost could be more than \u0026pound100m, but Ms Gray said she hoped this would be met by insurance and a private funding raising initiative, rather than rely on public funds.  : Mackintosh expert on the rebuild at book festival  The building was insured through an Owner Controlled Insurance Programme .  This was held in the name of the GSA and Kier Construction Scotland Limited, which was in charge of the works at the building.  The restoration of the school following the 2014 fire was due to cost \u0026pound49m in total.  A paper for the Committee says that the GSA have \"communicated with donors regarding the 2018 fire and no donor has requested a  of their donation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-potent-questions-linger-around-the-mack-and-the-gsa","story":"  However, after two fires in four years, not only Mr Billclfe, who suggests the change in his submission to the Culture Committee of the Scottish Parliament, has expressed frustration and anger at the GSA.  In his submission, he says the Mack is a world class work of art - and should be henceforth treated as such.  He writes: \u0026ldquoIt would be unthinkable to restore a work of art from the National Galleries, say, and then offer access to it to the person who damaged it in the first place. But this is the scenario  the building is still to be retained by the School of Art on its current basis.  He also calls for a full investigation into the school\u0026rsquos administration at the time of the 2014 fire and subsequent refurbishment.  Billclfe, as others do, believes that the causes and circumstances of the original fire still pose many questions.  There is often anger when there are no quick or ready answers to potent and emotional questions. The world is waiting for the police and fire officers to investigate the ruins of the Mack, to find out what caused or accelerated the blaze this summer. I understand that the current theory is that the fire began in the roof of the east gable of the building, and then spread west and down to the ABC venue.

As is always the case with a leader\u0026rsquos speech the most colourful language was reserved for an attack on the party\u0026rsquos main opponents, the Tories and Labour the SNP did not merit a mention. They, claimed the Lib Dem chief, had turned from \u0026ldquobroad churches into intolerant cults.  Which, of course, has left the fourth force in Westminster politics with a golden opportunity.  Yet despite the fact that loyal lieutenants were stressing how the party had doubled its appeal, from 7.4 per cent at the last election to 11 per cent-plus now - actually, a recent poll put the Lib Dems on just six per cent - the yellow peril is not picking up support anywhere near where it should be.  Sir Nick Clegg branded Jeremy Corbyn and Labour \u0026ldquopants, while he dismissed Theresa May and the Tories as \u0026ldquorubbish. Yet,  this is true, then the Lib Dem surge should be happening. But it isn\u0026rsquot.  This is undoubtedly why Vince wants change but saying you want to create a \u0026ldquomovement of the moderates hardly gets the political pulse racing. Many Lib Dems insisted they were not moderates but radicals. And then there is the plan to open up a future leadership contest to non-MPs.  A ripple of expectation rose among the yellow T-shirts when the campaigning businesswoman Gina Miller gave a conference speech but swtly burst the bubble of expectation about her own ambitions when she told delegates that she was not their leader-in-waiting.  In his keynote address, Sir Vince urged Labour and Tory rebels to have the courage to leave and, by implication, join the Lib Dems. No names were mentioned but that of Labour\u0026rsquos Chukka Umunna has been on the lips of some delegates in a positive and a negative way.  And he sought to pile pressure on Jeremy Corbyn over the People\u0026rsquos Vote issue by telling the Labour comrades that  their leader does not back the second poll, then they should dump him.  But  the Lib Dems are to capitalise on the anti-Brexit sentiment, then they need an energetic, charismatic leader, who doesn\u0026rsquot fluff his lines, to lead the charge to keep Britain in the EU as soon as possible.

Tonight, the PM is expected to have face-to-face talks with Charles Michel, the Belgian premier, with further bilaterals with Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach, and Donald Tusk, the European Council President, tomorrow.  Mrs May is likely also to talk to other leaders in the margins of the summit in an effort to win backing for a plan which has met fierce resistance from within the ranks of her own Conservative Party.  Her message will be stark:  the EU does not show flexibility and the only deal she can take back to Westminster in November is an unsellable fudge, then MPs will vote it down and there will be a damaging no-deal.  In referring to the EU27\u0026rsquos improved offer, Mr Barnier also made clear that the \u0026ldquomoment of truth would come next month at the European Council. By then, he argued, it should be clear whether or not a deal can be done.  However, Brussels-watchers point out that there is a habit of the European Commission going to the brink and the Salzburg summiteers are expected to announce a special Council meeting in November, probably on the 13th and 14th, to formally seal a deal.

Ahead of today\u0026rsquos summit, Mr Tusk wrote to EU leaders said EU leaders should discuss arrangements for the \"final phase\" of the Brexit talks \"including the possibility of calling another European Council in November\".  He impressed on them the need for \"limiting the damage\" caused by Brexit and added: \u0026ldquoUnfortunately, a no-deal scenario is still quite possible. But  we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe.\"  Meanwhile, David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, said he expected just \"warm words\" from the EU leaders in Salzburg, stressing \u0026ldquothey won\u0027t give much\".  He asserted Mrs May\u0026rsquos ultimatum of her deal or no deal was a false choice and predicted the EU would \"pile on\" extra demands on money, migration and other issues.  \"All these things will come back and we\u0027ll see more and more pressure, and she will have a deal she won\u0027t be able to bring back to the House of Commons because it\u0027ll be lumbered with loads of other EU demands, so she\u0027s going to have to have something else,\" he told BBC Radio\u0026rsquos Today programme.

But Mrs May brushed aside the calls for a second referendum, saying voters had already made their decision.  \"When the referendum took place, we gave people the opportunity to make a choice. They made that choice,\" she declared.  \"This was probably the biggest exercise in democracy in our country\u0027s history. If we were to go back on that vote, it would destroy trust in politicians.  \"My answer to the People\u0027s Vote is that we\u0027ve had the people\u0027s vote - it was the referendum - and now we should deliver on it,\" she added.

To deny them a voice challenges the basic principle of informed consent.\"  And the crossbench peer warned: \"History will not, in our opinion, be kind to any politician who hides behind purely logistical arguments, legalese or arcane parliamentary procedure in order to deny people a vote on the outcome of these Brexit negotiations at such a fragile and crucial moment for our country.\"  With opinion polls regularly finding a majority of voters now think the UK made the wrong decision to leave in 2016, the People\u0027s Vote report said it was not too late to \"think again\" about Brexit.  There was \"no insurmountable political or procedural obstacle\" to putting the two-year Article 50 process on hold to provide time for the necessary legislation and practical arrangements to be put in place for a vote, it argued.  And the report said a decision to dump Brexit now would be \"cost-free\" as the UK could retain its existing EU membership terms, including its budget rebate and exemption from joining the euro - while rejoining years later would require them to be renegotiated from scratch.  Drawn up by a cross-party committee including pro-EU MPs, peers and MEPs from Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens, the roadmap outlined six possible routes to a fresh referendum but said others may emerge as events develop.  The report explained that  Mrs May secured a deal with Brussels this autumn, MPs could use parliamentary amendments to force a referendum either when voting on the deal itself or on later legislation to implement the withdrawal agreement.  If her deal were rejected by the Commons, it would be up to Speaker John Bercow to decide whether or not to permit MPs to vote on a fresh referendum when the PM faced Parliament to explain her next steps.  Although Mrs May has consistently said that she would not allow a second referendum, the report suggested she might decide that a public vote was the best way to win a mandate for her deal or to escape the \"constitutional crisis\" of no deal.  \"Facing the very real possibility of overseeing a deeply unpopular and potentially disastrous no-deal Brexit, she may decide that the only way to avert this outcome is to put her deal to the public through a People\u0027s Vote,\" suggested the report.  The sixth option of a vote following victory for a pro-referendum party in a snap general election within the next few months was judged \"very unlikely but not inconceivable\".  The roadmap made no recommendation on the question to be asked in any poll, something that would ultimately be a matter for the independent Electoral Commission.  But it said that, for reasons of \"simplicity, speed and clarity\", it was likely that a two-way choice - either \"the Government\u0027s deal versus stay\" or \"no deal versus stay\" - would be preferred over a multiple choice question.  Any vote should not be delayed by arguments over whether to extend the franchise to include 16 and 17-year-olds and expats or tighten social media rules.  But the report said social media companies should be warned they would face tougher regulation in future  they failed to take all actions within their power to prevent abuse of their platforms by campaigns.  David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, asked how likely a second referendum would be  Parliament willed it, replied: \"Pretty unlikely because most people understand to announce a second referendum would be to invite the European Union to give us the worst deal possible in order to persuade us to stay in.  \"That\u0027s the consequence of a second referendum and is why it\u0027s a very bad idea it\u0027s completely against the national interest.\""},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ends-funding-for-kezia-dugdales-defence-in-wings-over-scotland-defamation-case","story":"  The move, which exposes Kezia Dugdale to potentially signicant costs, has been seen by some of her fellow MSPs as a \u0026ldquobetrayal and \u0026ldquofactionalism by her pro-Corbyn enemies.  Mr Campbell, 50, who runs the nationalist Wings Over Scotland website from his home in Bath, is suing Ms Dugdale for \u0026pound25,000 in a defamation action started last November.  It followed the Lothians MSP accusing him in her Daily Record column of making a homophobic remark about gay Scottish Secretary David Mundell.  Mr Campbell had said Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos son, the Tory MSP Oliver Mundell, was \u0026ldquothe sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner\".  In her column, Ms Dugdale said she was \u0026ldquoshocked and appalled to see a pro-independence blogger\u0027s homophobic tweets - Mr Campbell vigorously denies homophobia.  Until now, the UK labour party in London has bankrolled all of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos legal support, paying for a QC and an advocate to conduct her defence at Edinburgh Sherf Court.  The costs so far are understand to be close to \u0026pound100,000.  However, to the shock of Ms Dugdale and many other Labour MSPs, the UK party has now ended the arrangement, leaving Ms Dugdale to fend for herself.  Although the party will bear all of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos costs to date, it will not pay for any more legal counsel or any damages and costs  she loses.  It is understood UK Labour, which raised \u0026pound56m last year, did not tell Ms Dugdale directly of its decision, but informed her lawyers that it was no longer standing behind her case.  Ms Dugdale, 37, who was Scottish Labour leader from 2015 to 2017, opposed Jeremy Corby becoming UK leader, earning the lasting resentment of his supporters, who now dominate the party apparatus.  As the publisher of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos column, it is understood the Daily Record may now supply Ms Dugdale with legal support for the rest of the case.  However any help would not extend to damages and costs  Mr Campbell won his case.  Earlier this month, Sherf Kenneth McGowan refused Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos request to have the action thrown out and agreed to proceed to an evidential hearing.  Ms Dugdale had been on the point of appealing that decision when UK Labour withdrew its support, forcing her to scramble to lodge the appeal.  Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos spokesman said: \u0026ldquoGiven the principles on which it was founded - equality, fairness and justice - the UK Labour Party wholeheartedly committed to paying all legal costs associated with this case from start to finish.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much hoped that all promises will be kept.  UK Labour said: \u0026ldquoIt would be inappropriate to comment on a live, ongoing legal case.  Mr Campbell declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"carwyn-jones-general-election-needed-if-edinburgh-and-cardiff-vote-against-mays-brexit-plan","story":"  And the Labour leader made clear that a rejection of a Brexit deal by either the Scottish Parliament or Welsh Assembly could also eventually trigger a second referendum on the UK\u0027s relationship with the EU.  Wales voted to leave the bloc by a margin of 52.5 to 47.5 per cent in the 2016 referendum, although recent polls have suggested a swing towards remain. In Scotland, there was a strong majority \u0026ndash 62 to 38 per cent \u0026ndash to remain.  Setting out what he believes should happen  the Prime Minister secured a withdrawal agreement with Brussels, Mr Jones said: \"The next step is to see whether a deal can be supported by, for me, parliaments plural: Westminster, Edinburgh and Cardf.  \"If that doesn\u0027t happen, then I don\u0027t see any alternative other than a general election where Brexit would be the main issue.  \"If there\u0027s an inconclusive result as a result of that general election, well, how then do you resolve the issue without going back to the very same people who took the decision in the first place? At that point you are talking about the potential for a second referendum,\" added the AM for Bridgend.  His remarks came as battle-lines were being drawn ahead of this evening\u0026rsquos informal EU summit in Salzburg when Mrs May will seek to convince her fellow leaders of her Chequers Plan.  But ahead of it, Whitehall sources suggested that she had already rejected the \u0026ldquoimproved offer on the Irish border mooted by Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator.  One insider explained that Mr Barnier had still not dropped his view that Northern Ireland should be treated as a separate customs jurisdiction from the rest of the UK.  \u0026ldquoAny backstop will have to respect our red line that there is not a customs border in the Irish Sea. Mr Barnier has not said anything to suggest that his position has changed on that, said the source.  Nigel Dodds of the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May\u0027s minority administration in Parliament, gave Mr Barnier\u0027s proposals short shrt.  \"It still means a border down the Irish Sea although with dferent kinds of checks,\" said the party\u0027s deputy leader, adding: \u0026ldquoThe fact is that both Theresa May and the Labour Party have said no British prime minister could accept such a concept. It is not just Unionists who object.\"  Meanwhile, Donald Tusk made clear the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit plans needed to be \"reworked\".  Those positive areas included foreign and security policy co-operation, he explained.  But in a blow to Mrs May\u0027s approach, Mr Tusk noted: \"On other issues such as the Irish question or the framework for economic co-operation the UK\u0027s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.  He added that perhaps there was now \u0026ldquomore hope but there is surely less and less time\".  According to extracts released ahead of Mr Davis\u0027s speech, the former Cabinet minister will say: \"We have been told that the Chequers proposal fulfils what the British people voted for. Well, I am afraid I simply do not buy that.  \"Fty-two per cent of British voters oppose the proposals. Only 18 per cent approve. It is quite remarkable for a government policy to be that unpopular. And, for me, the Chequers plan was always a non-starter.  He noted how in her speeches at Lancaster House and at the Mansion House, the PM had promised to  control over the country\u0026rsquos laws, money and borders. These promises, he stressed, were in the Tory manesto too, yet the Chequers Plan crossed all of those red lines.  \"The EU is often correctly described as having a democratic deficit. But Chequers is devoid of democracy altogether.  \"This is why many of us will shortly be presenting an alternative plan which will outline a more ambitious vision.\"  Mr Davis will go on to say that German companies should not fear a more competitive UK outside the EU but, rather, should \"embrace the opportunity that it will create for German workers, families and businesses large and small\".  \"In the long run, the friendly economic competition between neighbours is massively beneficial.  \"Beneficial for the German companies whose supply chains will be provided with improved components from British factories, beneficial for the consumers of tomorrow, who will enjoy the fruits of a more competitive global economy, and beneficial for the students and entrepreneurs of all Europe,\" the Yorkshire MP will add."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-loses-vote-on-p1-assessments","story":"  Holyrood voted 63 to 61 to pause and review tests for P1 pupils, after complaints from teachers about them being of little value, and parents reporting\u0026nbspchildren in tears.  The SNP government has promoted the standardised national assessments as a key tool to gather information about P1 children\u0026rsquos abilities and to fine tune their teaching.  The vote is not binding on the government, but was a blow to Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos reputation as Education Secretary, and a sign the opposition could embed it in law at a later date.  The decision saw the Greens, Labour and LibDems line up with the Tories while only the SNP voted for a continuation of the computer-based literacy and numeracy tests.  The government defeat came just three months after Mr Swinney was forced to shelve his flagship Education Bill because teachers and other parties would not support the reforms.  The Tory-led manoeuvre followed an often bad-tempered debate in which Mr Swinney and other SNP MSPs accused the Conservatives of rank hypocrisy and political opportunism.  Ruth Davidson\u0026rsquos party had previously advocated standardised tests at P1 and endorsed the government\u0026rsquos use of them in its 2016 Holyrood manesto.  Tory education spokeswoman said her party had been wrong in the past.  \u0026ldquoWe made a mistake about P1, she said, adding her party remained in favour of assessments at P4, P7 and S3.  She told the Education Secretary: \u0026ldquoI think the time has come, because of the evidence that has been piling up over the last two years, to call a halt, reconsider the evidence that is very much before us and evaluate what is the best way of progressing P1 pupils.\"  Mr Swinney said he was \u0026ldquoappalled by the Conservative Party and accused it of \u0026ldquodeceit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Conservatives are playing politics with the education of our children and we will not play along \u0026nbspwith them.  He defended the assessments as an essential part of a good education system, an integral part of effective teaching and learning, and part of \u0026ldquonormal classwork that took little time.  After the vote, other parties demanded the SNP respect the will of parliament, something ministers have repeatedly told Westminster to do on constitutional issues.  Ms Smith said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has voted decisively on this matter, and now the SNP government must act on that. The nationalists have ignored the evidence on this for quite some time, but they can\u0026rsquot afford to any longer.  \u0026ldquoThese tests need to be halted, and the evidence re-examined. The SNP is always talking about how important the Scottish Parliament is and how its will must be respected.  \u0026ldquoThis is the perfect chance for the SNP to do just that.  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard used a point of order immediately after the vote to demand the government respect the outcome.  He said: \u0026ldquoTeachers told this government that these tests were useless, ministers ignored them. Parents told this government that they do not trust these tests, ministers ignored them.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has now voted to scrap these tests and SNP ministers must not now ignore the will of Parliament. The Government must therefore bring forward immediate plans for how it will respond to this evening\u0026rsquos vote as a matter of urgency.  Green education spokesman Ross Greer said: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos truly shocking about the introduction of these standardised tests is that all the issues highlighted by Greens and others were already well known when the SNP decided to press ahead.  \u0026ldquoMembers of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos own International Council of Education Experts have been at the forefront of these criticisms and ministers still cannot explain why they would ignore their own experts, never mind the voices of a majority of Scotland\u0026rsquos teachers.  \u0026ldquoNow a majority in the Scottish Parliament have joined the calls to scrap these tests for four and five year olds and in a fit of arrogance, the government seems set to ignore our decision.  \u0026ldquoThe concerns that Greens have raised are not limited to the P1 tests. The whole concept of standardised testing does more harm than good to our young people. John Swinney should follow the evidence, accept the will of parliament and scrap the tests immediately.  But SNP MSP Gordon MacDonald said all the opposition parties were \u0026ldquoguilty of the most appalling hypocrisy for siding with the Tories to score political points.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government introduced p1 assessments because they are a tool we need to track kids\u0026rsquo progress and help drive up standards in our schools.  \u0026ldquoThe Tories put standardised P1 assessments in their manesto the majority of Tory-run councils across Scotland already assessed kids from P1 so did Labour and the Lib Dems.  \u0026ldquoLabour and the Lib Dems have sided with the Tories in their political gamesmanship, and sought to prey on the anxieties of parents, just to grab a headline.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos depressing that they all stood willing to do so at the expense of kids\u0026rsquo education.  \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to educating our young people, we should be united in an ambition to drive up standards \u0026ndash not exploiting these issues for political gain.  Sue Palmer, chair of the educational charity Upstart, which promoted a boycott of the assessments, said: \u0026ldquoThe opposition parties made many cogent arguments against the P1 testing and it\u0026rsquos very disappointing that the Scottish government isn\u0026rsquot prepared to listen to them.  \u0026ldquoWe at Upstart Scotland are particularly pleased that one of the closing speeches against the tests mentioned the long-term implications of beginning testing at such an early age in terms of children\u0026rsquos social and emotional development. \u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThere is growing evidence that the decline of self-directed play  coupled with an early focus on teaching specic academic skills is helping to fuel mental health problems among children and young people.    \u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"new-details-of-45m-loan-to-firm-owned-by-fms-adviser","story":"  The Herald has learned the first \u0026pound15m tranche was given to Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde, because it was\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoexperiencing cash flow challenges.  The problem was caused by cost overruns on a \u0026pound97m government contract for two CalMac ferries which have been beset by delays.  Ferguson\u0026rsquos is part of the Clyde Blowers empire owned by Monaco-based Jim McColl, who sits on the First Minister\u0026rsquos Council of Economic Advisers.  Finance Secretary Derek Mackay learned of the cash flow issue in July 2017 and the loan was made last September, but he did not tell Holyrood\u0026rsquos finance committee until seven months later, when he sent a confidential letter referring to the trouble.  Until last week, there was no public record of the loan due to \u0026ldquocommercial confidentiality.  In June, Mr Mackay announced a further \u0026pound30m loan to Ferguson\u0026rsquos to help it \u0026ldquoersy. However records seen by the Herald cast doubt on whether this will ever be repaid.  The loan would not be repaid in a crisis until Ferguson\u0026rsquos insurance company, HCCI, was paid what it was owed first, as it is the first-ranked creditor.  Tory MSP Jamie Greene said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP have been anything but transparent. It took Derek Mackay over seven months to alert the Finance Committee about the first loan, and there are still huge question marks over the details.  \u0026ldquoHe then changed his story on what the money was for, saying that instead of ersication as first claimed, it was to plug a hole in the ferry contracts.  \u0026ldquoThis deal has been shrouded in secrecy. It\u0026rsquos not good enough for MSPs to go months in the dark - the SNP need to come clean and finally provide all the information surrounding these loans.

Opposition parties argue Mr Swinney must obey the will of parliament, but voting figures of 63 to 61 show how close the decision was.  It was exactly this ergence of opinion that Mr Swinney faced when he addressed an audience of educational professionals at the Scottish Learning Festival in Glasgow on the morning of the vote.  As Storm Ali began to make itself heard around the auditorium of the SEC Centre, the minister would have expected a buffeting on testing as the audience of teachers, heads and other educational professionals were invited to ask questions.  It did not start well. A teacher from a primary school in Galashiels, in the Scottish Borders, said her experience of P1 testing was that they were not working.  \u0026ldquoThey are actually a huge waste of time and money in the way they are being enforced in primary schools, she said.  \u0026ldquoIt is not that I have an objection in principle to the idea of standardised assessments, but what I am seeing in practice is that they don\u0026rsquot work, they are not suitable and my colleagues around me feel exactly the same way.  \u0026ldquoThere is a widespread feeling in Scottish primary schools that they are not fit for purpose.  As Mr Swinney scribbled hastily into his notebook in preparation for a dficult answer, a headteacher from another primary school came to his rescue.  \u0026ldquoWe did not find any level of stress at all and the primary one children actually quite enjoyed taking part, she said.  \u0026ldquoIn terms of the feedback we found them to be extremely helpful. We had a small group of boys that I think we had the wrong measure of when it came down to teacher judgement and it changed how we looked at the support they needed. I think we had underestimated them.  \u0026ldquoThe depth of feedback and the quality of feedback the assessments gave us really helped those children.  Mr Swinney said the contrasting remarks illustrated the ergence of opinion on the benefits of the assessments for five-year-olds.  But what he was at pains to stress to the audience was his belief in the quality of feedback they could provide.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat literally drew an intake of breath from a group of teachers who went through the assessments with me was when they saw the diagnostic information and the way it was presented.  \u0026ldquoIt marshalled some of the strengths and the challenges that young people face and the purpose of standardised assessments is to make sure we are able to learn from what the experience of young people has been, what their challenges are and then to do something about it.  \u0026ldquoThe attainment gap exists when young people come into formal education and the challenge is to try and narrow that as quickly as we possibly can which is why I take the view that P1 assessments are helpful in that respect.  Lurking in the audience to hijack the Education Secretary further on assessments was Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union.  Mr Flanagan, whose union has backed a campaign to encourage parents to opt out of P1 testing, raised the issue of councils who blanket test pupils, rather than allowing inidual teachers to decide - a phenomenon blamed for greater levels of pupil stress.  Mr Flanagan said: \u0026ldquoA set of guidelines was produced, one of which was that teachers would control when these assessments were done.  \u0026ldquoWe know that 25 out of 32 local authorities breached that guideline and instructed teachers when to carry out the assessments.  With a nod to his past as a secondary school English teacher, Mr Flanagan then drew on the words of Hamlet to ask: \u0026ldquoSo in terms of empowerment, there\u0026rsquos the rub. How do we turn rhetoric around professional autonomy into a reality?  Mr Swinney conceded that he did not agree with Mr Flanagan on many things, and also expressed mock surprise the union leader had not taken the opportunity to raise the ongoing issue of pay.  But Mr Flanagan did get a concession from the minister on the need to ensure the guidance was being followed.  Mr Swinney said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot always say this, but I agree with Larry Flanagan. The guidance is clear that teachers should choose at what point it is appropriate to undertake the assessments and that should be respected and I will pursue that in my discussion with local authorities."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-tells-eu-leaders-in-salzburg-chequers-is-only-credible-plan-on-the-table","story":"  As the Prime Minister promoted her compromise proposals over dinner with fellow European leaders at an informal summit in Salzburg, Carwyn Jones, the Welsh First Minister, intervened, arguing that  Holyrood and Cardf were to oppose the final Brexit deal, then there should be a general election, which could eventually lead to another EU referendum.  \"The next step is to see whether a deal can be supported by, for me, parliaments plural: Westminster Edinburgh and Cardf.

Before the Salzburg dinner began at the Felsenreitschule - the theatre made famous by the von Trapp family in the film The Sound of Music \u0026ndash Mrs May insisted her Brexit blueprint was \"the only credible and negotiable plan on the table that delivers no hard border in Northern Ireland and also delivers on the vote of the British people\".  She stressed: \"If we are going to achieve a successful conclusion then, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to evolve its position too.\"  But ahead of the dinner Donald Tusk, the European Council President, made clear the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit plans needed to be \"reworked\".  Announcing a special EU summit in mid-November \u0026ndash which will set the scene for signing any Brexit agreement \u0026ndash Mr Tusk said that while there was \u0026ldquomore hope a deal would be done, there was \u0026ldquoless time in which to do it.

But Whitehall sources made clear that the private suggestions about Brussels\u0027s new proposals were unacceptable as they still did not drop the view that Northern Ireland could be treated as a separate customs jurisdiction from the rest of the UK.  Mrs May stressed: \u0026ldquoWhat we cannot accept is seeing Northern Ireland carved away from the UK customs territory because, regardless of where the checks would be, what that would mean would be that it would be a challenge to our constitutional and economic integrity.\"  She also decried \u0026ldquoprominent Labour members like the Mayor of London, who were now trying to take Britain \u0026ldquoback to square one with support for a People\u0026rsquos Vote on Brexit.  \"I want to be absolutely clear, this government will never accept a second referendum, declared the PM, adding: \"We held a People\u0027s Vote it was the referendum in 2016.  \u0026ldquoPeople voted to leave the European Union, it is now a matter of trust in politicians that we should deliver on the vote of the British people,\" she added.

The intervention by the former Holyrood Presiding Office came after a People\u0027s Vote report, written by fellow Scottish peer Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who authored Article 50, suggested Mrs May could be forced to concede a second referendum by a vote of MPs or that she could even decide to call one herself.

It is fair to say that much of the cultural world is viewing Brexit with, as with the majority of Scots, alarm, consternation and dismay.  Mr Wood and Mr Bartlam, who are successful venue operators at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, know this.

Ms Sturgeon has written to opposition leaders in London, arguing that  the UK failed to agree a deal with the EU, the timetable for talks must be extended.  The SNP leader said: \"It\u0027s time for everyone in the UK political establishment to wake up to the reality of what now faces us.  \"If the choice we face is between no-deal and no detail, then an extension to the Article 50 negotiation period must be on the table as the only way to avoid an economic clf edge, and allow all alternative options to be considered.\"  At a dinner with fellow European leaders in Salzburg, Austria, on Wednesday night, Mrs May continued to argue her Chequers proposals were the only credible route to a deal.  The PM\u0027s message was that while the time for an agreement to be reached was now short, \"delaying or extending these negotiations is not an option\", according to a senior UK official.  Mrs May has been adamant that there will be no second referendum on Brexit nor any extension to Article 50 ie Britain will leave the EU on March 29 next year.  But the FM insisted it \"seems increasingly likely\" that the statement setting out the future relationship between the UK and the EU \"will be vague and lacking in meaningful detail\".  \"The Tory Government has been busy trying to paint Brexit as a choice between a no-deal Brexit and the inadequate Chequers proposal, but in reality that is a false dichotomy thanks to their incompetence, infighting and indecision, it seems increasingly likely that the choice will be between a no-deal Brexit and a blind Brexit.  \"Both options are unpalatable and completely unacceptable, declared Ms Sturgeon.  \"A no-deal Brexit will, by the UK Government\u0027s own admission, lead to dire economic consequences and a shortage of medicines and foodstuffs.  \"Meanwhile, a blind Brexit will simply kick all of the dficult decisions into the long grass - but with the UK already out of the EU.  \"Not only would that continue the uncertainty, it would be tantamount to stepping off a clf edge blindfolded, with no idea of what the landing place will be.\"  Ms Sturgeon added: \"Even at this late stage, Theresa May can escape the corner into which she has boxed herself. For two years, the Scottish Government and many others have been telling the Prime Minister that by far the least damaging Brexit option would be to remain in the single market and customs union it is time for her to listen.\""},{"url":null,"title":"kim-jong-un-wants-nuclear-talks-with-us","story":"  Mr Kim also hopes for a quick follow-up to his June summit with Donald Trump and that a formal end to the Korean War can be agreed, his southern counterpart revealed.  Mr Moon told reporters in Seoul that he will carry a private message from Mr Kim for Mr Trump on the nuclear standoff when he meets with the US president in New York next week on the sidelines of the UN general assembly session.  Both Mr Trump, who has repeatedly spoken of his good relationship with Kim, and the North Korean leader have expressed a desire to meet again, but there are worries among observers about whether Mr Kim is as committed to denuclearisation as he claims.  Mr Moon faces increasing pressure from Washington to find a path forward in efforts to get Mr Kim to completely, and unilaterally, abandon his nuclear arsenal.  \"There are things that the United States wants us to convey to North Korea, and on the other side there are also things that North Korea wants us to convey to the United States,\" Mr Moon said at a press centre in Seoul where reporters watched parts of his summit with Mr Kim on video huge screens that occasionally showed live streams from Pyongyang.  \"I will faithfully serve that role when I meet President Trump to facilitate dialogue between North Korea and the United States.\"  Mr Moon, who set up the June summit in Singapore between Mr Trump and Mr Kim and is eager for another to happen, also told reporters that he will convey to Mr Trump his and Mr Kim\u0027s desire to get a declaration on ending the Korean War by the end of this year.  The war still technically continues because it ended with a ceasefire, not a peace treaty.  Such a declaration would be the first step toward a formal peace treaty, but many in the United States are worried that it could result in Mr Kim pushing for the removal of US troops stationed in South Korea to deter the North.  Earlier Thursday, Mr Kim and Mr Moon took to the road for the final day of their summit, hiking to the peak of Mount Paektu, which is considered sacred in the North, their hands clasped and raised in a pose of triumph.  Their trip to the mountain on the North Korean-Chinese border, and the striking photo-op that will resonate in both Koreas, followed a day of wide-ranging agreements on Wednesday they trumpeted as a major step toward peace.  However, their premier accord on the issue that most worries the world, the North\u0027s pursuit of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of striking as far as the US mainland, contained a big condition: Kim stated that he would permanently dismantle North Korea\u0027s main nuclear facility only  the United States takes unspecied corresponding measures.  Photos showed the leaders smiling broadly as they posed at the summit of Paektu, their wives grinning at their sides, a brilliant blue sky and the deep crater lake that tops the volcano in the background.  They also toured the shores of the lake, and Mr Moon and his we filled bottles with its water.  Members of the Kim family are referred to as sharing the Paektu bloodline, and the volcano is emblazoned on North Korea\u0027s national emblem and lends its name to everything from rockets to power stations.  Many South Koreans also feel drawn to the volcano, which, according to Korean mythology, was the birthplace of Dangun, the founder of the first ancient Korean kingdom, and has long been considered one of the most beautul places on the peninsula.  Not everyone was pleased, though.  About 100 anti-North Korea protesters rallied in central Seoul to express anger about the summit and displayed slogans that read, No To SK-NK Summit That Benefits Kim Jong Un.  The leaders are basking in the glow of the joint statement they signed on Wednesday.  Compared to the vague language of their two earlier summits, Mr Kim and Mr Moon seem to have agreed on an ambitious programme meant to tackle soaring tensions that caused many to fear war last year as the North tested a string of increasingly powerful weapons.  Mr Kim promised to accept international inspectors to monitor the closing of a key missile test site and launch pad and to visit Seoul soon, and both leaders vowed to work together to try to host the Summer Olympics in 2032.  But while containing several tantalising offers, their joint statement appeared to fall short of the major steps many in Washington have been looking for - such as a commitment by Kim to provide a list of North Korea\u0027s nuclear facilities, a solid step-by-step timeline for closing them down, or an agreement to allow international inspectors to assess progress or discover violations.  It also was unclear what \"corresponding steps\" North Korea wants from the US to dismantle its nuclear site.  The question is whether it will be enough for Mr Trump to pick up where Mr Moon has left off.  Mr Trump told reporters on Wednesday that the outcome of the summit was \"very good news\" and that \"we\u0027re making tremendous progress\" with North Korea.  He did not indicate in his brief remarks whether the US would be willing to take further steps to encourage North Korean action on denuclearisation.  \"We have agreed to make the Korean Peninsula a land of peace that is free from nuclear weapons and nuclear threat,\" Mr Kim said on Wednesday as the two leaders announced their agreement.  \"The road to our future will not always be smooth and we may face challenges and trials we can\u0027t anticipate.  \"But we aren\u0027t afraid of headwinds because our strength will grow as we overcome each trial based on the strength of our nation.\"  Mr Moon urged unity for all Koreans in a speech he gave Wednesday night to the crowd gathered for North Korea\u0027s signature mass games.  He said: \"I now propose that we completely eliminate the hostility of the past 70 years and take a big step forward in peace so that we can become one again.\"  According to a statement signed by the countries\u0027 defence chiefs, the two Koreas agreed to establish buffer zones along their land and sea borders to reduce military tensions and prevent accidental clashes.  They also agreed to withdraw 11 guard posts from the Demilitarised Zone by December and to establish a no-fly zone above the military demarcation line that bisects the two Koreas that will apply to planes, helicopters and drones.  Other agreements aimed at removing some longstanding irritants from their relations, such as allowing more contact between families ided by the Korean War.  Mr Moon also appeared to be making good on his proposals to help build up the North\u0027s infrastructure and open cross-border rail links."},{"url":null,"title":"bennachie campaign to be discussed at holyrood","story":"        The Save Bennachie Alliance will head to the Scottish Parliament this week to discuss its campaign.

When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo  only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in Scotland.Copies of both the workbooks and storybooks are available at John O\u0026rsquoGroats and Caithness Horizons.\u0026nbspThursday 20 Sep 2018 4:37

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 4:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso.

However, Ms Oag believes it is leading to a surge in the number of abandoned and ill-treated animals.\"It\u0027s not fair on them to be sold alongside kids\u0027 bikes and unused furniture,\" she said. \"Too many people are just not taking responsibility. They like the look of the dog when it\u0027s a puppy and then they take it home and think, \u0027I can\u0027t be bothered with it.\u0027\"A Scottish SPCA spokesman said people should re-home a rescue pet, rather than buy online, while a Gumtree spokesman insisted it had taken steps to safeguard animals by introducing the fee.Meanwhile, a Preloved spokeswoman stressed that although sellers existed that don\u0027t have an animal\u0027s best interests at heart, they are in the minority.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 4:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Students get on their bikes in memory of friend","story":"THREE students got on their bikes at John O\u0026rsquoGroats earlier this week and pointed their compasses to Land\u0026rsquos End in a bid to raise awareness about mental health.Fenn Newsome, Giles Themans and Alex Hayton decided upon the marathon pedal following the death of their friend and fellow Newcastle University student, Marcus Colville.Marcus, from Exeter, had tragically taken his own le last December. He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusThursday 20 Sep 2018 4:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 20, 2018 at 2:31 pmHM Coastguard have given the following update on this afternoon\u0026#8217s situation near The Gloup, Deerness.

While this may not achieve the same speeds as some other options, it may at least offer the benefit of a solution in the nearer future.“I welcome the fact that BT has agreed to investigate the practicalities of installing radio links and hope that this can play a part in helping deliver the improved broadband services that communities across Orkney desperately need to see.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 4:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The findings from these will be fed into the on-going options investigation study, which is expected to report in the autumn of 2018 on ways to improve the junctions to help reduce the risk of accidents.\"Road safety is a priority for the Scottish Government and we understand the concerns of the community. We have undertaken to update stakeholders on progress and would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that the A9 at Tain remains a trunk road safety priority.\"In 2015 Transport Scotland\u0026rsquos operating company for the region, Bear, carried out a number of works on the A9 at the Tain north junction, including new signing, extended central hatching and high friction surfacing on the local road approach to the A9.Have you been involved in an accident or near miss in the area?

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.\nFrom photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the 12th July, is a big male known as 014 or “Bigga”.  Next day, the same inidual was identied at 0800hrs heading north through Yell Sound.\nSome of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.\nCommon heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.\nChanging colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.\nFrom the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with 14 women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday.\n issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north.

partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards

the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a

have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished

We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

many women are being left traumatised by these implants","story":"\nA Banbridge woman who suffered 12 years of pain after having a vaginal mesh implant fitted is leading the fight for a moratorium on the use of the devices in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nDrawing on her own painful experience, Jackie Harvey has set up an online support group to offer help and advice to local women about mesh implants, and raise awareness about the complications associated with them.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJackie Harvey.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe implants are used by surgeons in an operation to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, which can be common after childbirth. But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help?

Despite the Troubles shutting down parts of the city, he is determined to play his headline slot in the Harp Bar even  it means playing to an audience of one. It’s here that Terri meets his we Ruth, played by West End star Niamh Perry, and the two try to build their le together, as Terri becomes distracted – all too easily – by trying to passionately promote the latest band to come on the punk scene as he turns promoter for Rudi and The Outcasts.\nIf anyone during Sunday’s afternoon matinee was expecting a leisurely retrospective they were in for a rude awakening as this is a gloriously full-on production of music and song with all-star cast in full, fine voice, all playing instruments and giving it the heap.\nEvery audience member is with our protagonist as he goes across the water, copious copies of seven-inch vinyl under his arm as he tries, most of the time in vain, to try and get snooty English music executives to listen to a band from Derry called The Undertones and their debut song Teenage Kicks – a song so iconic that John Peel did the unthinkable and played it twice on Radio One.\nWith every high comes the inevitable low and we witness how Terri releases the band from the Good Vibrations label for “£500 and a signed copy of a Shangri-Las record”.\nWith a marriage falling apart, mounting debts at the record shop and next to no revenue, a fundraising concert at the Ulster Hall sets the scene for the rousing finale and our lead’s poignant rendition of Sonny Bono’s Laugh At Me.\nA standing ovation gave way to the ‘national anthem’ as the raw opening bars of Teenage Kicks started up and the audience sang every line back to the cast.\nGood Vibrations is a must-see – simple as that. The amount of energy fizzing off the stage is infectious and the cast of ten are exceptional. A transfer to the West End must surely follow.\n\n\nGood Vibrations runs at the Lyric Theatre until Saturday, October 6.

Fourteen of the papers lodged were deemed void or rejected for uncertainty.\n\nTen percent of the North Antrim electorate was required. That was 7,543 voters.\n\nThe DUP spokesperson confirmed that the party investigation into Mr Paisley\u0027s conduct had now finished.\n\n\"Mr Ian Paisley MP was suspended from membership of the party on 24th July 2018, by the Party Officers, following publication of the report of the House of Commons Committee on Standards and pending further investigation into his conduct,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"The internal processes surrounding these matters have been completed. On Tuesday 18th September Mr Paisley was readmitted to membership of the party following a suspension of fty-seven days and upon re-admission he is subject to a number of conditions including a ban on holding office within the party for twelve months.\n\n\"The Party will be making no further comment on these matters.\"\n\nIan Paisley said he was delighted by the \"unwavering support\" of his constituents.\n\nSpeaking to the Press Association in Ballymena, Mr Paisley said: \"I was asked to make an apology, I gave that apology, and I believe that 90.6% of the electorate who had the opportunity to say we don\u0027t accept that apology, I believe they said we do accept that apology, and we are prepared to move on.\n\n\"I must say I am delighted with that, delighted with the unwavering support I have received from my constituents, hopefully now we can move on and get on with the real job I am elected to do.\"\n\nMr Paisley also confirmed he has made complaints to the PSNI about three people over allegations they broke the electoral law.\n\n\"A number of people have breached section 124 of the election law and I have raised at least three specic complaints about iniduals with police,\" he said.\n\n\"It\u0027s up to police now to take that forward. I know  I had breached the law in that way, the same people would be asking questions.\"\n\nSinn Fein Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill slammed the DUP for not sacking Mr Paisley.\n\nShe said: \"He displayed a gross lack of integrity in public office through these actions. Despite this, there was no hint of an apology from the DUP to either the people of North Antrim or the Tamil population.\n\n“Instead, he has been welcomed back into the DUP fold.\n\n“That represents another failure on behalf of the DUP and is an effective endorsement of his actions.\n\n“The DUP is very fond of ponticating to others but when it came to dealing with its own wrongdoing, it failed to take the appropriate action, which would have been to sack Ian Paisley.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37336383.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/pe_00560532.jpg","title":"hallelujah ian paisley survives recall petition to remain north antrim mp","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Instead, he has been welcomed back into the DUP fold.\n\n“That represents another failure on behalf of the DUP and is an effective endorsement of his actions.\n\n“The DUP failed to take the appropriate action, which would have been to sack Ian Paisley.”\n\nSpeaking to the Press Association in Ballymena on Thursday morning, Mr Paisley said he wants to move on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Antrim MP Ian Paisley in Ballymena as he has kept his seat after a recall petition failed to attract enough signatures.\n\n\n\n\n“I was asked to make an apology, I gave that apology, and I believe that 90.6% of the electorate who had the opportunity to say ‘we don’t accept that apology’, I believe they said ‘we do accept that apology, and we are prepared to move on’,” he said.\n\n“I must say I am delighted with that, delighted with the unwavering support I have received from my constituents. Hopefully now we can move on and get on with the real job I am elected to do.”\n\nMr Paisley said he felt “humbled and privileged” and also hailed his family and “true friends” for sticking by him.\n\nHe also revealed he has made three complaints to police over allegations electoral law was broken over the failed recall petition.\n\nThere are rules over what can be said or published during the six weeks the petition is open, which  broken can carry potential fines and prison terms.\n\nNorthern Ireland’s chief electoral officer Virginia McVea has already warned Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan over a video he posted to social media.\n\nMr Paisley said: “A number of people have breached section 124 of the election law and I have raised at least three specic complaints about iniduals with police.\n\n“It’s up to police now to take that forward. I know  I had breached the law in that way, the same people would be asking questions.”\n\nMr Paisley would have been ousted as an MP  10% of the electorate in his constituency – 7,543 voters – signed the petition. In the event, 7,099 people signed it .\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Mr McGuigan said he found the warning from Ms McVea “incredible”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSinn Fein’s Philip McGuigan.\n\n\n\n\nHe said: “I do not believe there was anything in the post that predicted the outcome of the petition.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic widespread road closures in wake of storm ali","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The game went ahead at Windsor Park.\n\nThe party has also called for a boycott of the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest which will take place in Israel.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"irelands foreign minister calls for brexit deal talks to be ramped up","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There is an onus on all involved in these negotiations to find a way through.\n\n“We need to try and finalise a withdrawal treaty that is a legal document which is, to quote Michel Barnier, 87% completed but the remaining 12 or 13% involves Irish issues and the most dficult is the Irish backstop commitment in terms of following through in that.”\n\nMr Coveney made the comments as he unveiled a campaign to help Irish businesses prepare for Brexit, despite not knowing the details of any deal.\n\nA number of workshops will be held across Ireland next month in a bid to provide a “one-stop-shop” for people and businesses ahead of Britain leaving the EU next March.\n\nEnterprise Minister Heather Humphreys said that Brexit was the “most signicant challenge” facing Irish enterprise in over 50 years.\n\n“While there is still uncertainty of what Brexit will look like, there is no doubt it will involve signicant change in the trading environment and in how we do business,” she said.\n\n“Ireland traded its way out of challenging times before and we will do so again.\n\n“Preparation is key. We are at the frontline in supporting and encouraging business to prepare for Brexit.”\n\nShe said that 85% of businesses were taking Brexit-related action, but she has called for all firms to prepare for Brexit.\n\nMichael Creed, Minister for Agriculture, said he had met with representatives from the agri-food industry in Northern Ireland as well as representatives from the Ulster Farmers’ Union.\n\n“Obviously the absence of an Executive is a problem in terms of having that voice heard loud and clear in the context of the debate,” he said.\n\n“Most people realise there are consequences of a bad outcome of the negotiations for the day-to-day business operations, so I think increasingly that voice is being heard and that’s important.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watchdog calls for transparency over irish presidential spending","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

chairman of the Public Accounts Committee  says it is important that information about presidential spending be released before the election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe PAC has decided to examine the expenditure related to the Office of the President next week, in defiance of the state’s top civil servant.\n\nPAC Chairman, Fianna Fail TD Sean Fleming said on Thursday that people should be able to draw their own conclusions before they vote.\n\n\n\nI think its important that the information be put out before people go to vote and make their own judgment\nSean Fleming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n“It will be a bit like what we learn under Freedom of Information  Act, that way the information will be out there and the public can make their own conclusion.\n\n“I think its important that the information be put out before people go to vote and make their own judgment.”\n\nMr Fleming added that  the examination did not go ahead, it could cause members of the public to cast aspersions on the expenditure, which could be damaging to the Office of the President.\n\nThe PAC plan for the meeting to take place next Tuesday, a day before the Presidential election campaign officially kicks off.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nPresident Michael D Higgins is seeking re-election \n\n\n\n\nAt the meeting of the committee on Thursday TDs debated at  about the probe going ahead amid an election campaign.\n\nHowever, Mr Fleming, stated that the committee doesn’t stop working during an election.\n\nThe majority of committee members agreed in a vote that the meeting to examine the expenses should go ahead.\n\nThe State’s top civil servant, secretary general to the government Martin Fraser, has already written to the committee that such a meeting could be “unconstitutional” and could be seen as political interference.\n\nHe  also questioned why the committee is only now scrutinising presidential spending, seven years after Michael D Higgins was elected.\n\n“Given that we’re now in the middle of an election I think the Public Accounts Committee, in my view, should desist and in the coolness of the aftermath of an election,” he said.\n\nAs the accounting officer for the President’s office is the Secretary General to the Government, Mr Fraser would be required to appear before the committee.\n\nMr Fleming confirmed Mr Fraser will be asked to account for how and where money was spent, but will not be able to answer why or who made the decisions.\n\nNo questions about the President himself will be permitted.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nMichael D Higgins at the National Ploughing Championships \n\n\n\n\nLabour’s Alan Kelly raised concerns that no matter how well the committee is chaired what’s said in committee could be detrimental to Mr Higgins’ re-election campaign.\n\n“The fact is there is campaign going on live at the moment, in the committee next week comments will be made and you can’t unsay what is said, and it will have political consequences be it positive or negative for any candidate.”\n\nMr Kelly’s request that the committee ask for legal advice before going ahead with the meeting was rejected.\n\nA recent analysis of spending connected to the Presidential Office during Michael D Higgins’ time at the helm showed spending of more than 55m euro between Aras an Uachtarain and other State agencies like the Office of Public Works and the Department of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThere have been unconfirmed reports that President Michael D Higgins stayed in luxury Geneva hotel, the Beau-Rivage, when he visited the city to address the International Labour Organisation.\n\nThe issue was first raised by Independent Senator Gerard Craughwell who said he had received information that Mr Higgins stayed at the hotel, where suites are advertised for euro3,000 a night over the summer.\n\nMr Fleming confirmed that the committee had received several requests to examine the President’s expenses.\n\nRecords relating to the presidency are exempt from Freedom of Information  laws.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"storm bronagh set to batter parts of the uk and ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Renvyle Post Office and Castle House B\u0026B being buffeted by the storm. \n\nWith the building’s owner away on holiday, neighbour Liam Diamond thought quickly and called local plant hire firm Graham Heanue, who arrived swtly with an excavator and secured the roof with its bucket.\n\n\nNeighbours to the rescue, managed to prevent the roof from blowing off and onto a busy street where it would have surely caused accidents and injuries. \n#StormAli\n \n@MetEireann\n \n@IanDempsey\n \n@joeliveline\n \n@NewstalkFM\n \n@rtenews\n \n@HenryMcKean\n \n@Galwaybayfmnews\n \npic.twitter/QELt5sL7cm\n\n— Diego  \nSeptember 19, 2018\n\n\n\n\nLiam’s daughter Priscilla Diamond, who filmed the incident, warned the roof could have caused injuries had it blown off. \n\n“To the front of that building is the main road, it was busy with children going to school, people going to work and customers using the post office,” Priscilla told the Press Association. \n\n“It was not going to last much longer and could have caused injuries or accidents  left to fly away.”\n\nPriscilla’s brother Diego Diamond said the bucket was still holding the roof in place a day later, but that a builder has arrived to temporarily secure it.\n\n“I was fearful that some auld buck would park up in front and the roof would land on them,” the 32-year-old local business owner said. \n\n“We’re just neighbours and for public safety more than anything we took action to prevent possible fatalities.”\n\nA second named storm, Bronagh, is set to batter parts of the UK and Ireland over the coming days, with more strong winds expected. \n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiego said he would like people to take some messages away from the video from Galway.\n\n“Take heed of weather warnings, tie down anything that could possibly cause damage , don’t leave loose s*** out around the house,” he said.\n\n“We were nearly hit by a few flying missiles while trying to prevent the roof from going.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch peta is saving the pets that were left behind after hurricane florence","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

It\u0027s about the lives of ordinary people - people who live day to day with the realities which politics imposes.\n\n\"We are in London asking for help to wake up those with power to the realities of the human cost of Brexit borders.\"\n\nThe group is opposed to any borders on the island of Ireland or down the Irish Sea and represents a cross-section of the community in the city who are becoming increasingly anxious that the voices of people from Northern Ireland are not being heard at the Brexit negotiating table.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThey will call on political leaders to ensure that the fears and concerns of all peoples are heard, and that an agreement at the EU Autumn Summit will ensure no hard borders are imposed after Brexit takes effect.\n\nMs McCamphill added: “We hear a lot of rhetoric and promises that there will be no hard border. In spite of that we have been given no cast iron solutions. We cannot be expected to just allow people to put their lives on hold and wait worrying about their futures.\n\n“For a long time we have been able to move freely from Derry to Donegal, Armagh to Louth, Belfast to Edinburgh, London to Dublin and so on. A hard border in the Irish Sea or in Ireland will impact on everyone’s freedom and the increasingly good relations that we have been fostering across these islands.\n\n“Derry Girls Against Borders want to empower the people who will be affected and we are not prepared to sit back in the hope that a solution will be reached. The impact of Brexit borders on our lives is much bigger than trade and economics. It’s about the emotional, psychological impact also and the signicant challenges any change will pose to our way of le. Where we come from things are complex, they are delicate and they require thoughtfulness. That thoughtfulness requires engagement and it requires listening to those who will be affected. \n\n“The freedoms and flexibilities we currently have protect our way of le, they protect the shared sense of belonging people right across our communities have. We do not believe that those concerns are part of the debate yet and they must be in order to achieve a satisfactory solution.\n\n“All we are asking is to be heard - and for those right across these islands to help us be heard. You don’t have to be from Derry - or be a girl - you just have to care. Help us, make them listen and stop Brexit borders.”\n\nTo sign the Derry Girls Against Borders petition on change.org, click here: \nhttps:www.change.org/p/dublin-london-belfast-and-brussels-hear-our-voices-and-stop-brexit-borders\n\nTo follow the campaign on social media: Twitter: @DerryGirlsAB Facebook: \nwww.facebook/DerryGirls\n Instagram: @derrygirlsagainstborders\n\n\nPictured above: A cross section of those who have shared their stories with Derry Girls Against Borders on how a Brexit border here will adversely affect their lives.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry mp welcomes commencement a6 drumahoe dungiven","story":"\nSinn Féin MP Elisha McCallion has welcomed confirmation that work on the Drumahoe to Dungiven section of the A6 road upgrade will officially begin next Wednesday.\n\nThe Foyle MP said: \"News that the A6 dualling scheme between Drumahoe and Dungiven is set to begin next week is a positive step forward for the city. \n\n\"Work is already well underway on other sections of the A6 and when completed, this road upgrade will reduce journey times between Derry and Belfast which is vital for growing our economy and increasing connectivity.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n\"It will also make it much easier for visitors and tourists to travel to the city. \n\n\"This has been made possible because of the work to take this vital infrastructure project forward carried out by Chris Hazzard as Infrastructure Minister. \n\n\"This, along with other key infrastructure projects such as the A5 and the transport hub at the old Waterside train station, will all enhance this city and district for locals and others.\" \n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public urged stay safe high winds heavy showers continue","story":"\nA local councillor has urged people to take all necessary precautions as the stormy weather continues.\n\nSinn Féin Councillor Kevin Campbell  has advised the Derry public to heed the current amber weather warning issued by the Met Office.\n\nIt comes after trees and hoardings and roof tiles have blown down across the city.\n\n\"I would urge caution as driving conditions will be dangerous at times and rail, air and ferry services may be affected.  There is also the possibility of longer journey times and cancellations are possible,\" he said.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“All road users should take extra care of loose debris and be mindful that tree falls and some structural damage are possible.\n\n“Power cuts may occur, and I would advise members of the public to report any damage to poles or electricity lines immediately and to stay clear.\n\n“People should keep informed about the weather and act to protect yourself and your home from the effects of flooding and high winds, and importantly to heed safety warnings.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor derrys family fun day take place weekend","story":"\nBrooke Park is the place to be this weekend as the Mayor invites local children along for some family fun.\n\nThe event is taking place this Saturday September 22, from 2pm – 5pm, with all donations in aid of the Mayor’s chosen charity, Foyle Search and Rescue.\n\nAnnouncing the event, the Mayor, Councillor John Boyle, said he was delighted to be hosting the event in the beautul grounds of the recently regenerated park.\n\n“Brooke Park has undergone a major transformation and recently the extensive work which has gone into the project has been recognised with a second Green Flag award.

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch woman’s invite to join charity Twilight Walk  ","story":"\t\t\t\nBALLYNAHINCH woman Rosalind Steenson is urging people to join her on the forthcoming Marie Curie Twilight Walk to raise funds for the leading cancer charity.\n\nThe event \u0026mdash which takes place on Friday, September 28 at 7.30pm \u0026mdash will be held in the beautul grounds of Barnett Demesne in South Belfast to raise funds for an organisation which provides care to people with a terminal illness in their own homes or in one of its nine hospices.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe charity is also a leader in research into the best ways of caring for people with a terminal illness and all the\u0026nbsp\n\nservices it provides are free of charge, with around 70% of its income coming via donations with the balance of funds provided by the NHS.\n\nThose taking part in the forthcoming Twilight Walk can expect much more than just a walk as there will be a festival atmosphere with music, entertainment and a spectacular firework display to finish off.\n\nPeople take part in the walk for all sorts of reasons, with a large proportion walking in memory of someone they have lost.\u0026nbsp\n\nRosalind will be remembering her best friend of over 30 years, Michelle Watterson, who died in the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in July.\n\n\u0026ldquoMichelle was diagnosed with cancer for the second time three years ago and, unfortunately, it spread to other parts of her body and became terminal, she explained.\n\n\u0026ldquoShe spent her final ten days at the hospice where she received exceptional care.

Even  you start out walking by yourself, you are never alone along the Camino.\n\nThe Camino Portugues, or the Portuguese Way, spans from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela, the final destination being St James\u0026rsquo Church, where the body of St James is said to lay.\n\nIt travels through the province of Galicia in northern Spain, going through the cities of Porto and Pontevedra and along the coastline of Sanxenxo, the Cies Islands, and Baiona.\n\nWhile this Camino way was shorter that the more arduous Camino Del Norte throughout the northern Basque area of Spain, Edmund said that there were other challenges.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest challenge was walking in extreme heat, said Edmund. \u0026ldquoIt was 38 degrees on one day but for the rest of the days it was around 28 degrees. Staying hydrated was also a challenge.\n\nEdmund also enjoys the feeling of having to travel from one hostel to another with just the bare basics, as he says it gives him an understanding of what le is like for those with transitory lestyles.\n\nHowever, he adds: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a great togetherness and camaraderie as everyone is doing it together.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"First look inside new £16m Down Leisure Centre with ‘wow factor’  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE new \u0026pound16m Down Leisure Centre, which opens its doors to the public in November, has the wow factor those closely involved in its design always promised it would have.\n\nWhile very much a community facility, the ultra-modern and futuristic three-storey building boasts a stunning range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.\n\nWhile the finishing touches are being put to the 6,500 square metre, three-storey Market Street building, the Down Recorder was last week given a sneak preview of the stunning new centre that has been a long time coming.\u0026nbsp\n\nPlans for the new complex were first discussed well over a decade ago and despite raised eyebrows about building the centre in front of the ageing facility it will replace, everything has gone smoothly with council officials delighted they now have a leisure complex that will be the envy of many.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are confident that once the centre opens its doors to the public, people will recognise the long wait for a new leisure complex has been worth it, with the new vitality suite on the top floor which boasts a sauna, steam room and small pool with its own mini fountain, particularly stunning.\n\nThe spacious and airy entrance foyer opens up to reveal two swimming pools, one of which has a moveable floor. There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees. Organised by a newly named community group \u0026mdash Lecale Training Workshops Ltd \u0026mdash the scheme will cater for young people between the ages of 16 and 19.\n\nLatest unemployment figures put the total number out of work in that age group in Down district at almost 500. The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday. He was 19 year-old Andrew Stephen Martin, of Ascot Park in Belfast.\n\nMr Martin was involved in a head-on collision with a car at a spot known as the Rectory on the Ballykinlar-Clough Road. The accident happened at approximately 2pm and Mr Martin died about two hours later in Downe Hospital.\n\nThe driver of the car, who was a soldier based at Ballykinlar camp, was taken to the Downe, but was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast suffering from severe facial injuries.\n\nMr Frank Greeves, a local lorry driver, told the Recorder that it one of the most dangerous bends he had ever seen. He asked: \u0026ldquoHow many more lives have to be lost before something is done?\n\nA DoE spokesman said there were no plans to carry out work on the road.\n\nSTRANGFORD \u0026mdash A party of 130 mentally and physically handicapped children and young adults went cruising on Strangford Lough free of charge on Tuesday \u0026mdash courtesy of the Downpatrick Division of the DoE Roads Service.\n\nThe group\u0026rsquo aged between 12 and 25, came from the Downpatrick area and were accompanied by parents and volunteers. They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running. Ready Mix concrete stepped in to provide refreshments.\n\nMr Ray Carter, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister with responsibility for the DoE, was there to see the children off on their cruise.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis a fine and warming gesture by the crews of the ferries to give up their free time. I know to look at the happy faces around me that their kindness is very well received.\n\nKILLYLEAGH \u0026mdash A scheme to turn Killyleagh harbour into a boat and leisure centre has proved to be the straw which broke the back of a group of local residents. Already 104 residents have signed a petition against the scheme which has received outline planning permission.\n\nPut forward by Mr Robert Morrow, a local coal merchant and businessman, it sets out his hopes to construct pontoon jetties, a clubhouse, toilet block, bar, restaurant, chandlery, workshop and car parking spaces.\n\nThe residents, while believing that there is an urgent need for the harbour to be brought up to an acceptable standard, feel that the scheme falls short of that is required and that it is likely to have a \u0026ldquomost undesirable impact on the residential area surrounding the site.\n\nRATHMULLAN \u0026mdash The Rathmullan Mound is to stay \u0026mdash or at least the best part of it is. After four months of intensive archaeological digging, experts have ruled that the Mound is too valuable to be removed, though they have taken away the top section.\n\nBut although the Department of the environment has put a protection order on the site it will not be taking the Mound into public ownership in the way it has done with other ancient monuments.\n\nThat decision is expected to anger local historians and Down councillors, who have been battling to save the monument from demolition and who have called for it to be taken into public charge.\n\nThe Mound is a rath dating back to early Christian times, with evidence of five dferent settlements from 700 AD to the 16th century. The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage. This 1,000 year-old chamber was used by early inhabitants of the area and is still as perfect in parts as it was when it was first built.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash Female wrestling comes to Ballygowan in a big way tonight when Blackfoot Sue takes the ring at The Squire\u0026rsquos Inn.\n\nThe shapely wrestler from the USA gets to grips with another lady grappler, Manchester\u0026rsquos Miss Lena. The bout is sure to be the star attraction at this initial venture by the Ballygowan night spot.\n\nBut several other star bouts are on the programme, including world middleweight champion Adrian Street, Prince Jitsu and Bruce McDonald.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Hugh Duggan, the newly appointed progressional at Ardglass Golf Club, took up his position at the seaside club on Monday. Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster. He is John James McIlhone, from Kilmore, Crossgar, who graduated with a second class honours BA ision one in history.\n\nIn the junior section Richard Parkes, of Field Marshal Montgomery, came out on top.\n\nSAINTFIELD \u0026mdash A woman was taken to hospital on Saturday night after two cars were involved in an accident on the Crossgar Road, Saintfield.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres.

Association, and of possessing a document bearing an oath of allegiance to the paramililtary organisation, was handed a three-year sentence on Thursday. \n\n                \nSending David Coleman to prison, Judge Geoffrey Miller said the evidence presented to the court suggested the 32-year old’s responsibility within the UDA was at a “local level” as opposed to a him being a “directing figure.”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFreedom Corner on the Newtownards Road in east Belfast where are there UDA symbols, pictures of gunmen, loyalist slogans and the crest of the Ulster Young Militants.\u0027Picture By: Arthur Allison.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe judge also described the UDA as an illegal organisation steeped in “brutal thuggery, extortion and drug dealing ... which offers nothing to the community it leeches off”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nColeman, a father-of-one from The Green in Holywood, was charged with two terrorist offences following searches of properties connected to him last summer, namely belonging to the UDA on dates between November 6, 2016 and October 18, 2017, and of possessing a document likely to be useful for terrorism.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nDespite initially denying the offences, Coleman - who Belfast Crown Court heard was originally from the Shankill area of Belfast - subsequently pleaded guilty to the charges, and was handed a three-year sentence. He was told he will serve 18 months in custody, followed by 18 months in licence when he is released.\n\nBefore passing sentence, Judge Miller was told by a Crown prosecutor that a number of items were seized during searches of properties linked to Coleman on June 19 last year.\n\nIn one property, police saw a black UFF flag flying at the front of the house, while a mobile phone was located in a second house.  \n\nThe prosecutor revealed that a deleted text was sent to multiple recipients from the phone, which said : “Lads the more ya look around the more ya realise were defo back on our feet and it feels gd when the world put us down and laughed at us not to many laughing now is there but always keep our feet on the floor we don’t show of or act big lads we dont need to and its done us wonders no fighting or shit we any of were coming togeather building abit at a time it a team effort it cant work we out team work and our teams gd and were doing things that ppl said couldnt d done well the last two years say it all the future lads togeather and go forward watp qs 2nd batt c coy.” \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nOne person responded by writing “QS bro.”\n\nThe prosecutor said it was the Crown’s case that the text was linked to the UDA - especially Coleman’s use of ‘watp’ for ‘we are the people’ and ‘QS’ for ‘Quis Separabit’. He also revealed that images were found on the phone, including pictures of Coleman at UDA/C Company murals on the Shankill.\n\nThe court heard further searches were carried out, and on October 17 last year police recovered a document used to swear an oath of allegiance to the UDA and which bore Coleman’s fingerprints. The prosecutor said: “Also recovered was a great deal of material indicative of membership.”\n\nThe prosecutor added Coleman’s criminal record - which includes offences for rioting, robbery and carrying an imitation firearm - was a “signicant aggravating factor.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDefence barrister Charles MacCreanor QC said Coleman’s plea should be welcomed by the Crown, as there would have been dficulties in prosecuting the case as a majority of the evidence against his client was “hearsay and circumstantial.”\n\nPointing out Coleman’s plea indicated an acceptance of responsibility, Mr MacCreanor spoke of the mundane nature of the texts, which he said were “certainly not organising criminal activity.”\n\nThe barrister also addressed Coleman’s criminal record, telling the court he was charged with disorderly behaviour at 14, and rioting at 15 and again at 16 - around the same time Coleman was expelled from school, with the barrister telling the court Coleman “fell in with what is often described as negative peers.”\n\n                            \n            \n

     \n\nMORE:\n \nIan Paisley thanks voters after narrowly surviving recall petition\n\nThe North Antrim MP was suspended from membership of the party on July 24 pending further investigation, after the House of Commons’ Standards Committee found he had committed “serious misconduct” in relation to his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government, then lobbying the UK government on their behalf.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe was also handed a 30-day ban from the House of Commons.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn a statement today, a DUP spokesperson said: “The internal processes surrounding these matters have been completed.  \n\n“On Tuesday, September 18 Mr Paisley was readmitted to membership of the party following a suspension of 57 days and upon re-admission he is subject to a number of conditions including a ban on holding office within the party for 12 months.”\n\nThe party said it would be making no further comment on these matters.\n\nIn the early hours of this morning, Mr Paisley learned that he had surviving a bid to oust him from his Westminster seat.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe clung on to his seat after the UK’s first ever recall petition fell just 444 votes short of the total required to force a by-election.\n\n\n\nStorm Bronagh to bring rain to Northern Ireland\n\n\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\nCookie Settings\n\n\n\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp
