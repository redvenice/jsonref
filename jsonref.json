That could be done by Jobcentre staff.\u0027TUI recruited IPs from a range of backgrounds and professions, including at least two former minicab drivers with no apparent previous experience or background in deradicalisation work. \u0027There was one guy who could not even string a sentence together, and he was hired,\u0027 said a former IP.According to a source, the Home Office was told that at least one former theme park worker was taken on by TUI and then set to work deradicalising IS returnees.The whistleblowers also alleged that Dr Misra and Mr Raja paid higher hourly rates to those who were devotees of a cleric called Sheikh Aleey Qadir who the couple followed. And two former employees said Mr Raja was detained by police following an alleged leak of classified information held by TUI.It is understood that no further action was taken by the police, but that Mr Raja received a written warning from the Home Office and was banned from providing one-to-one mentoring with extremists himself.One of the iniduals seen by TUI was Lewis Ludlow, a convert who was plotting a devastating terror attack in Oxford Street while being mentored by the company.The 27-year-old planned to blow up an explosive-laden truck in Central London bringing death and mayhem to one of Britain\u0027s busiest shopping streets.Ludlow, from Rochester, Kent, had previously been stopped by police at Heathrow Airport while trying to board a plane to the Philippines to join IS\u0027s terrorist wing there. His plot was foiled because counter-terrorism chiefs had decided to put him under surveillance.Ludlow was found guilty of terrorism offences and given a life sentence.Last night the Home Office declined to comment, but a source confirmed that a number of complaints had been made about TUI which had resulted in due diligence checks within the department.\u0027In order to get out of the contract, the Home Office offered TUI new terms which were unreasonable, so the company has decided to walk away from the contract,\u0027 the source said, adding that the new Home Secretary, Priti Patel, had expressed concern about the number of \u0027bad contracts\u0027 that had been negotiated by the department with private companies.\u0027There are too many bad contracts that are too difficult to get out of quickly at the moment,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Priti\u0027s finding all sorts of things and is going to get a grip on the way the department contracts services.\u0027         Getting a grip: Home Secretary Priti Patel has raised concern over \u0027bad contracts\u0027  that have been negotiated with private companies In a statement, the Home Office said: \u0027Keeping the public safe is our first priority, and an important part of this is working with iniduals who have been radicalised to reintegrate them safely back into society.\u0027Mentors working to help deradicalise iniduals drawn into extremism have a difficult and demanding task and are serving a vital public interest.\u0027The wellbeing of these mentors, and the support provided to them, is of critical importance.\u0027Home Office suppliers are subject to robust contract management to ensure the highest standards are being delivered.\u0027Dr Misra and Mr Raja declined numerous requests for comment.A brief message sent to The Mail on Sunday by the company said that due to the nature of TUI\u0027s work, there are iniduals willing to make complaints against it with \u0027malicious intent\u0027.TUI added that it was proud of its work to deradicalise iniduals who might pose a danger to society over the past decade.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Jeremy Corbyn left red faced Labour delivered leaflets demanding Election now","story":"Share this article In June he said ‘we must let the people decide our country’s future, through an immediate General Election.’ And in July he held a rally outside Parliament to demand a new vote.Last week he insisted a new Election would be ‘the democratic way forward’.However, he is widely expected to vote against an Election again on Monday.

The excuses might have seemed more plausible but for the fact the couple had already whisked Archie to party island Ibiza in early August and to stay at Sir Elton John’s luxury villa in the south of France just days later.         The Queen watches yesterday\u0027s Highland Games with the Duchess of Cornwall and they both opt for a vibrant dress codeThen, on Friday, Meghan made a last-minute 3,500-mile dash across the Atlantic to watch close friend Serena Williams compete in the final of the US Open tennis tournament – perhaps her clearest statement yet that, whatever the expectations of her new Royal role, this particular Duchess is determined to march to a drum beat of her own.If the couple’s absence from Balmoral might have initially seemed as merely disappointing, now it has all the appearance of an outright snub. The Mail on Sunday understands the Queen is ‘hurt and disappointed’ at a time when she likes to bring her friends and family together. The annual Highland holiday is the Queen’s favourite time of the year and she was, according to a source, looking forward to ‘a few days of merry chaos’ with the great-grandchildren, including Archie.It is understood Her Majesty is already ‘baffled’ by Meghan and Harry’s inability to steer clear of PR calamities, and is concerned that her beloved grandson and his new wife are failing to listen to their team of advisers.              Chuffed: Meghan appears to be care-free and having the time of her life as she flies to New York without baby Archie to see Serena. Questions remain over where her loyalty lies between the royals and celebrity friends         She was due to watch the match from a box reserved for the player\u0027s friends, family and coaches and the Queen has said she is \u0027disappointed and hurt\u0027 by the decision to not attend the Highland gatheringNow Meghan’s impromptu flight to New York without her baby son has made the situation all too plain: however tempting it must have been to see her friend Miss Williams, it was simply not the case that the Duchess’s hectic schedule prevented her from travelling to Scotland.The questions are now inevitable as to where Meghan’s loyalties lie – with the Royal Family, or with her celebrity friends and the VIP lifestyle she was supposed to have set aside upon her marriage to Harry.That it appears she is increasingly more aligned with Hollywood – and the world of her celebrity friends – is a cause of some concern. Indeed, Meghan is said to have told magazine executives at fashion bible Vogue that she wanted to ‘break the internet’ with the edition she guest-edited in September – an intriguing insight into how she sees her role.         The Duchess stood up to give her a round of applause as Serena walked on to the court         Markle spent the final moments socialising and warmly embracing Alexis Ohanian just before the game began The phrase was popularised by US reality star Kim Kardashian, after she released an image of herself wearing black latex and appearing to pour champagne into a glass balanced on her bottom. Is this appropriate for a senior member of the Royal Family?While the hard-working Queen received the Prime Minister and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds at her summer residence this weekend, Meghan is understood to have alleviated any stress she may have had by attending a hot yoga class shortly after touching down in Manhattan on Friday.The new mother joined 60 other so-called ‘sweaty souls’ at the eco-conscious Modo Yoga in the West Village. A source told People magazine: ‘There were lots of sweet, knowing smiles among some of the respectful patrons. She has been going to Modo Yoga for many years and tries to do so whenever she is in New York. It was the perfect remedy for jet-lag.’It is not known where she is staying during the short trip, but her close friend, fashion designer Misha Nonoo, has a £4 million home close to the yoga studio. She was due to watch Miss Williams’ match from a box reserved for the player’s friends, family and coaches.         She met Serena Williams at a Super Bowl party in 2010, and their friendship is thought to have quickly evolved         Serena attends Meghan\u0027s wedding to Prince Harry with husband and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in May last yearThe Duchess, whose ambition, independence and strength of character is what drew Harry to her in the first place, seems determined to carve her own path.For example, she has brought in a team of her own PRs – in addition to those already in place at Buckingham Palace, which includes Hillary Clinton’s former campaign adviser Sara Latham – in a bid to take control of her faltering public image.US crisis management firm Sunshine Sachs was reportedly paid £6,000 by Meghan to improve her reputation and assist with the launch of the Vogue edition.It also managed Harry’s launch for the Sussex Royal Foundation in Amsterdam, promoting an eco-travel online initiative, during which he was forced to defend his use of private jets. A source told The Sun: ‘This is Meghan’s way of being able to get a Hollywood answer to a question if she’s not hearing what she wants to from the Palace.‘But that’s a dangerous precedent to set because there is a reason why courtiers and advisers treat members of the Royal Family differently – they are not celebrities, they are publicly funded official figures with a formal role. And they need to hear the truth, even if it’s not the answer they want. That’s something Harry does not like and Meghan isn’t familiar with from her former career. They appear tone-deaf to criticism at times.’It means the Queen, who has always been close to Harry, is now said to have been keeping a ‘close eye’ on his household. The monarch is understood to believe that the Sussexes’ diminishing popularity and frequent mishaps could have been avoided if they had taken the advice of her own trusted team.The feeling among the Queen’s most senior courtiers and those at Kensington Palace is that Harry is taking too much for granted and is not listening enough, preferring to make publicity-grabbing gestures such as his barefoot appearance at the recent Google climate change retreat in Sicily.Her Majesty’s private office is providing her with regular updates on their affairs.More worrying still, sources are suggesting that, for the first time, there are differences of opinion emerging between the Queen and her grandson. The tensions between Harry and William are well documented. The so-called ‘orce’ of their respective households was finalised last week when Harry and Meghan moved their offices from Kensington Palace to Buckingham Palace, and the Sussexes have also formally quit the Royal Foundation designed to harness the power of what was set to be the ‘Fab Four’. But since Harry’s marriage to Meghan, there has been a series of incidents which are also said to have tested his bond with his grandmother.The Queen has publicly endorsed Meghan, welcoming her into the Royal Family and supporting her transition from Hollywood actress to HRH. Last year, less than a month after their marriage, the Duchess was invited to join the Queen on a joint official visit to the North West. The two women travelled overnight from London together on the Royal Train, a significant honour.And it still might be the case, as many hope, that Meghan’s energy, drive and fierce intelligence will help invigorate the Royal Family and widen its appeal to a younger generation.         The £2.4 million taxpayers’ bill for refurbishing Frogmore Cottage (pictured), and the Sussexes’ summer holidays, have also come in for criticism. The trip to Balmoral would have gone some way towards mitigating all of this with the public, and with the Queen herselfEven back then, however, there seem to have been tensions. Her Majesty is understood to have been concerned about their respective understanding of their roles, rights and responsibilities .The issues were minor and domestic. The Queen had offered her experienced in-house team to do the Sussexes’ wedding flowers and the wedding cake, but Meghan brought in visionary flower designer Philippa Craddock and fashionable cakemaker Claire Ptak instead. There was a famous falling-out over a tiara when Meghan wanted to wear an emerald headpiece, but the Queen wisely counselled that the gems were of Russian origin.The Queen also witnessed Meghan scolding a Royal chef over a macrobiotic wedding dish which she claimed contained eggs – and it was the bride-to-be who then got a telling off.When tempers rose over other aspects of the wedding plans, Harry reportedly told staff, ‘what Meghan wants, Meghan gets…’ which saw the Queen summon him to a private meeting and giving him a grandmotherly dressing down. True, the issues were minor. But if the monarch thought that all this was pre-wedding nerves then she was mistaken – it was only a foretaste of what was to come.A year of controversies followed, including the Duchess’s ostentatious £350,000 ‘baby shower’ in New York, the botched announcement of the Duchess’s labour (when Archie had, in fact, already been born) and details of the christening kept so private that the date was announced too late for the Queen to attend.The £2.4 million taxpayers’ bill for refurbishing Frogmore Cottage, and the Sussexes’ summer holidays, have also come in for criticism. The trip to Balmoral would have gone some way towards mitigating all of this with the public, and with the Queen herself.But it is telling that, according to a well-placed source, Meghan is determined to ‘take America by storm and is more focused on America than anywhere else’.It is clearly the case that Meghan works extraordinarily hard, often rising at 5am – motherhood shows no sign of slowing her down – and that she has the capacity for much good.Take, for example, the clothing collection she is creating with high street brands such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer and John Lewis for Smart Works.The charity is being launched on Thursday and offers interview outfits and coaching for women from disadvantaged backgrounds as they enter the jobs market.It is undoubtedly a brilliant cause which has won the Duchess deserved praise, but it has failed to assuage the sense that she is pursuing her own projects, rather than what is expected of a senior member of the Royal Family. The Queen, having spent 67 years as monarch, is right to be concerned.In the tug of war between Royal duty and self-interest, there can only be one winner. "},{"url":null,"title":"Head teachers earning Prime Minister including one 260k ordered justify it","story":"Share this article          Michael Gove pledged that no head teacher would earn more than the Prime Minister, when he was Education SecretaryAs Education Secretary, Michael Gove pledged in 2010 that no head teacher would earn more than the PM. All those who earn above £150,000 are employed by academy schools, which operate outside local authority control and are free to set their own pay rates.Lord Agnew has written to 271 academy trusts, with 51 promising to cut senior salaries.High earners include Colin Hall, head of Holland Park School in West London – once dubbed ‘the socialist Eton’ – who earned £260,000 last year, and Dayo Olukoshi, executive head of Brampton Manor Academy in East London, who took home £220,000.Chris Keates, acting general secretary of teachers’ union the NASUWT said: ‘Head teachers have a demanding job and their pay should reflect this. However, the excessive freedoms and flexibilities over pay given to schools by the Government in too many cases has led to an abuse of the system.’               Top earners: Lord Agnew has written to 271 academy trusts, with 51 promising to cut senior salaries -

Of the handful of homes still standing, most are without roofs.Some residents, including Euridice Kemp, were quick to link the ferocity of hurricane Dorian to the global climate crisis.Kemp, who returned to the town to salvage what she could from her grandparents’ home, said: “What we’re doing to Mother Earth and the way this turns around on areas like here … I just can’t. Never … never in my life. My heart is broken. I’m in shock.”The sheer force of the winds was enough to transform this area for the foreseeable future. Trees that have stood for generations were uprooted. Large structures, including a nearby lighthouse, are partially or completely destroyed.Many here are only beginning to come to terms with what they have lost. Hardly anyone knows what will happen next: whether to rebuild, or start over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/259d827165c037ee6cb5b078567889168a3804e9/0_375_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d44cd1e6b2aa73de34a61f55099eb53","title":"black country blues industrial midlands 80s photographs john myers","story":"Photographer John Myers documented the industry of the West Midlands as it collapsed under Thatcherism. His stark images, now enjoying a revival, give context to our current isionsJohn Myers took these photographs in the Black Country of the West Midlands in the mid-1980s. They are included now in a book of his photographs called The End of Industry, but at the time Myers had no sense that the foundries and yards they depicted would shortly join many other iron and steel and metal-bashing companies in the region and be gone for good.Myers, born in 1944, a student and then lecturer in fine art, had during the 70s been taking sly social realist photographs of his suburban neighbourhood in Stourbridge, and of more urban Dudley and beyond. “We spend a lot of our lives blocking out the world that we live in, just how awful it is, just how boring it is,” he says. His photography, inspired equally by the pioneering documentarist Eugène Atget and the urban American geometries of Ed Ruscha, was all about looking, about not blocking out. Some of the pictures that have become known as “the boring pictures” were careful series of dual carriageways, electricity substations and idle televisions in the corners of neat, pinched sitting rooms.After the arrival of Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1979, Myers started looking more closely at the environments of working lives near where he lived. He was involved in Labour politics, but the pictures were not intended to be polemical in any narrow sense, rather to show the industrial landscape as it was. The pace of factory closures that struck the Black Country was impossible to predict, even at the closest quarters. He had no sense that what he was photographing would look in retrospect like a final chapter. “Companies folded and factories were demolished at an unbelievably rapid rate in the couple of years after these pictures,” he says now, looking back. “People in that area had got used to that way of life since the Industrial Revolution – good employment, reasonable wages – and then that was all just clobbered overnight.”Unlike the shipyards and docklands of the north-east or the mills and textile factories of Manchester, the relatively small-scale chain-making operations of Cradley Heath, the foundries of Brierley Hill and the brickworks of Kingswinford did not lend themselves to being recast as warehouse apartments. Many were simply flattened others emptied out as goods yards and storage facilities.“The big shock,” Myers says, “was the new landscape that emerged from that clearance, of warehousing and logistics and retail parks and enterprise zones and tarmac.” Local people, he suggests, are still living with the abrupt loss of human scale.Myers made the portraits in this series, like all the work of that time, with a “cloth-over-the-head” Gandolfi camera. The long exposure perhaps added to the air of resignation in the foundry worker’s face, or in the shoulders of the woman beside her table piled with muck in the brick factory, or the concentration in the posture of the lathe operator. Myers used natural light, which was frequently in short supply. He loved the depth of background detail that the format captured. The foundry worker in his beret is impossible to isolate from any of the objects that surround him the looped chain, and the sluice and the metal pail and the corrugated doorway and the pile of steel moulds are as essential to the scene as he is. The effect Myers was hoping for was to render the people as simply another element in spaces that they had probably known all of their working lives, “as if it was their living room”.Myers stopped taking photographs in 1990, and has devoted much of his subsequent creative life to painting, while continuing to work in higher education in Stourbridge. He had sent some of his photographs out to galleries in the 1980s but there was no interest. “At the time,” he says, “people looked at them but, as it were, didn’t see them.” Most of the photographs in the current book were not even printed up. His work – the “boring photographs” first – was rediscovered by the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, and featured at Martin Parr’s national photography archive in Bristol. There was a significant exhibition of these industrial photographs in Bologna last year.Myers is somewhat amused, but also gratified, by the sudden late exposure. “The fact was,” he says, “you didn’t get that many international art dealers hovering around in Stourbridge.” He does not think that the new interest has come entirely by chance, however. We are at a moment in British political life in which we are trying to understand how on earth we got here. The legacy of those brutally abrupt changes in the years of Myers’s photographs are still unravelling in the places they depict. “What was happening to Britain in 1985 perhaps explains a lot of what is happening in 2019,” he says.The End of Industry by John Myers, published by RRB PhotoBooks, £75, is out now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a89ba41794dde85f0e2f0ca2069ba1c5554001d2/0_2151_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8546d2622322ab0eca47b00e24d9576","title":"artist barbara walker used experience of racism to inform work","story":"Place, Space and Who looks at the experiences of five black women living in the Kent townBarbara Walker relocated to Margate for a residency that allowed her to take over one of the Turner Contemporary’s galleries – a light-filled, cavernous space with floor-to-ceiling windows that look out over the Kent coastline. Although the room faced outwards over the North Sea, Walker decided to use the commission to look inward and explore race, migration and modern Britain in the form of five imposing portraits of black women, all of whom have moved to the local area.“Birmingham and Margate both voted to leave the EU,” says Walker, who admits it was that connection that drew her to the seaside town. “I really didn’t know what to make of it – it’s not a rural space, it’s not an urban space, it’s a different space.”Walker said the situation didn’t faze her and if anything made her believe she was in exactly the right place for a piece that explored race and modern Britain. “We are living in disturbing times, it’s almost as if we’ve gone back 20 years,” says Walker.The artist says the rise of the far right and her own experiences of growing up in the UK when racial isions were front page news in the 1970s and 1980s, inform her work. “I grew up during the rise of the National Front when Enoch Powell was spouting his rhetoric and it’s come full circle again. It’s quite disturbing for this generation and for future generations, so I think it’s important to challenge these issues. I try to tackle issues that people might not necessarily want to discuss.”Walker was born in Birmingham, left home by 14 and had three children by the time she was 21. She describes herself as a “hustler” who had to be creative to make ends meet but always harboured a desire to be a full-time artist. “I didn’t fall into the role of an artist,” says Walker, “it was planned”. Inspired by figures including Sonia Boyce, Claudette Johnson and the black arts movement of the 1980s, in her late 20s she went to university in Birmingham and got a first-class degree in art and design, before slowly building a career based on intricate figurative drawing.The work she is most proud of was an exhibition that focused on stop and search, and was inspired by her son’s experiences of being stopped by the police in Birmingham. “That work came from the perspective of a parent, it was happening in the world but it was also happening to me and my son. My son was just walking to work and he was stopped.”Walker says curators told her to tone down her work in order to appeal to a wider audience and avoid being marginalised as a “political artist”. She ignored the advice: “I can’t be producing nonsensical topics when people are dying, when black men are dying in police custody,. I find it hard to make pretty pictures. I’m interpreting the world around me and pushing against the grain.”The art world will be confronted with Walker’s portraits when the Turner prize exhibition is held in Margate this autumn, and it’s a meeting the artist is looking forward to. “Someone said, ‘Your work will fit in when the Turner Prize opens,’” says Walker. “I told them, ‘No, the Turner Prize will fit in with me,’”“That little white space represents a lot,” adds Walker, speaking about the gallery. “I wanted to disrupt it. And I am.”Barbara Walker: Place, Space and Who is at the Turner Contemporary until April 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7692536b84b58cb9342678d2cd813000c36a24a4/0_94_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bc8e84cb3854d29000ab180670f8fdd","title":"muslim woman who photographed bradford last synagogue jewish worshippers nudrat afza","story":"Nudrat Afza, a single mother who can’t afford her own camera, talks us through her new show – of poignant shots capturing the last 45 Jewish worshippers in the city’s only remaining synagogueThe last UK census, which took place in 2011, found that there were just 299 Jews left in Bradford, a tiny number for a city that became home to so many German Jews in the 19th century that the warehouse district they created is still called Little Germany. The Muslim population, meanwhile, hit 129,041 the same year.The city’s synagogue, a grade II-listed building, almost shut down in 2013, unable to afford roof repairs – until the Muslim community raised funds to cover costs. A £103,000 lottery grant followed, enabling full repairs, but the number of worshippers has stuck stubbornly at just 45 – with occasional newcomers balancing out the deaths of elderly worshippers.All of this caught the attention of Nudrat Afza, a Muslim single mother who – despite never being able to afford her own camera – is about to exhibit a series of photographs documenting the dwindling population of Bradford’s last remaining synagogue. Afza, who came to the UK from Pakistan as a teenager in the late 1960s, made friends with Rudi Leavor, the synagogue’s “93-and-a-quarter-year-old” chairman, after carrying out a particularly heroic mission to transfer a fridge from a synagogue in nearby Shipley when it closed in 2013. Leavor arrived in Bradford as a refugee in 1937, part of the second wave of German Jews fleeing the Nazis.Non-Jews are welcome to attend services, says Leavor, as this is a modern reform synagogue. “They can sing along and so forth, but they can’t take part actively – for example, when we carry the Torah around the synagogue, they can’t do that. And they can’t read prayers from the altar. But we welcome anyone to come and join us.”Built in 1880 in an unusual Moorish style, the place of worship had its second heyday after the second world war. “On the high holy days,” says Leavor, “the synagogue was so full we had to put extra seats in the aisles. But over time, people started moving away, often to London or, like my own four children, married out of the faith. In my cynical opinion, if we didn’t have such a beautiful building, the Jewish community in Bradford would already have gone elsewhere, but we have become a focal point that people like to visit.”Two years ago, Afza embarked on her project to photograph what felt like the synagogue’s final chapter, wondering how long it would last. “There are fewer and fewer Jewish people left,” she says. “It’s this declining population and disappearing culture that I wanted to document.”The photographs, all black and white, capture a mixture of the modern and the traditional: an electric menora illuminates two women as they read a prayer book, one with dip-dyed hair a young woman in a leather jacket looks on as a bald man in kippah and prayer shawl bows his head. Slightly grainy, they convey with intimate tenderness a community Afza has come to know and treasure as much as her own.The rabbi refused her request to take pictures during services, unless she used a telephoto lens, which she could not afford, so they let her take pictures before and after. Afza has never been able to afford a camera since becoming a full-time carer for her disabled daughter 31 years ago, relying instead on borrowed equipment and grants. Her exhibition, Kehillah, which can mean congregation or community in Hebrew, is supported by Arts Council England.Photographing inside the dimly lit synagogue posed particular challenges, even with top-of-the-range cameras, including a medium-format Bronica and an XPan Hasselblad given to her on permanent loan by Simon Beaufoy, the Oscar-winning screenwriter behind The Full Monty and Slumdog Millionaire. Beaufoy became a fan after seeing Afza’s exhibition about the female supporters of Bradford City football club and insists the camera is hers to keep, though she won’t accept it.“Everyone with a phone can take a photograph,” says Beaufoy. “But not everybody is a photographer. In the colourful noise of a billion images, a few people stand out. Nudrat is one of them. Like all the best art, the images reflect the artist: watchful, politely enquiring, melancholic with the hint of a smile.”Afza has never had a lesson and doesn’t work digitally, not having access to email or the internet. But she has always loved photography, particularly the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson and the war photographer Don McCullin, who has himself documented Bradford’s Muslim community. She has now been made an honorary member of the synagogue and continues to be a regular visitor. “I think she has more to do with us,” says Leavor, “than with her own mosque.”• Kehillah is at the Boardrooms, Salts Mill, Saltaire, 13-22 September.

We visit their Newcastle HQ to find the secret of their successOne morning towards the end of summer I pay a visit to London Bridge station. The day is warm and sunny and, in spite of the news, which is as unrelentingly grim as ever, I feel suddenly hopeful optimism rising inside me like mercury in a thermometer. The station, whose acclaimed £1bn remodelling by Grimshaw Architects has been shortlisted for the 2019 Stirling prize, is airy and spacious, in spite of the crowds it must accommodate, and the ribbons of wood that cover the ceilings of its vast concourse give it a Scandinavian feel, at once modest and grand. It is like some 21st-century cathedral: a rush-hour temple that for all its circulatory efficiency is determined to remind the harried commuter that there is more to life than work that a moment of contemplation is worth, if not a missed train, then at least a dozen emails.The new London Bridge is, to my eyes, Britain in microcosm its history and its people. Its brick viaducts, for instance, speak of its Victorian beginnings – the first station to be built in the capital, it dates from 1836 – while Grimshaw’s concrete arches subtly conjure postwar brutalism and the building boom of those years. There is an ineffable sense of confidence here, of a kind that many of us haven’t much felt since 2012 and the Olympics. Western Arcade, which links the mainline station to the underground, is devoted to smart shops such as Kiehl’s and the shirtmaker TM Lewin, as well as to a breed of cafe that sells – a sight new to me – “red velvet croissants”. But since last December it has also been home to a branch of the somewhat less elite Greggs, Britain’s largest and best-value bakery chain, where a hungry traveller in search of a bargain can still pick up a bacon bap and a cup of coffee for just £1.80.That, however, is hardly the whole story. Greggs has been growing steadily for years now, a success story largely unnoticed by those who buy their breakfast at Starbucks, their lunch at Pret and who are very keen indeed on avocados (Greggs, incidentally, now has a greater share of the UK coffee market than Starbucks). It has had bad times, of course. Its worst year ever was 2013, when it found itself at a crossroads (we’ll come back to that). Nevertheless, it remains one of very few British businesses with an unbroken record of idend payments to its shareholders (the company was floated on the stock market in 1984).The London Bridge branch isn’t big and has no seating, but there are noticeably more customers queuing inside it than at any other store in the station and after a while I join them. I pick up a vegan sausage roll, which I will road test later, and a Portuguese custard tart (a new line in London branches) that looks just like the ones you buy in the overpriced deli near where I live, but at less than half the price. I also ask for a flat white and a bacon roll (the latter is made to order, with the sauce of your choice). The bill comes to £5.10.Minutes later, I’m outside again, sitting on a bench, people-watching, roof-gazing and eating: my own moment of contemplation. I consider myself an aficionado of bacon butties and this one is excellent: the white roll, smeared with ketchup, is soft with a good crumb and the bacon is crisp and not too salty. The coffee is also good, if a bit exiguous. This bap isn’t the first thing I’ve ever eaten from Greggs, but it is by some stretch the most delicious, though how much Grimshaw’s soaring edifice has to do with this, I wouldn’t like to say.In the end, however, a trip is arranged, which is how I come to be sitting in the test kitchen at Greggs’ HQ one overcast morning with Kate Jones, its senior product development manager. It was Jones’s team that developed the vegan sausage roll the very item that Piers Morgan greeted on Twitter with the words: “Nobody was waiting for a vegan bloody sausage, you PC-ravaged clowns” – cue the biggest social media storm ever to hit the world of baked goods (“Oh hello, Piers, we’ve been expecting you,” replied Greggs, smoothly). How quickly did they know it was a hit? (It’s now a bestseller, though they won’t give me numbers – on this or anything.) “From day one,” says Jones. “We got great coverage, there was Piers Morgan, and it snowballed from there.”Did she have any doubts beforehand? “It was very challenging. Rolling a new product like this out is difficult because the whole supply chain has to be vegan: storage, transportation, how it’s handled in the shops. It would have been easy to give up. But we knew there was a gap in the market for a hot vegan snacking product. A couple of years ago, we were working on a vegetarian sausage roll and it was almost ready for launch. It was, though, becoming very clear from customers that as more people are avoiding certain foods – like dairy, say – vegan products are becoming a proxy for flexitarian diets.”The vegetarian sausage roll was ditched and the company began working instead on a vegan one. What’s inside it? Jones smiles and looks coy. “We work with Quorn and then we add our very secret savoury flavouring.”Jones, a home economist by training, began her career at M\u0026ampS, where she worked as a buyer for 16 years later, she led food policy at the Co-op. Nevertheless, moving to Greggs represents a “big” career change for her. “I’ve come out of retail and into food-to-go,” she says. “And I’m also working in a company that is fully vertically integrated.” I must look blank, because she adds: “I mean one that makes virtually everything itself, rather than buying anything in.”Her team develops all its products, first in this kitchen, in pots and pans, and then in the industrial stage (vats, rather than pans). An average Greggs store has about 150 food products. Her team creates 50 new ones each year, though this number includes items where only an ingredient has been changed or a sandwich filling tweaked. How many people taste something before it goes out? “We have a good 30 to 50 people who do factory trials as part of their jobs and then we hold panels with the wider Greggs population, people from finance or HR or wherever, who try them. We want people who are not necessarily dead close to the product, who haven’t nursed it from conception, to say if they like it.”She takes me on a tour. First, we meet a baker, Fraser, who is icing new flavours of doughnuts that may – Jones is slightly reluctant to tell me – be launched next year: cookies and cream and honeycomb. Then we visit its sensory booths: compartments that bring to mind those cubicles you see in TV dramas in which a prisoner communicates with their visitor via a telephone through a screen. On one side of a ide someone from Jones’s team pushes whatever is to be tasted through a hatch. On the other is the taster. The cubicles are tightly controlled in terms of heat and light and no taster is able to see the reaction of their colleagues. To avoid weariness, he or she only ever tries three products at a time.What are the areas of growth for Greggs? “Health,” says Jones. The company anticipates more legislation around calorie reduction and believes it’s already well ahead in its planning for this. What else? “Hot food – and coffee is huge.” How would she sum up the company’s ethos, food-wise? “Taste and great value for money.”Are perceptions of Greggs changing? It seems to me that if they are, then the success of its vegan sausage roll is emblematic of such a shift. But what does she think? Are people still snobbish about it? Do they still think that it only sells greasy, stodgy foods to those who want, and need, to fill up quickly for very little cost?“Two years ago, I might have said yes,” she tells me. “I’d have looked at my mother and taken her as absolute proof of that. But now it’s becoming quite savvy to get it – to know about our quality.” This moment reminds her, she says, of when discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl came along. “There were Waitrose shoppers who suddenly realised they could get great commodities at Aldi.” I remember this too. “Just guess where this smoked salmon came from!” shouted the broke middle classes, as if with one voice. But are the two things really the same? She nods. “People are genuinely delighted when they explore the range of our products.”As I listen to her, I take her words with a fairly hefty pinch of salt. A few weeks later, however, I will open a magazine and there will be Nicky Haslam, the old Etonian society decorator who once claimed to have had an affair with Lord Snowdon, proudly insisting that Greggs’ coffee is “the best”.In the hope of bringing new customers – and a new kind of customer – to Greggs, the company has deployed a number of stunts. Some are cheesy. A Valentine’s Day promotion offered “fine dining” in stores, where waiters dressed in black tie served guests mini doughnuts in chocolate dipping sauce. Others are nifty and smart. Last year, for instance, it attended a food festival in Richmond, Surrey, where it offered visitors its wares under the name Gregory \u0026amp Gregory. When the sign was turned around to reveal the word Greggs, people could, says Hannah Squirrel, the company’s marketing director, “hardly believe it”.Others are downright cheeky. There is a branch of Greggs opposite Fenwick of Newcastle, the Harrods of the north. Last year, just as Fenwick’s Christmas windows were revealed to the public, a display that usually attracts a crowd, the company flipped the Greggs sign so that it would no longer be back to front when reflected in the glass. News of this coup is said to have travelled as far as Australia. Its missteps are rare, though there was an outcry in 2017 when it replaced Jesus with a sausage roll in a nativity scene (the company soon apologised).But it is a balancing act. Loyal, older customers – the kind of people, perhaps, who caused a selection of sausage roll-covered socks, umbrellas and iPhone cases to sell out at Greggs on the first day they became available – must be kept on side, too, for they are the majority and still the biggest key to its success. To that end some stores continue to stock regional items, available only in certain parts of the UK (stotties in the north-east, Empire biscuits in Scotland, Tottenham cakes in London there are reputed to be 25 such delicacies). For these customers, service is extremely important.“People will tell us proactively that they left the shop with a smile on their face,” says Squirrel. “There was banter, it was down to earth. Some people say that our staff have been known to begin making up their usual order even before they’ve stepped in the door. They’re regulars, they’re recognised, and they like that.” Are its northern roots still relevant? “Yes. Because it has never lost sight of its original values.” This filters down, she believes. It feels, she says, caring and warm.Greggs began acquiring other bakeries in 1972, first in Glasgow and Leeds, and then in Manchester, London, Kent and East Anglia (by this time, John Gregg had died and his son, Ian, a lawyer who read classics at Cambridge, was running the business he is now a philanthropist). In 1994, it acquired Bakers Oven, a chain of bakeries in the south, shops that it rebranded as Greggs in 2008. The 1,500th store, in York, opened in 2011.In his 2013 book, Bread – a memoir-cum-business-manual that includes recipes for bridies, parkin and bread cakes (otherwise known as white rolls) – Ian Gregg describes his great joy and sense of relief when, on its flotation in April 1984, the company’s shares were oversubscribed by a factor of 90. But he also writes – he was always something of a reluctant entrepreneur – of the anxiety he felt. He worried about its “culture” that its “values” might not be maintained. Three years later, in 1987, he established the Greggs Foundation. So far this year, it has provided 6.6m breakfasts to children in underprivileged communities.Roger Whiteside became chief executive in 2013, having first joined the company as a nonexecutive director. (After university in Leeds, he began his career at M\u0026ampS he then launched Ocado, worked for a private equity firm on the Thresher Group and put in a stint at Punch Taverns.) Whiteside is the kind of enthusiastic, plain-speaking leader you hear on Evan Davies’s Radio 4 business programme, The Bottom Line (he recently appeared on the podcast of retail guru Mary Portas). It comes as no surprise when he chooses to meet me for lunch in the branch of Greggs nearest his office (when I say near, what I mean is that if he chucked a hot steak bake out of his window, it would land outside the shop’s door). I’m embarrassed to admit that, at this point, I’ve never eaten in Greggs. But this doesn’t bother him at all. It’s perfect. Another convert! “Have a sausage roll,” he says. Is that what he’s having? “No, I’ve already had one this week.” He will have a chicken caesar wrap.When Whiteside joined the company he immediately liked what he saw: “Businesses operate on a moral compass and Greggs is at the nice end of that compass, as opposed to the purely hard-nosed end. I prefer this end: trying to do business in as good a way as you can, given that there is always tension between trying to make a profit and behaving well.”All the same, in 2013, he had his work cut out. “Greggs’ worst year ever. It was losing market share in bakery, where it had been competing with supermarkets for decades. To compensate for that it had been developing a presence in food-on-the-go, but it was also losing share there too, because there were so many new entrants to that sector: Costa, Subway, Tesco Express, M\u0026ampS Simply Food… We also had a coffee shop concept.”Whiteside decided that the company could not compete on three separate fronts and that it would henceforth concentrate on food-on-the-go. Its “offer” was completely revamped, with more focus on the growing breakfast market as well as on healthier and hot foods, its stores were refitted and, to support all this, its 12 factories were consolidated, with those remaining concentrating on the manufacture of just one item. (Its cream cakes are now all made in Leeds, for instance, and its rolls in Enfield.).Meanwhile, Whiteside pondered Greggs’ locations. People like Greggs, he believes, for the freshness of its goods the supermarkets sell a wider selection of sandwiches at similar prices, but unlike Greggs, theirs are made in factories and kept for two or three days (Greggs makes its sandwiches in store and they are not kept overnight). However, there is also the question of convenience. “No one leaves the house looking for a Greggs,” he says, with some honesty. “They leave the house and then they feel hungry.” Where are they likely to be when this raging hunger strikes? With footfall on the high street in decline, Greggs began opening branches in office parks, on garage forecourts and other out-of-town places. In the next five years, the company will open 100 stores every year, in the process creating 1,000 new jobs every year. And after that? “Each of our shops currently has only one queue: the walk-in queue. We want to build three: we want to add click and collect and delivery, both of which we’re trialling.” Does he visit his stores incognito? “I don’t announce myself. But in today’s video age, a lot of people recognise me. With ears like this –” he points to the sides of his head – “I haven’t got a chance! I’d need a toupee and Sellotape.”Perceptions of Greggs are changing, he says. People like me – a wide smile – have outdated views about it. However, this takes careful management. When the company ceased to be a traditional baker, people were upset. “I’ve got a drawer full of letters from customers who were angry they could no longer buy their loaf. The customer is always right, but you have to say to those who are hanging on to the past that you are not there for them any more.”As Whiteside talks – at moments, he is unstoppable – I think about Greggs and its long history. Its metamorphosis says so much about British eating habits and all the ways in which they’ve changed (and, equally, not changed at all – for don’t we still crave pastry, even if it is free of animal fats?). The company has reached its zenith, moreover, at the same time as the major political event and potential catastrophe that is Brexit. Its Britishness, its success, and this historical moment appear, in some way, to be linked, though it’s hard to pin this down precisely. Does Greggs have a position on Brexit? “No,” says Whiteside. “It’s too isive. Our customers are split. We’re not going to take sides.”Nevertheless, Britain’s leading purveyor of Empire biscuits (two rounds of shortbread stuck together with jam), emphatically does not support a no-deal Brexit. “We’re preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. If there is disruption at the port… We might go short of salad. We don’t grow enough here and you can’t store it. What if we’ve got no lettuce? Can we still make a sandwich without it? Would spinach be an acceptable replacement? Or would we have to discontinue certain sandwiches?”He looks at his chicken caesar wrap as if it contains half the mysteries of the world.Kshitij Patel, 53, IT engineer (Great Portland Street branch, London)It’s a good price – elsewhere in central London the prices are bonkers.

Iain Duncan Smith, it appears, will not only have the food he needs, he will also have the food he deserves.Dominic Cumming held back most of his Leave campaign budget to direct-market lies to 7 million unwitting Facebook users immediately prior to the referendum he helped rig. Leave agitators know all about surveillance. Presumably then, Iain Duncan Smith allowed his sickening mid-debate snack to be caught on camera deliberately. But why?Gobbling nostril refuse can have hidden health benefits. If he ate enough schnoz manure, Iain Duncan Smith could theoretically make his body immune to bacteria, like a Marvel superhero given powers by the accidental ingestion of gallons of mucus. That which does not kill us makes us stronger.Though superficially sickening, Iain Duncan Smith eating his own conk filth is as life-enhancing as if he were to drink his own urine, though it would doubtless be disrespectful for Iain Duncan Smith to do either of these while Ken Clarke was speaking, especially directly from the source.Tellingly, Iain Duncan Smith did not even lean forward to offer any of his hand-mined nosegays to Theresa May, who was sitting just in front of him, and would doubtless have loved to lick dry mucus balls from the debonair Brexiter’s fingers.On Wednesday lunchtime, I watched prime minister’s questions live on TV, wondering if I might catch another glimpse of Iain Duncan Smith feasting on different by-products of his own body, while lying Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-The-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Turds Johnson avoided all Corbyn’s direct questions.Perhaps Iain Duncan Smith would be caught scraping wax out of his own ears and spreading it on a Jacob’s Cracker or licking his own belly-button fluff off a stick as if it were fairground candyfloss or sprinkling dried smegma flakes from beneath his foreskin on to a strawberry ice cream and saying: “Yum! Yum! I love eating smegma!” Everyone will have the food they need.Commentators who view Turds’ adviser Cumming as an omnipotent Rasputin assume nothing happens in his Brexit gazebo by accident. Even Cumming’s reported red wine rampage around Portcullis House on Tuesday night may have been calculated to suggest he was unhinged enough to accelerate Britain off the cliff.But which part of the Game Theory strategy book was it that encouraged Cumming to make a former Scots Guard eat his own dried nasal mucus off his own fingertip in full view of millions of viewers, like some horrific snot-gobbling circus freak in a downbeat midwestern carnival sideshow?Did Cumming plan Iain Duncan Smith’s visible consumption of his face filth as a distraction from the new government’s ongoing Brexit bungle, just as the ostentatious arrival of a compliant, and thus criminally complicit, Welsh dog at 10 Downing Street was clearly timed to hit the front pages and eclipse Turds’ continued humiliations? If this was the case, it worked for me.Last week, Cumming made Turds attempt to gull the opposition into backing an election, in order to have the numbers to force through a no-deal Brexit. Turds performed each of Cumming’s pronouncements against a backdrop of increasingly hostile yowling, eventually disintegrating into the sadomasochistic Friars’ Roast of Turds’ Wednesday night evisceration.On Tuesday, Cumming suddenly lost his majority and then dramatically removed the whip from the grandson of the Jamaican reggae singer Winston Reedy, a totemic figure to the Tory party generally, and Turds specifically, who once ate jerk chicken with David Cameron at Oxford’s Haile Selassie Eating House in the mid-80s.If no deal is successfully legislated against, and Cumming is unable to force an election by some backdoor method, then Turds may be trapped in ineffectual office, a Netto Prometheus, chained to the dispatch box, his liver pecked out anew every day by the crows of truth. In the bright lights of parliament, Turds is as strange and tragic as the Fonz with his laugh track removed. And yet here am I, still fixated instead upon Iain Duncan Smith, lapping his bacteria-ridden slime off his hands. Cumming is an evil genius. He played me like a pipe.The big red bus, with “Let’s Suck Our Own Mucus Off Our Own Fingers and Eat It and Fund the NHS Instead” written on its side, is discredited. Iain Duncan Smith must advance toward the electorate in a spirit of compromise, a dried clod of his own snot on one index finger, the other index finger scrupulously clean, showing that he is at the heart of the party that can unite both extremes of broken Brexit Britain.Everyone will have the food they need.

The first was the belief that engaging in a deep and broad partnership, with the necessary compromises and disadvantages that brings alongside all its benefits, was an act of treacherous self-sabotage. The second was a wholly unrealistic assessment of Britain’s international status and heft, rooted in a vague, nostalgic vision of its imperial past. A third myth sprang from these two: that a post-Brexit Britannia would emerge triumphant, a beacon of democracy, parliamentary sovereignty and prosperity, shining across the waves.The last three years have left such ideas in tatters the last week has ripped the remaining shreds away. Its events have left Britain appearing not only backwards-looking, irrational and ided, but fanatical, bitter, frivolous, chaotic and heedless of any legal or customary impediment to the executive. Boris Johnson promised a stroll to sunlit meadows now he offers a grim, hellish march towards no deal, and his troops have had enough.Consider now the external view. The EU diplomats with whom we will have to work, with or without a deal, are ever more frustrated by the game-playing and have accused the prime minister of reneging on pledges to uphold the Good Friday agreement. (The taoiseach, who will on Monday meet Mr Johnson, has already warned that he does not expect any breakthroughs.) But other parties are just as scathing. In his Radio 4 series As Others See Us, Neil MacGregor noted that respect for Britain’s parliamentary democracy and steady pragmatism are much diminished, and that the world sees an unsettled nation cut adrift from its moorings. One American columnist dubbed this week Britain’s stupidest hour, while Canada’s Globe and Mail, describing the appetite for national self-destruction, observed that the Tories had transformed themselves into a protest party “even while continuing to govern a Group of Seven nation with a permanent seat on the United Nations security council”. Implicit in that statement was a question: how long, in these circumstances, can we maintain this standing and hang on to these levers? That the Trump administration cheers Britain towards the exit, as Vice-President Mike Pence did again in London this week, is a cause for concern, not reassurance. It wants to speed our course not from its deep amity towards the UK, but its deep hostility towards the EU. Any opportunity to undermine European cohesion, weakening it in global trade and diplomacy (notably vis-a-vis Iran), is welcome. A trade deal with Britain, inevitably on terms highly favourable to America, will merely be the glaze on the chlorinated chicken.With friends like these, who needs to make more enemies? To say that Britain’s hard power has long been in decline is merely an expression of the obvious, not of doomsaying. Now the Brexiters who dreamed of restoring glory are daily eroding the soft power it amassed as its empire shrank. Those who doubted our goodwill and good intentions after the 2016 vote increasingly doubt our good sense too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ceedb0c9d3834c7ca099a199e87757b630be6e0/0_0_900_1260/master/900.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=90155fa311e98ef2f1692c25d449b6ab 960w","title":"adewale akinnuoye agbaje my life as black skinhead farming film","story":"There are some stories that, though they wait half a lifetime, must get told. Seven years ago, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje gave an interview to this paper in which he talked about his autobiographical film, Farming, which was then about to go into production after a dramatised reading of the script had headlined a Sundance festival promotion in London. At the time the actor was enjoying a measure of Hollywood fame for his role in the cult TV series Lost. Farming, which he had then already been writing and developing for nearly a decade, explored a real-life mystery: it was the incredible story of how he, a young Nigerian boy raised by white foster parents in 1970s Tilbury, Essex, had forged an identity for himself in a violently racist local skinhead gang, and lived to tell the tale.The film, which eventually premiered at the Toronto festival last year, goes on wider release this month. It both dramatises a brutal and moving coming-of-age and shines a light on a little-known chapter in the story of race relations in Britain: the practice that led to thousands of Nigerian children like Akinnuoye-Agbaje being ‘farmed out’ to British families in that period. When I met its creator last week in London, I suggested that having the film out in the world must produce many emotions in him, but I imagined that, given its long gestation, one of the primary ones is relief.Akinnuoye-Agbaje, back in London from his long-term home in Los Angeles, is a big-shouldered, charismatic presence, with an easy eloquence on many subjects, including his past. He agrees that “the film is an exhalation, and a huge one”. He says: “The fact is, I literally first started writing the screenplay all those years ago because I could not sleep at night.”In directing the film he has had to go through all the nightmarish boyhood trauma and violence it details for a second time. He says: “A production designer rebuilt the house which for many years was the breeding ground for my own self-hatred. At the helm of a film you don’t have the luxury of too much emotion, but afterwards, watching it, certainly.”The film has provoked “an outpouring” not only from his immediate family but from hundreds of other Nigerian British children who experienced something similar. Akinnuoye-Agbaje’s parents were among a generation of Nigerians to come to the colonial “mother country” to get a university education they could take home and use to build democracy in their newly independent nation, then beset by civil war.His father came to study law, his mother accountancy. When he was a few months old, they placed a discreet advert in a local paper to find a family that could care for him while they studied and worked to pay for their degrees. The film begins with them handing over their child – and the first monthly payment for his care – to the family that responded to that advert in a dockside row of terrace houses in the outer reaches of east London. The scene raises many questions, most insistent of which is: what could they have been thinking?The film-maker has obviously given that question a great deal of thought. He says: “My understanding is that it derived from an age-old habit: in Nigeria – and elsewhere in Africa – it was common for parents to send their children from the village to a town, to an extended family member or even a stranger, because it was thought that child would have more opportunities.“The problems began with people like my parents because it was a foreign country. I think it was seen as a status thing – and there was an element of ‘white being seen as right’. Mostly they wanted us to get an education and learn to speak good English.”Because of the informal, under-the-radar nature of the practice, there are no figures for how many children were “farmed”, but Akinnuoye-Agbaje believes that well over half of all Nigerian British children would have experienced at least a few years away from their birth families in this way (he mentions the Olympic medallist Kriss Akabusi as somebody who has also spoken about it). The practice only really came to an end, he suggests, after stricter checks were put in place following the abuse and murder of Victoria Climbié in 2000. In the intervening years, however, few of the foster arrangements could have been as extreme as the environment in which the film-maker found himself.He was one of at least 10 Nigerian children taken in by his foster parents and mostly raised by his new mother, Ingrid (played in the film with abrasive spirit by Kate Beckinsale) while her husband was away working as a lorry driver. All those children fell to earth in Tilbury, a fertile recruiting ground for nascent far-right groups in the years after Enoch Powell made his “rivers of blood” speech. Akinnuoye-Agbaje and his new “siblings” – the family also eventually took in his two younger sisters – were initially the only black faces in their area.One of his first memories was starting school, he recalls. “The sun was shining and the first autumn leaves were beneath my shoes and I was walking with all the other kids to St Mary’s primary. A police car was on the side of the road and the policeman called me over. He half-smiled at me. And then he spat in my face and drove off. I looked around and the sun was still shining, children were walking by and I just remember that hot saliva on my face. I had to carry on going to school.”Akinnuoye-Agbaje’s foster parents told their children they were the just the same as everybody else, but at the same time they shared some of the racist attitudes around them. “What is incredible about this story,” he says, “is that it isn’t black and white. My parents would use racist slurs to us, but you would hear the same things on TV comedies it was the wallpaper of that time. That is not to excuse them. But one of the things I hope the film shows is that their initial intent to take on children was pure – my mother could not have children of her own – but over time there was a realisation that it was also a racket, and money could be made out of it.”As he grew older his mother encouraged him to shoplift for her, and just walking down the street was a trial: “You had dogs set on you, bricks thrown at you.”His father forced him back out on the streets to stand up to the bullies on his own: “There was no way of getting love. If all you have experienced is humiliation and rejection, and your foster father forces you to fight back or get a beating from him, you look for any kind of lifeline. There were only two options: fight, or become a victim. I tried the victim option for a long time.”Akinnuoye-Agbaje’s sense of dislocation was not helped when his birth parents, of whom he was hardly aware, abruptly arrived to take him with them back to Nigeria when he was eight or nine years old. From the streets of Tilbury he was suddenly transported to a traditional village. He was struck mute by the change. The solution his parents arrived at was to send him back to the same family in Essex where he now suffered an even greater identity crisis. In desperation he tried to scrub away at his skin to make it whiter. When that did not work, Akinnuoye-Agbaje adopted the only strategy for survival that seemed available to him. He made himself tougher and more fearless than his tormentors. At 16, expelled from school, he joined forces with them, becoming part of the skinhead gang that had once stripped and beaten him in the street.At first, he says he was treated as a weapon to be unleashed in turf battles with other gangs, or occasionally in racial assaults on black sailors in the docks. “It was not cosy at any moment. It was always a frenetic kind of tension, because an attack could have come from within or without at any time.”Did he shift the attitudes of the gang at all?“There was some respect, because I had bottle. I could take a beating and give one back,” he says. “But I was never anything like an equal. They were inquisitive about my hair, about my smell, about my skin. And there was a camaraderie in that we were all outsiders. Their fathers were drunks or unemployed. But every time I felt like I might belong I would abruptly be made aware that I was different. You would have an experience that would bond you, a fight, or even a joke, but then you were quickly made aware you were ‘the wog’, ‘the coon’.”When he first talked about these experiences in that previous Observer interview, some commentators on the story suggested that Akinnuoye-Agbaje misrepresented skinhead culture, that it was more racially nuanced than he argued and that his story was exaggerated. He laughs when I mention that criticism.“Had those people grown up in Tilbury? London was a so-called multicultural melting pot by the early 1980s. But on the outskirts, it was a very different story. Anybody who has those opinions I invite them to go back to Tilbury and be the only black kid in that school. It’s not that I want to say all skinhead culture was like that, but this particular group certainly was.”Some of the most extreme scenes in the film mix incidents that Akinnuoye-Agbaje heard about as well as experienced first hand. “The fights I was involved in were not fatal ones. But let’s be clear,” he claims, “several of the guys I was with six months later were dead, and they were dead because of hammers to the head or whatever. It was a very real world that I conveyed.”It was his foster mother who rescued him in the first instance. Unsure how to protect him from the gang, she contacted his birth family – and after one violent confrontation with his father (by now a successful lawyer in Nigeria) he was packed off to boarding school in Surrey. He first rejected that opportunity. Then, with the encouragement of a girlfriend and a teacher, eventually embraced education. He went on to study law at King’s College London.“People often ask me: how do you go from being a skinhead to having a bachelor’s and a master’s degree?” he says. He tells them: “Intelligence is the ability to make the most of your circumstances, whether you are on the street or in a university. The big help was a teacher who helped to translate the language of the law into a vernacular I understood. Once I got that, I was off to the races.” He laughs. “Obviously I had an intimate knowledge of breaking the law. My master’s was in criminal justice I did a thesis on the prison system.”It was at college that he was first spotted to do some modelling and a friend suggested he go to Los Angeles to try to launch an acting career. He went to an audition for a 1995 movie called Congo, and got the part roles in movies including The Bourne Identity and Thor and (as Malko) in the fifth season of Game of Thrones followed, along with Lost. “It was not until I was on set and saw what was involved that I knew that the sum total of my life had led to this. I was at home.”His broken family history was harder to resolve. Though he is now more in touch with his Nigerian heritage, he never discussed the horrors of his childhood with his birth parents. He says: “They just thought, ‘we did it all for you’. “I felt there was quite a bit of denial in that belief.”He talks a little about subsequent difficulties in establishing relationships of his own: “There was this theme of abandonment in my life, and subsequently you make sure you reject before you get rejected, you put a wall up.” He hasn’t ruled out marriage and children: “I am looking forward to that phase. I was 16 when this happened, I was 52 yesterday. I have had plenty of time to process it and my career as an actor has been a good tool for that. You can go through phases of bitterness and anger and hatred, but it has to have an expiry date, otherwise you are at a dead end.”He became a Buddhist 27 years ago, and has been practising a Japanese regime of chanting morning and evening for 15 years. He says: “It allows you to hear the inner voice and not the anger. Once I started listening to that voice that’s when I started writing.”The first scene that he wrote was a long imaginary conversation with his foster mother, with whom he had the complicated relationship at the heart of the film. Loyalty to your parents is a powerful emotion, and Akinnuoye-Agbaje has had far more reason to wrestle with it than most. That first conversation he wrote down was an attempt to capture all the conflicted feelings in that. He says: “You have to remember that, whatever the motivation, they were quite extraordinary human beings to take on 10 Nigerian children in a terraced house in Tilbury in the 1970s, where no one had seen a black child before. They were ostracised because of it. It wasn’t a picnic for them. I had to weigh all of that up.”They became closer in some ways after he became an adult and established a life for himself that no one had imagined. He says: “In the years before they passed, in 2006, they tried to spend more time with me. That was perhaps to make up for what they knew was a very tough upbringing. What I hope comes through is that despite everything they were to a large degree heroes to me. Flawed, but we all have parents that do both good and do bad.”Were they aware of the script and his ideas for the film, before they died?“They knew I was writing it, they had seen a short of it I made. My father said: ‘All you can do is tell the truth.’”What does he think they would have made of it? Would they have recognised themselves?“I’m sure they would. And I think they would have been quite proud to be honest,” he says.For himself, he hopes that now the film is done and out he can move on to directing other stories, in a different vein. His acting will continue, too, though I suggest there will never be a role to match that which he took on aged 16 in Tilbury. He smiles: “It’s true, I was acting my butt off every day just to stay alive. Those were the best performances I ever gave.”Farming is released on 11 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b2c1e9e3e82f51d8dabad491f38e38ef8494f35/0_205_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d14319974efb3f1a1f0c1de267ee7b21","title":"sweden norway finland italy euro 2020 qualifiers live","story":"Here’s a reminder of what happened yesterday, featuring some national anthem-based hilarity at the Stade de France: Nine changes for Spain – for whom anything other than a comfortable victory will be a deep and profound failure – and five for Italy, including goal-shy Ciro Immobile reinstated up front and the veterannovice pairing of Francesco Acerbi and Leo Bonnuci to keep guard of Teemu Pukki.Roll up, roll up!

Those youngsters have now grown up, but Raleigh is giving them the chance to relive their heady teenage years by relaunching the Super Tuff Burner once again. Complete with the original gold super chrome paint job, Aeroyal saddle, top-tube guard, looptail rear and five-spoke black Skyway Mag wheels, the limited-edition bike captures all the fun, spontaneity and excitement that the 80s bike provided. It’s difficult to act your age on a bike like this – but you can always pretend you’ve bought it to share with your kids. Be sure to make them watch ET first so they get to understand the context – though topping up on Stranger Things will work just as well. Interestingly, Raleigh expects the new generation of younger riders will want to get their hands on the Burner not only for its old-school thrills, but also because of its exclusivity. Its period details will turn heads in any BMX park – and you mighy even learn some new tricks, too.Email Martin at martin.love@observer or follow him on Twitter@MartinLove166 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

I help my daughter keep fit and that keeps me motivated. I love to box, so I’ll spend Sunday mornings at the gym, or training in my living room and also at the park.Breakfast or brunch? Usually neither, I’ll wait for lunch at 2pm. I love to go to my own restaurant for champagne and the beautiful roast chicken for two, or you’ll find me eating and sipping cocktails at Coal Rooms in Peckham, or with an ale at Pedler – being where everyone is treated like a friend.What’s on the radio?

There was always a crowd at our family home in Limoges, France. Sometimes we had small dinner parties, on other days there’d be 60 or more. The house was always open, and Mum is a wonderful cook, so the house was full of people and conversation – it shaped me.Do you work? Sometimes, if there’s an event or guests who I need to see.

Going more slowly will help you learn from past mistakesThe dilemma I’ve been in a relationship for four years. It started as a workplace affair, but we fell madly in love and knew we wanted to be together forever, which meant leaving our spouses. She went first, informing her husband their marriage was over. But she did not tell him about our affair. They agreed to separate and all was amicable. When I confessed, I was able to end my marriage, but not without difficulty and revenge acts. Neither of my children has spoken to me since, despite my efforts to reconcile. Three years later, my partner and I are still together. It’s mostly very good. My problem is that she retains a strong relationship with her ex. I understand this is good for co-parenting, but it makes me uncomfortable. She hasn’t orced him or made any effort to – even though I made a point of getting a orce to ensure a clean start. In contrast, my ex-wife and I have never been able to have a polite conversation. She is spiteful, vengeful and constantly asks for money. I appreciate my actions have had consequences. However, I struggle to manage my jealousy and fear my partner will return to her husband. It feels as if she is keeping her options open. Am I being irrational?Mariella replies Just a touch. You do seem to be ignoring the obvious, which is that your partner’s approach is netting positive results while yours has created only adversity. She’s engineered a departure low in acrimony while yours is marred by misery. I’d put money on your being one of those impetuous lovers who doesn’t like to let detail get in the way of an increased pulse rate. There’s certainly romance in the notion that the right two hearts would forever beat in unison and previous commitments were merely training for this, the real thing. It’s also a pretty naive stance to take.Rushing from one relationship to the next, swearing undying love and tying yourself up in hard to untangle commitments is beset with obvious flaws. It may play to your sense of insecurity to believe that your new partner is hedging her bets, but a better way to regard it would be with a degree of admiration for her superior wisdom. She’s managed to elegantly detach herself from her marriage without causing undue emotional misery and excess pain. Now she’s embarked on this relationship with you, but without the same determined disregard for past experience. Instead, she would appear to be carrying with her the lessons from her first foray that include the possibility, hard-earned, that wanting a relationship to last forever and achieving that goal are two separate and sometimes unreconcilable ambitions.For many, their first wide-eyed love affair will struggle to last the elongated journey that our increased lifes now provide. Sticking together for up to 80 years is a tall order and we could all do with lowering our expectations. The mistake you’re making, and it’s a common one, is to plough on without a moment to digest the experience you’ve just emerged from – which makes you the proverbial old dog! Your partner, on the other hand, seems to be proceeding far less impetuously, at the revised pace of one set on her path but mindful of the pitfalls. That does say something about her expectation of your relationship – not least that it’s imbued with the wisdom of past experience.Tying another inidual up in public statements of intent and transforming irrational impulses into set expectations doesn’t make it any easier to keep them on board – as both your exes have discovered to their emotional cost. The fact that you see your current partner making a similar commitment as the only way to feel secure about your hold over her deserves further scrutiny on your part. It suggests that what you are in pursuit of this time around is no more achievable than it was last time.I’ve no doubt your wife was furious you were breaking promises that she felt were non-negotiable. You’ve proved her wrong by leaving her and now you want your next partner to make those same unrequited promises all over again. Think about it – it really doesn’t make sense. Embarking on a relationship preoccupied with how swiftly you can create an inescapable institution doesn’t bode well for the success of the enterprise.Many of us will move on from relationships that aren’t perfect or have lost their allure over time, but life is supposed to be a learning process. I appreciate that the world today may not encourage belief in that concept – and your determination to declare your current pairing a “together forever” situation when you’ve already broken that promise once is just another indication that as a species, we still have a lot to learn. I suggest you enjoy what you’ve got – and when you are content enough not to care whether she commits publicly or not is the perfect moment to get remarried."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e614d848929b7f09c0f49adac7f95dcddd20ab20/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e52add7cd0e4c85d42ce7c84fdc96c5","title":"i know all their pet peeves why neighbourhood apps are a mixed blessing","story":"Sites such as Nextdoor are growing in popularity, offering the chance for people to get to know their neighbours. This can lead to friendship and community – but there are definite downsidesOne hot Wednesday morning in July, Bekky, a teacher from Horley in Surrey, put her two-year-old daughter into the back of her car and began the usual drive to work. “Then out of nowhere,” Bekky says, “this cat just banged into the side of my car.” She only knew the impact was a cat when she stopped and saw the animal in her wing mirror, staggering around on the asphalt.Worries tumbled through her mind. First, for the cat, which she thought had gone under the rear wheels. Then for its owner, and the slim chance of finding them in a hurry. She also worried that she could be held responsible for the cat’s injuries. A group of people watched from a bus stop down the road, until a bus arrived and took them away.Bekky found the cat under a bush, hurt but alive. “I didn’t want to leave it in that heat, but I had my daughter in the car, and no way of getting it.” In the end, Bekky was able to find the cat’s owner, a young woman who lived in a house nearby, who took it to a vet. Bekky spent an anxious day at work until news came that the cat would be OK. “I was a bit of a wreck,” she says. But that wasn’t the only news. “Someone from work sent me a WhatsApp message saying: ‘Is this you?’”Looking at the link, she saw a public post from the local Facebook page. It was addressed to “The lady driver of a blackdark grey Fiesta who struck a black cat”. “It was a gentleman who’d been at the bus stop,” Bekky says. “He was trying to reassure me that there was no way I could have stopped the car, because he’d seen the cat dart straight out.” Bekky joined the group, relieved, and replied that all was well, in order to prevent other cat-owners from worrying. Moments later, a stranger replied: “Wow Bekky, I wish you’d run over my cat!” After that, the praise and tributes continued for nearly a week. “I was like a celebrity,” she says. “I felt amazing.” But Bekky soon saw another side of her local group after the cat adventure faded from memory. Many posts were complaints, often about crime, and regularly naming one troublemaker in particular. “There was even a post where someone had taken pictures of a car in a driveway where they’d seen people having sex. It really is a Jeremy Kyle sort of page. It made me think that everybody’s watching.”Stories such as Bekky’s were almost impossible a decade ago, when social media had not yet linked strangers into local groups. Now, they happen every day, bad stories as well as good. This week in Perth, Australia, a vegan woman, Cilla Carden, was unsuccessful in taking legal action against her neighbours, who she claimed were deliberately barbecuing meat and fish in order to upset her with the smell. In response, someone created a Facebook event and 4,600 people said they were planning a ceremonial barbecue outside Carden’s house before the page was taken offline. Only social media makes it possible to bully on such a scale.When we asked readers to tell us how local social media had changed their neighbourhoods, we were flooded with responses. “I now know every single neighbour on my close on a first-name basis,” says Baljinder, 34, from Birmingham, who started an online neighbourhood watch group for her street of 27 families. She says that it is all very good-natured “apart from crap jokes in the WhatsApp group”.“The community will share food, residents offer furniture, we even had a mini-Olympics where we blocked off the street,” says Nicky, 41, about the Facebook group for her cul-de-sac. “All neighbours should do this for their streets.”People often get into local social media for practical reasons, but that is rarely where it ends. Raghaventra lives in an apartment block in Chennai, India, where he and others coordinate on WhatsApp to save water. “The WhatsApp group played a vital role in getting to know about my neighbours,” he says. At Kate’s block in Montreal, Canada, “people exchange clothing and toys outgrown by their kids, ask for recommendations for handymen or babysitters”, she says. “We know each other better and conversations flow easily when we meet during our daily life.”As a young person living in rural Northumberland, Harvey finds his local Facebook groups a lifeline when it comes to finding things to do. “It’s one of the main factors as to why I want to stay in the village and raise a family here,” he says. Chris in London says: “To be able to live freely and normally and also communicate with my fellow gay neighbours, it is beyond my wildest dreams. I couldn’t have managed to do that without technology and social media and it makes me happy, finally!”People don’t often talk about social media this way. Most public discussion seems to centre on whether it invades our privacy (it probably does) or harms our minds (it probably doesn’t), leaving little room for positivity, which is strange considering how much people seem to love using it. When the May government launched its loneliness strategy last October, the big idea was for GPs in England to start issuing “social prescriptions” for art clubs and walking groups, in the hope that they would help people build connections with their neighbours. Another plan was for the then ministers Tracey Crouch and Margot James to meet the big tech companies and “explore the impact technology has on loneliness and how they can help prevent it”. That’s “prevent”, you’ll notice, as if the impact must be bad.Local social media is often not anonymous, which prevents some of the abuses found on Twitter. At the same time, it feels like a more serious step to exclude someone from their neighbourhood group than ordinary social media. Nextdoor relies on a system of “lead” users to report problematic posts, which it then decides either to retain or remove. Lisher describes three basic rules to cover people’s conduct: “Be helpful, not hurtful”, “Don’t use Nextdoor as a soapbox” and “Promote business the right way”. It sounds simple, but Nextdoor’s moderation team is the biggest in the company.When Sian and her partner moved into their east London flat in March, they joined the Facebook group that had been set up to cover their block and three others nearby. They soon regretted it. Sian says a few people dominated the group with complaints about loitering teenagers, misuse of the lift and other minor matters. But the main problem was the bins, which the council stopped collecting, claiming that residents were leaving rubbish on the floor. The bin room grew fuller and smellier and the problem became a hot topic on the group, where many voices blamed other neighbours for being messy. One day, a post announced that a letter with a resident’s name and address on it had been found among some rubbish on the floor. They included a picture, adding, as Sian remembers it: “This is the person who is leaving their rubbish everywhere. They should be ashamed.”Sian was shocked, and said they should have approached the man privately before posting his name and address to the group, where he couldn’t defend himself because he hadn’t joined. “Do you want people knocking on his door?” she said. Sian remembers about four or five regular posters replying to say: “Well, why don’t you do something about it then, because you never do anything.”Perhaps the saddest thing about Sian’s case is that she and her neighbours were trying to be a community, but instead of bringing them together, Facebook pushed them apart. Six months after moving in, Sian feels that the group has permanently damaged her relationship with her fellow residents. “I wouldn’t say I know my neighbours,” she says. “All I know is what their pet peeves are. I’m sure if we bumped into each other in the hallway and we didn’t have this group, we could have a friendly conversation. But now, because of the group, I just want to avoid that.”Nor is her experience unusual. Deen from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, says that his neighbours, with the help of a new app, “are naming and shaming anything they don’t like about others”. Sometimes they add photographs and videos, he says.“People don’t seem to realise that social media defamation remains defamation,” says Kate, about her group in Johannesburg, South Africa.Disagreements are not likely to vanish from anybody’s neighbourhood. Nor is social media, but neighbours could certainly learn to use it better. Lisher suspects that people are often surprised by the different atmosphere that exists in local groups, compared with the bespoke list of friends and celebrities that they follow on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. “It’s not an echo chamber,” he says. “Suddenly you find that your neighbours voted differently than you in the EU referendum … It’s different in terms of the rules of engagement.”In truth, social media may or may not make us more neighbourly. But it does show us more clearly who we always were.Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8e7d9d37367fa3a368f538363bf038419d66f8e/0_0_1516_910/master/1516.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c8e70a06d3e5d3f03a9b1b30975b6eb","title":"what financial advice would you have given to your younger self","story":"From pension pots to property and investments, we asked three people with a wealth of experience what they wish they had known earlier on in lifeIt’s often said that we regret the things we didn’t do more than the things we did. The road not taken. But these regrets are typically rooted in explicit choices and decisions we’ve made. Often, however, we regret things that we weren’t even aware were options – the roads we didn’t know about. This kind of regret is particularly pertinent when it comes to managing our money. Although we make dozens of choices with our money every single day, we are blind to the options we didn’t even consider.For instance, even if we’re prudent enough to put some money aside instead of spending it on items we hardly ever use, we typically just stick it into a savings account. Or we put it into bricks and mortar. Many of us don’t even consider investing.Perhaps this is one reason why people who have successfully met some of their financial goals often credit the advice and wisdom of those with more experience. So what advice would people who’ve been there and done that give to their younger selves – and others?Debby Clarke, 54 bookkeeper, HarpendenMy advice would be to make an effort. I had no financial education whatsoever and I really wish I had. When I was growing up my dad handled the finances and my mum had nothing to do with them, so that set a sort of example. It didn’t help that when I met my future husband he was more clued up and I found it all a bit boring.Many kids still leave school without a clue now. As parents we took it on ourselves to explain things like budgeting, interest and credit to our daughter and that had the effect of making me make more of an effort.The other thing I’d tell myself is to start a pension sooner. I was in my late 30s when I took one out, but then we put all our money into getting on the property ladder, which I don’t regret. But I realise I should have invested a bit more for later in life now that I’m headed in that direction. I won’t be able to afford to retire early like my parents did, probably not at 65 either – but perhaps that’s not the worst thing.Trevor Levy, 55, financial adviser, LondonPensions seem a million miles away in your 20s and I was no different – even though I ended up working in the financial services industry. I was trying to get people to take out a pension but I didn’t have one of my own for a while. Now, I explain to people that pensions aren’t an older person’s thing. A pension is your long-term financial friend and I should have made friends sooner. People get obsessed by property but it’s about having a balanced set of options to cover all eventualities.Making money was seen as cool in the 1980s. Everyone was buying and trading shares. I didn’t know enough about it but I invested in a funeral firm. I thought: “There’s something that’s never going to run out of business” – but there was no plan and I didn’t hold them for very long. Everyone expected to make a quick buck in that era, but it doesn’t work like that. You need to take a long-term view and have a portfolio to spread the risk.Richard Southgate, 70, retired, MaestegOne piece of advice my dad gave me was: “Spend a bit, save a bit, make the devils wait a bit.” I didn’t quite heed my parents’ advice. There’s probably something in that. They knew stuff I didn’t. They were upper-working class and had to be careful with money.If I could do things again I’d have got on the housing ladder quicker. For my generation property has proved great value. Though obviously it’s much harder to get on the ladder these days.There was a tech boom a few years ago. I didn’t have a lot of money but I wanted to get in on it. I had a financial adviser and he said: “It’s too late, don’t bother.” I didn’t listen and lost a fair bit – so that was a salutary lesson. I have taken advice since and have done OK on the stock market. I learned to ride the ups and downs and take a long-term view. I use a technique known as pound cost averaging, which involves putting a few quid in each month, rather than investing a lump sum all at once. You can’t time the market – the ups and downs average out.Whatever your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

But with a bit of careful planning, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly thatPutting money aside – whether it’s for short-term goals or major life changes – can be difficult. There’s the unappealing prospect of forgoing stuff, toning down your social life, or taking on a side hustle. But with a bit of careful planning, and a clear goal to motivate you, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly that.To overcome the daunting prospect of putting away thousands of pounds, she broke her goal down into setting aside a few hundred pounds from her salary per month. When Sarah eventually started The Gluten Free Blogger alongside her day job, she set a new goal: to put away all the money she raised from the website. “It made it easier knowing I didn’t have to sacrifice everything and could still live my life, by funding my savings goal through a side hustle I was passionate about,” she says. Sarah’s savings plan was fairly traditional – using an ISA to build savings and putting away a little each month. Eventually, she shifted to a savings account that gave her better interest rates.Sarah recommends that anyone trying to save for a mortgage should set a monthly goal and stick to it. “I enjoyed being able to save and spend at the same time, but in hindsight it would have been nicer to commit a set amount each month and perhaps reach my goal a little quicker,” she says. Day-to-day she made small sacrifices, such as eating out less and forgoing takeaway coffees. She also decided to put off some overseas holidays until after she had raised her deposit. “As the end came nearer, it felt easier to somehow find the money.” Her next goal? Finding her dream home.She set up an investment portfolio and chose a lower-risk option. “I have always tended to take guidance and invested my money, I got an insurance policy paid out and it was all invested, for example.” Kay says that it was simple enough to amass the capital she needed to invest, by living a little more modestly. “It’s not the fact that I don’t like spending, but I’m just an ordinary, day-to-day person – I don’t yearn for fancy things,” she says. I’m very content. If I can live like I’m living now from today until tomorrow, I’ll be more than happy.”How to save to travel the world as a volunteerDorothy Selleck, 86, has spent 40 years travelling the world, volunteering in schools via the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education (OMEP). While she was still at university, Dorothy, who speaks Welsh as a first language in addition to multiple other languages, was approached by a friend who convinced her to use her skills in charity work. For weeks at a time, Dorothy would take time out from her job as a school’s inspector and visit places around the world, including Japan, India and South America. “We were still at our jobs – you couldn’t leave them for very long, but you could leave them for long enough,” she says.Dorothy paid her own way volunteering. Flights, accommodation, travel expenses and a membership fee to OMEP were funded through a full-time job and living a modest lifestyle. “I didn’t spend a great deal of money on myself,” Dorothy says. As well as setting up four separate savings accounts where she could budget her money for travel and day-to-day living expenses, Dorothy put some of her money into a house and approached HSBC for guidance on setting up an investment portfolio.Dorothy says being afforded the freedom to volunteer has allowed her to see hidden corners of the world and master three languages. Even now, long after her retirement 27 years ago she still volunteers at schools a few days a week – although much closer to home. “I’m still doing voluntary work,” she says. “It’s very important to me.”Top tips for saving for a major life goalInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.

The amount you have will determine what sort of plans you can turn into reality.Putting together a financial plan for each of these defining moments can give you greater freedom and choice. You’ll be able to enjoy each stage without worrying so much about money issues.If you are financially secure, you can take more informed decisions about moving jobs or changing career you may even get better deals on products such as mortgages and loans and you’ll have more time to spend on the things that matter to you – like leisure, travel and family.Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good financial planning. The good news is that it’s never too early or too late to start.You would imagine that you need a lot of money in order to start saving or investing. In reality, even relatively small sums can grow into a sizeable nest egg over time.The real secret of financial planning is making regular contributions and sticking at it over the long term. Building personal wealth is not a quick fix. Taking a lot of risk with your hard-earned cash in the hope of securing a short-term gain could be counter-productive.Instead, you should think of managing your money as a lifelong strategy and the key to future freedom, which can change and adapt as your personal circumstances change. When you are younger, you might take a little more risk and perhaps consider investing as a way of protecting your savings against inflation. In retirement you might need to think about how to protect your funds against sudden falls in value.Whatever age you are, the best way to start is to put away a bit of money at a time and allow interest to accumulate and investments to grow. If you save or invest into an inidual savings account (Isa), then everything you earn will be free of income and capital gains tax – giving your savings plan a boost.If you think of managing your money as the key to freedom, rather than a chore, you gain a new perspective on your finances. There are three key elements to planning for the big events in your life: setting goals, making it a habit, and reviewing your progress.What do you want to achieve with your savings and investments? Identifying a tangible goal – such as saving up a deposit for a home, being able to afford a wonderful honeymoon, or taking time off work after the birth of a baby – can be more motivational than having a vague idea of saving for some undefined future event. It’s important to have a rainy day fund first, for those unexpected events, so you won’t need to dip into your goal pots in troubled times.Now build in a timeframe – when will you need the money? What will you need to do in order to start saving? How much can you start with and could you make savings in your monthly spending in order to free up some spare cash? Small changes can make a big difference over the long term. For instance, if you have one less takeaway coffee at £3 a day, this equates to £15 a week, which over a year will amount to more than £700.If you have multiple goals, split your saving priorities into pots of money – short term, medium term and long term. Short term might be money for a fantastic honeymoon or overseas trip in a year or two medium term might be wanting to save for a house deposit over five or six years and long term will be your retirement planning.When you are clear about your goals and your timeframe, then you can start to think about the best home for your money.For funds you want to access within the next five years, you might consider a deposit account. You can make small incremental payments into a savings account or cash Isa. Moving money from your current account to a savings account on the day you get paid, or setting up a standing order, will mean you’re not tempted to spend it. However, as many of these are instant access, you’ll need to be disciplined about not touching it. If you think you might be tempted, consider a fixed rate savings product that locks your money away, often in return for a better interest rate.If your goal is five years or more away, you could consider investing in a variety of ways, at different levels of risk. Although these carry a higher risk than cash savings, they can also protect your money from the effect of inflation if your investments outperform the rate of interest offered by savings accounts. As you start this journey, it might be wise not to chase big wins or follow fashion – but instead to opt for a slower but safer approach, perhaps choosing funds that invest in a broad range of shares rather than trying to pick inidual companies. There are many sources of information about market trends, and it’s always good to become familiar with these.Any money you put into Pension savings has the benefit of being boosted by tax relief, but you can’t access the fund until you’re at least 55 and it’s best to wait until you retire. You should join a scheme at work if they have one, or save into your own private pension.It’s easy to start off with good intentions, and then forget to continue because of a lack of time or motivation.The key to successful money management is automating your financial commitments. Set up a regular amount to leave your bank account and be paid directly into your Isa or savings account. That way, the money has moved before you spend it, and you never have to set a reminder.Playing the long game can work in your favour, because the interest you build up in a deposit account will accumulate naturally. If you are investing for the long-term in the stock market, you’ll be less concerned with the short-term ups and downs of share prices. Sometimes people approach saving and investment in an emotional, rather than a rational way.It’s easy to buy shares when the stock market is doing well, and then panic after they have fallen. Try to take a long-term view, and check how your strategy is working for the long term, rather than from month to month. Remember: investments should be viewed as a five-year commitment, so make sure you think of these as a long-term strategy.Investments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.

For one thing, the money market rates that dictate the pricing of many savings products slumped to record lows this week.That would be great news for borrowers, but terrible for savers at a time when many older people appear to be using easily accessible savings accounts as a “safe haven” for pension cash.And perhaps we cannot completely rule out the possibility of interest rates going negative for savers in the UK, as they have done in European countries including Switzerland and Denmark, where some banks are now charging wealthy iniduals for looking after their cash instead of paying interest.Andrew Hagger at the financial website MoneyComms says: “It’s not looking good for savers at the moment.” Asked whether savings rates could potentially head towards zero, he says: “Potentially on some instant-access accounts, that could happen. If the base rate was cut, in some instances we could be heading towards zero or pretty close.”The move by NS\u0026ampI is especially notable because as well as being one of the UK’s biggest savings providers, it is also a government department.When we invest in NS\u0026ampI products, we are lending money to the government, and in return it pays us interest (or prizes for premium bond holders). But there is a big problem for savers: it is now cheaper for the government to raise cash on the money markets instead, which it does by issuing bonds.Sarah Coles of the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown says: “At the moment, the enormous uncertainty in the market means investors want bonds and are willing to accept low yields in return.”Rates might be falling, but Ray Boulger at the mortgage broker John Charcol – who tracks gilt yields – says that if you are a saver who has some money you don’t need right now, there is an argument for locking it up for a year or two on the basis that over the next few months, rates are more likely to fall than go up.So what can you do?• Consider an offset mortgage. If you have a mortgage, plus a decent amount in savings that you want to hang on to but is probably earning very little interest, it may be worth considering an offset home loan, says Boulger. These mortgages link your savings to your home loan, so your savings balance is used to reduce – or offset – the interest you pay on your mortgage.• Keep it in the family. Ultra-low interest rates may mean more loans and handouts from the Bank of Mum and Dad. “The lower the return you are getting on your savings, the more value there is in helping out a child or grandchild with a deposit,” says Boulger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea97fbb0b470bb96429be6b331dec085cd7bd7dc/0_227_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=676ccd75ff56d0b966b9ca94df322f0e","title":"rihanna lingerie savage x fenty victorias secret new york fashion week","story":"The star’s Savage X Fenty range is stealing the market from Victoria’s SecretFlesh rolls, stretch marks and dimpled thighs aren’t a traditional mainstay of New York fashion week, nor are lingerie shows ever deemed to have a finger on the pulse. But if the hype around Rihanna’s new collection is anything to go by, the industry is bracing itself for a wobble.This Tuesday the star, named the world’s richest female musician by Forbes, will be mounting her second Savage X Fenty show at an as-yet-to-be-disclosed Brooklyn venue. As per her debut last year, which was celebrated as a game-changing “festival of flesh of all skin tones” by Vogue, the spectacle is expected to be erse, inclusive and attended by fashion and celebrity A-listers.Last year Rihanna staged a direct assault on the traditionally hard-bodied, Barbie-doll aesthetic entrenched in the multibillion-dollar underwear industry by including plus size and pregnant models on her catwalk.This year she is making no bones about occupying the space created by the fast-declining but still dominant Victoria’s Secret. Rihanna’s event will be streamed on 20 September by Amazon Prime, and is expected to be aggressively marketed to its app users and customer base, propelling the viewership and sales far beyond the reach of any other show.After a 20-year tenure and posting its worst ever viewing figures last year, Victoria’s Secret’s annual show won’t be broadcast on television at all this year.The brand best known for its frou-frou polyester knicker sets and fairy wings has been battered by its association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who falsely posed as a model scout for the company. Epstein used his close friendship with Leslie Wexner, then head of the retailer’s parent company L Brands, to facilitate his alleged crimes against young girls. But mainly Victoria’s Secret has suffered for failing to adapt to social and consumer change, unable to influence the cultural zeitgeist in a way it once did.Rihanna’s vision for Savage X Fenty, which launched with more than 90 styles of bras, knickers, bodysuits, rompers and robes, has been designed by her for women like her – who, as she put it, might be “a curvy girl with thighs and a little bit of booty and hips”. The brand is speaking directly to a contemporary audience hungry for a less narrow and prescriptive representation of sexiness.Meanwhile, Victoria’s Secret has not hidden its debt to male fantasies. As noted by the Atlantic, its former president, Howard Gross, boasted of “never conducting any research into what actual women wanted from their underwear or their lives”. The company itself was founded in 1977 by a man named Roy Raymond who “imagined it as a haven for straight men, something more titillating than the mainstream department-store offerings but less salacious and fringe than sex shops”. The advertising campaigns and lingerie sets that followed were dreamed up from men’s sexual fantasies, rather than making any claim of “empowering” women through garters and bralets.Rihanna, who has sold 60 million albums and 215 million digital tracks, making her the biggest-selling digital artist of all time, has been lauded for her business prowess. She pivoted from pop music to cosmetics with Fenty Beauty in 2017. The range was met with hysteria: when it was launched in the UK exclusively at Harvey Nichols, queues formed around the block.Savage X Fenty, which announced a $50m round of new funding from backers last week, followed in 2018 and has cemented the 31-year-old’s reputation for immense savvy. Both brands have been actively designed, led and curated by Rihanna, whose authenticity and “BadGalRiRi” image remains a key part of her appeal.“Women should be wearing lingerie for their damn selves,” she said when the brand launched. “I can only hope to encourage confidence and strength by showing lingerie in another light. You don’t have to stick to one personality … I want people to wear Savage X Fenty and think: ‘I’m a bad bitch’.”Casting relatable women in beauty and lingerie campaigns, and offering products that cater to all body shapes and skin tones, and at affordable prices, may seem obvious, but it remains a groundbreaking model for the industry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d047228f36cfa9dab23b1ee6e8b91a6b33fb430a/0_147_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=235487267fee9f640498b8b9239ed869","title":"back to school after a decade of austerity podcast","story":"As the chancellor, Sajid Javid, gears up for what could be a pre-election spending review, education correspondent Sally Weale tells Anushka Asthana how nearly 10 years of government cutbacks in school funding have fed through to the classroom.

Rudd reacts to classic DomEven Theresa May didn’t lose ministers at this rate. Give it a couple of weeks and he’ll need a major reshuffle. Classic Dom.For Amber Rudd it was the morning after the night before on the Andrew Marr Show. Under the glare of the studio lights – far too bright, far too early, should have worn her shades – Rudd appeared furious. Mostly with herself. Trying to explain your lack of judgment was something better done in a confessional podcast than on a mainstream politics TV news show.“This is about trust, isn’t it?” Marr observed.“I’m not going to use that word,” Rudd replied defensively.Only she couldn’t actually come up with any better word to describe the reason for her resignation. The bottom line was that she had been taken for a mug. She’d allowed her desperation, her neediness, to get the better of her. She’d chosen to believe a serial liar just to extend her career by a couple of months.Not that she was going to accuse Johnson of lying either. More that he was pathologically unable to tell the truth. The tipping point – the Damascene conversion – had come when Philip Hammond, Ken Clarke, Justine Greening and others had been slung out of the Tory party for doing what Jacob Rees-Mogg had done hundreds of times. Then she had demanded to see what progress the government was making, she had been told that preparations were the sort of thing that “girly swot” David Cameron did and had been palmed off with a single piece of paper on which was written, “tHe UK Is gRAte. We iS goNNa maKe veR EU eet shiT”.Thereafter, the interview had all been downhill with Rudd firmly on the defensive. No, she didn’t really know anything. She didn’t know if the prime minister was going to obey the law. She couldn’t say whether other ministers, such as Matt Hancock and Nicky Morgan, might also one day discover they were vertebrates after all. She couldn’t even be sure who exactly was running the Conservative party. She just wanted a long lie-down in a darkened room. Thankfully, there would be plenty of time for that in the coming weeks.Just what the government was planning on doing in the next two months was no clearer when Marr interviewed Sajid Javid. The chancellor has been under virtual house arrest since his appointment, with speeches cancelled and his dispatch box appearances limited to walk-on cameos that everyone ignored. With good reason. Because, like Johnson, Javid isn’t actually very good. Unable even to command a veneer of competence.He, too, knew nothing about anything. He couldn’t say how the prime minister was going to perform the mutually exclusive acts of complying with the law and asking the EU for an extension and breaking the law by refusing to ask for an extension. And all he could say about the government’s plans to get a deal was that Stella McCartney had been commissioned to design some stunning uniforms for the badger patrols on the Northern Ireland border."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf36255ac157ed4ad5060bb84b95627300b9412e/0_113_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a35f7424e620fb8190b3fbf97abba72","title":"call to cancel dominic cummings commons security pass","story":"MPs demand to know why Boris Johnson’s aide has access despite being in contempt of parliamentSenior MPs have demanded to know why Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s adviser, has been granted a security pass for the Palace of Westminster even though he has been found in contempt of parliament.The former head of the Vote Leave campaign, who is now employed inside No 10, was sanctioned in March this year for failing to appear before the digital, culture, media and sport committee’s inquiry into fake news. MPs on the Commons committee of privileges found that his refusal to give oral evidence constituted a significant interference in the work of the inquiry.Damian Collins, chair of the media committee, said at that time that Cummings had shown a “total disregard” for the authority of parliament and called for statutory powers to “reassert the authority that is missing”.Cummings, now employed as a special adviser to Boris Johnson, was seen in parliament several times last week as a cross-party group of MPs seized control of the parliamentary timetable. They tabled a bill to force Johnson to ask the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline from 31 October to 31 January, if no agreement has been reached with Brussels by the middle of next month.At one point last week Cummings reportedly confronted Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, in parliament and challenged him over whether he would support a general election to break the deadlock over Brexit.A highly isive figure, Cummings was also at the centre of a row within government when he sacked Sonia Khan, a special adviser to the chancellor Sajid Javid, without the chancellor’s knowledge, and then asked an armed police officer to march her out of Downing Street.Last night Steve Doughty, a Labour member of the home affairs select committee, tabled a series of parliamentary questions asking the House of Commons Commission, which has responsibility for granting access to parliament, “whether iniduals who have been found in contempt of parliament are eligible for Commons security passes” and on what grounds Cummings was granted one.Kate Green, the chair of the Commons privileges committee, said her committee was already looking into whether “the powers and sanctions” that the House has in such cases were adequate. “We are currently conducting an inquiry into precisely this question,” Green said.Doughty said last night: “Serious questions must be answered as to how an inidual found in contempt of parliament, and over whom other allegations hang unanswered and unresolved, can be wandering around the parliamentary estate at will.“Of equal importance the public have the right to know whether such an inidual, at the heart of government, with access to the PM and potentially highly confidential papers and communications – has received the appropriate level of security clearance.”Asked about Cummings’s access to parliament and the level of security checks he had undergone, a Cabinet Office spokesman said: “It would be inappropriate for us to comment on an inidual’s employment.”Special advisers are bound by the same standards of integrity and honesty required of all civil servants, as set out in the Civil Service Code.The abrasive and unorthodox approach of Cummings has caused consternation in parliament, with former prime minister John Major among his growing number of critics. Last week Major warned that Johnson’s advisers could “poison the political atmosphere beyond repair”.Roger Gale, a senior Conservative MP, went further last week, dismissing Cummings as “an unelected foul-mouthed oaf” for his role in the prime minister’s deeply contentious decision to suspend parliament for five weeks, call for a snap election and withdraw the Tory whip from grandees including Winston Churchill’s grandson Sir Nicholas Soames."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e5e1649c46ed0ae75746aceb0acb93d7b49ad32/21_39_1529_917/master/1529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dcb24b5e90e4502a2e0163b08d7ab94","title":"tories contest speaker john bercow seat breach convention andrea leadsom brexit","story":"Andrea Leadsom says Speaker ‘failed’ by allowing move by MPs to block no-deal BrexitThe Conservatives will field a candidate against the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, at the next general election, Andrea Leadsom has said.The business secretary revealed the move, a breach of longstanding convention, as she stepped up her feud with Bercow, accusing him of breaking the rules of parliament by allowing MPs to take control of Commons business.In a stinging attack, Leadsom said Bercow had failed in his role and had permitted a “flagrant abuse” of parliamentary process. She said the Conservative party would field a candidate in Bercow’s constituency of Buckingham at the next election as a result.The Speaker of the Commons is an MP and stands in general elections but is usually unopposed by the major political parties. “Give us back an impartial Speaker,” Leadsom said. Her comments come days after MPs backed a motion to take control of the Commons timetable to pass legislation to block a no-deal Brexit.Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Leadsom said the Speaker’s role was to be “a politically impartial, independent umpire of proceedings” who was in place “to protect the constitution and oversee the behaviour of the house”.“But last week, the current Speaker failed us,” she wrote.Leadsom said by allowing MPs to use standing order No 24 – a procedure used to trigger emergency debates – as a means of taking over parliament’s timetable, Bercow had not “just bent the rules, he has broken them”.She added: “What we saw on Tuesday was a flagrant abuse of this process. The standing order No 24 that the opposition proposed wasn’t appropriate for a motion. It was intended to ram through legislation for purely political motives.”She said using the standing order in such a way would lead to the creation of “bad laws” and showed “complete disregard to the will of the people”.Leadsom, who served as leader of the Commons for almost two years, has clashed with Bercow in the past. In May last year the Speaker was alleged to have labelled her a “stupid woman”. In March, Bercow reprimanded Leadsom for using her mobile phone during Commons business, while Leadsom later accused the Speaker of failing to show MPs “courtesy and respect”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20f844a77d8f5cc6eacb73dfe86dc330bab500fc/0_332_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=627662f043a69e4b0d7bfae62ace813d","title":"tory mp andrew griffiths cleared of wrongdoing for sending explicit texts","story":"Watchdog finds no evidence Andrew Griffiths sent messages while engaged in parliamentary activityA Conservative MP who bombarded two young women with lewd text messages has been cleared of wrongdoing by the parliamentary standards watchdog.Andrew Griffiths, 48, resigned as minister for small business last July after it was revealed he had sent 2,000 sexual texts to Imogen Treharne, a barmaid, and her friend in just 21 days, weeks after the birth of his first child.The watchdog said it had not found evidence that the Burton and Uttoxeter MP sent the messages while engaged in parliamentary activities and allegations that he breached the House of Commons code of conduct were not upheld.Griffiths is said to have bombarded Treharne, 28, and her friend with messages in which he referred to himself as “Daddy” and asked for explicit photos.A resolution letter said: “Mr Griffiths’ conduct has undoubtedly damaged his own reputation, as well as his health and family relationships.

Why?There’s a factory in Asia that uses only a single litre of water to make a pair of jeans. That’s 346 litres less than Levi-Strauss estimated it took to make a pair of its jeans in 2015. Wouldn’t you love to buy your jeans from this amazingly innovative factory? Me too, but I don’t even know what it’s called.The manufacturer in question does not want to tell anyone about its groundbreaking water-conserving techniques – not even the companies it supplies. It is one of many practising “secret sustainability”, whereby innovations are silently enacted and kept from the rest of the industry.Why would firms spearheading sustainable practices not publicise their good work? It’s a question that puzzles Professor Steve Evans, director of research in industrial sustainability at Cambridge University’s Institute for Manufacturing, who suggests that such examples are widespread. He believes this stems from a common perception that there must be some kind of downside to the introduction of sustainable practices: either a reduction in product quality, or an increase in the price of manufacturing, or both. In the case of the Portuguese wineries, both already had good reputations for quality. All they wanted to do was to keep giving consumers great wine at a good price, without degrading their soil. They hadn’t increased the cost of making wine as they shifted to organic practice. Their management was concerned that introducing the organic designation would lead consumers to question the quality of their wine. They also feared that if they raised their prices to meet the expectation that organic wine costs more, they risked making their wine unaffordable to their current customers. Why rock the boat? Consumers seem to believe that products cannot become more sustainable without becoming more expensive. So anything to the contrary is met with suspicion.Evans claims that, in business-to-business transactions, there may be even less incentive to advertise sustainable practices. Suppliers fear that talking to their price-sensitive business customers about sustainable changes could be seen, at best, as a meaningless distraction when management should be focused on quality and, at worst, as a signal that costs are about to go up. For companies championing a given innovation, it’s an unnecessary risk: you are unlikely to get any other business customers to sign up based on your sustainability credentials, but you might spook those who fear an increased cost being passed on to them. So best to stay quiet.All these factors combine to create countless industries where pioneers are creating solutions to reduce environmental harm but are leaving other industry players and consumers in the dark. Evans says: “When we started our research 15 years ago, we believed the problem was that we didn’t have enough examples of sustainable industrial practices for others to follow.”But he and others at the institute have now found that even with the examples they have been able to share, companies and consumers seem unable to accept that sustainability does not have to cost more to create an equally good product. Apparently, we simply cannot believe that a business can be equally or more profitable while reducing its environmental harm. This is despite an increase in evidence that actively investing in sustainable practices helps business thrive. An example is provided by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, a series of benchmarks assessing the sustainability of companies around the world. Research has repeatedly shown that those at the top end of the benchmark outperform those at the bottom.Libby Peake, senior policy adviser at Green Alliance, an independent thinktank and charity that focuses on environmental leadership in industry and government, agrees. She says: “We know that the best manufacturers are improving their energy efficiency about five times faster than the average company. These leaders have vital lessons to share with the laggards, so it’s a sad state of affairs if they feel they cannot boast about their achievements. We need to see sustainable goods and services move to the mainstream instead of being hidden in the shadows.”This belief persists despite more sustainable and resource efficient businesses demonstrating clear competitive advantages.Evans is collaborating with psychologists from Cambridge University on research to change the public’s belief about the expense and quality of sustainable products.“The hardest thing to change is your mental model – your belief about how the world works,” says Evans. It seems tackling some of the biggest environmental problems in industry is not as hard as getting people to change their minds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/512b222f10a39630393283445122ea14ee63281e/0_271_4976_2985/master/4976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33a0b696ecabc6d96f6fc9da99e30719","title":"england australia retain ashes fourth test day five report","story":"They came in their thousands hoping for more miracles. The trouble is that this England side is starting to depend on miracles, which is rarely a fruitful state of affairs. There was some admirable graft from most of the England players that triggered hope among the optimists. But there was no miracle. At 6.15pm Australia won the Test by 185 runs and thereby retained the Ashes. Mission accomplished for Justin Langer, Tim Paine and their team. Now they turn their attention to gleaning more points in the World Test Championship. That is all England can do as well.England were worn down by the persistence and skill of one of Australia’s best attacks. The best of them was Pat Cummins. But for the stupendous feats of Steve Smith he would be the obvious pick as the man of the series. He is the only one of Australia’s pacemen to play in every Test and it is easy to understand why. He has hardly bowled a poor spell. Beset by injuries in his youth, when he was branded the best-paid student in the country (Cricket Australia had already put him on a central contract) he is now a man mountain, solid as a rock physically and temperamentally.Cummins bowled the decisive over of the match on Saturday night when he dismissed Rory Burns and Joe Root with successive deliveries. On Sunday morning he was the man to set the ball rolling for the Australians when dismissing Jason Roy and Ben Stokes in his second spell. He has 24 wickets in the series, five more than his nearest rival, Stuart Broad, and he has been miserly as well.But even Cummins had to wait for an hour and 20 minutes before separating the overnight batsmen. Roy steeled himself to play a knock appropriate to the situation, covering his stumps, pushing forward and almost smelling the ball as he blocked full-length deliveries that he might well have stroked to the boundary in an ODI. Less surprisingly, Joe Denly sidled back and across before defending with the straightest of bats. Against Lyon he employed the slog sweep regularly and usually middled the ball. Both batsmen enhanced their modest reputations as Test batsmen.Then Cummins propelled another in-ducker that beat the inside edge of Roy’s bat before demolishing his stumps. Stokes emerged determined to defend stoically, which he managed for 16 balls, a caged lion. To his 17th he made a late decision to withdraw his bat against Cummins, too late since the ball brushed the toe of the blade, which prompted Stokes to walk off without waiting for any decision from umpire Marais Erasmus.After lunch Denly reached his third Test half-century but soon he gloved a turning delivery to short-leg off Lyon. Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler hinted at something substantial until the first ball after a drinks interval. Mitchell Starc had been recalled after the batsmen had been lulled by a few overs from Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne. His first ball thudded in to the pads and Bairstow had to go.Now Craig Overton dug in alongside Jos Buttler he was given lbw but survived after an agonisingly long review. Together they batted another 15 overs until the tea interval when England were 166 for six. By now there had been a ball change and the replacement seemed more prone to move. Six overs into the final session Buttler fell, bowled playing no shot to a fine delivery from Hazlewood that jagged back on to the off stump. Buttler has batted with much self-denial in this series and this has been his most productive Test so far but it would be a relief to see him bat with freedom before the series is out.Jofra Archer fell in the next over, lbw to a scooter from Lyon, and the game was surely up. Now there was another change to the batting order. Out came Jack Leach rather than Stuart Broad and the ploy was a limited success. The bespectacled left-hander dug in alongside his Somerset teammate he dealt with the second new ball with considerable aplomb and an enthralled crowd cheered the completion of every over. Leach survived for 15 overs he had played Lyon with such composure that Tim Paine tossed the ball to Labuschagne. A leg-break gripped and was punched to short-leg by Leach.England had made it to the last hour but no further. Two overs later Overton, who had battled away for 104 deliveries, was lbw, half-forward to Hazlewood and his review was futile. The Australians celebrated joyously and with good reason. It had been a hard slog the Headingley match represented an almighty blow to the solar plexus. But they never fell into the trap of feeling sorry for themselves they kept their resolve superbly and had thoroughly outplayed England in yet another gripping Test match.Obviously Smith and Cummins have been the key architects of this victory and the retention of the Ashes. But kudos must also go to Paine. As captain he carries the can when it all goes wrong. In this series he was given flak whenever England escaped or he failed with the bat but he has remained calm except for a few dizzy DRS moments his team has busted guts throughout the fielders were always effervescent and clung on to most of the catches that came their way. The pace bowlers were unrelenting. And it was quite a good idea to toss the ball to Labuschagne when Leach was digging in. Moreover Paine’s side has been aggressive throughout without ever crossing that much-discussed line. Australia have been the better team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d927d358afc83ae3cc1fe5b641aea20b06af49b/85_0_4596_2758/master/4596.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1662f9c510d6a7be680f3ff87308c8a4","title":"ferrari charles leclerc italian f1 gp monza win","story":"The first win in Formula One is a moment that remains indelibly etched on a driver’s mind. For Charles Leclerc who triumphed at the Italian Grand Prix, it is this, his second victory, that will surely be the one that stays with him throughout his life. The 21-year-old’s joy was writ large across his still boyish face as he stood on the podium confronted by a sea of red as the tifosi erupted in a collective celebration of colour, noise and, it must be said, some relief.Leclerc, at the centre of this ecstatic maelstrom, absorbed their approval as flags and red flares battled for space in the air beneath him, as an emperor surveys his subjects. Last week his debut victory at Spa was tempered by the death of his friend Anthoine Hubert in an F2 race in Belgium. There had been pleasure in his maiden win but delivering here for Ferrari in their home race, the joy was unconfined for him, his team and their fans.It was impossible not to sense that for everyone wearing red at Monza a great weight had been lifted from their shoulders. Ferrari have not won at home since Fernando Alonso did so here in 2010. This weekend history, always hard to escape here and with this team, had too brought expectation, as it was the 90th edition of the Italian Grand Prix and the 90th anniversary of the foundation of Ferrari in 1929.Leclerc took the win from pole but had anything but a serene run to the flag. He was pushed by Lewis Hamilton for the first two-thirds of the race as the British driver put in everything to try to pass him. He could not quite make it however with the Ferrari having a distinct edge in pace and, having used up his tyres in the attempt, Hamilton finished third behind his teammate Valtteri Bottas.It was a deserved win although not without controversy as Leclerc very decisively got his elbows out in defence of his lead. The five-time champion and the young pretender put on a fine fight at the front.Leclerc held his lead through the pit stops after which Hamilton, on softer rubber, charged at him. They went wheel to wheel approaching the Roggia chicane and as Hamilton went to pass, the pair touched and the championship leader was forced wide. Hamilton claimed Leclerc had not left him a full car’s width as required. The stewards issued only a warning and Leclerc held his own in that he would be no pushover.It was controversial and clearly the two differed in their interpretation of the incident afterwards, Hamilton saying the stewards’ decisions lacked consistency.Hamilton continued to harry him and on lap 36 Leclerc locked up at the first chicane and cut the corner, coming back on having just held his lead. The incident was noted but no action was taken.It had cost him time, however, and Hamilton took advantage and went at him again when Leclerc moved defensively on the approach to Roggia. Leclerc’s move was robust and fearless but again may have been interpreted differently, Hamilton describing it as “dangerous” over team radio.Hamilton’s efforts had also cost him. With his tyres gone, he locked up and ceded second to Bottas who went after Leclerc but could not close the gap.When the season began, Leclerc was firmly the No 2 driver to his teammate Sebastian Vettel. He is now in front of him in the championship. Here he laid down a marker as the top man at the team while Vettel put in another performance he will want to forget.On lap six the German lost his rear and  at Ascari. He then hit Lance Stroll’s Racing Point as he rejoined. It was exceptionally dangerous and sent Stroll into a spin as well. The incident was immediately investigated by the stewards and Vettel was penalised with a 10-second stop-go penalty, with which he might feel he escaped lightly before finishing in 13th.Fortunately Ferrari still had Leclerc to bring it home and he did so with aplomb. Cheered to the rafters for every lap, Leclerc held his place and with it the lifelong admiration of the tifosi, whose chanting of his name will surely stay with him forever.The championship nonetheless remains firmly in Hamilton’s hands. The British driver leads Bottas by 63 points with Max Verstappen 99 points back in third. Leclerc is now fourth, three points behind Verstappen.The two Renaults of Daniel Ricciardo and Nico Hülkenberg were in fourth and fifth. Verstappen, starting from 19th after an engine change, was eighth. Alexander Albon was sixth for Red Bull, with Sergio Pérez seventh for Racing Point. Alfa Romeo’s Antonio Giovinazzi was in ninth, in front of the McLaren of Lando Norris."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e6e60866a846602bad5c9ef71608ff3c94dffa3/0_31_4098_2459/master/4098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b01a34b87ffb2047db47875e93c218ce","title":"lewis hamilton to have a word with charles leclerc after monza f1 incident","story":"Lewis Hamilton has called for consistency in penalty decision-making in Formula One, after he felt Charles Leclerc had not obeyed the rules during his victory at the Italian Grand Prix. The Mercedes driver insisted Leclerc, who took his second win for Ferrari at Monza, had deserved the success but also said he may speak to the Monegasque driver in private about what had happened on track.Leclerc took the win after the two drivers had enjoyed a long battle. It had come to a head at the Roggia chicane where Hamilton looked to pass but Leclerc squeezed him wide. Hamilton believed he had not been left a car’s width of space as the regulations require but Leclerc was issued only with a warning. Hamilton said that had he not ceded the position they would have clashed and specifically referenced the car’s width regulation.“We’ve just constantly asked for consistency,” said Hamilton of the stewards. “There was a rule put in place, and then it wasn’t abided by today. They used different consequences for the rule today. I don’t know why that was the case. I guess the stewards woke up on a different side of the bed this morning, I don’t know.”Leclerc believed he had left enough room and explained his driving style had been influenced since he was beaten by Max Verstappen at the Austrian Grand Prix earlier this year. At Spielberg Verstappen passed him up the inside, making contact, forcing Leclerc wide and he lost the place. After a long inquiry Verstappen’s move and win were allowed to stand.“I think since Austria it is clear you can go a bit further in the way we defend and overtake and the aggressiveness of us drivers,” he said. “I believe that Austria helped me to change this approach and today, it’s also thanks to this that I managed to win. It was obviously very on the limit but I’m happy to race like this.”Hamilton in turn noted that he too would adjust his decision-making accordingly now he had been on the receiving end but insisted there was no lack of respect between him and the 21-year-old.“He did a fantastic job today. I put on as much pressure as I could,” he said. “We had a couple of close moments, I think we can probably talk about it in private together, but there’s nothing major, and we continue to race. I’m looking forward to more races together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af00cb3db1af04640d126aecb79f57cfd04b9767/964_16_2745_1647/master/2745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee061943c673bb766c15b7a0d87143cb","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia fourth test day five live","story":"England dug in on the final day at Old Trafford but it was not enough as Australia completed victoryAnd that is the end of that chapter. Thanks for joining everyone that was involved today.Here is the match report. Sky are now just going through the wickets again, which is pretty painful. My brother was at Old Trafford today and they ran out of John Smith’s, which is a shame. Luckily he only drinks Pimms. Is Ollie Pope the next cab off the rank? Does Dom Sibley merit a go as he has actually scored some runs this season? After that, the options are not great. Liam Livingstone, maybe? Hussain points out that Roy opening was a poor decision on the selectors’ part. Now he is questioning the dropping of Woakes for this Test. He has not had a great series but his stats in England are incredible. He is averaging 22.78 with the ball. Beefy and Ponting also say it’s rather silly to leave Woakes out. Who will replace Roy in the next game?Botham slags off the Kookaburra ball, adding how much better Dukes balls are. So there is one victory for England. Phil Town says: “It has to do with talent, sure, but also hunger. Who was hungrier? Who wanted this more?”Plenty of England players seem to have eaten plenty, it would seem. Langer revealed in his chat that he sat the team down to watch the final stages of the loss at Headingley. Some might have viewed it from behind the sofa but maybe it was quite a cathartic experience. Will England watch back some of their dreadful shots throughout the series?Thanks for your contribution, John.Justin Langer speaks: “It’s been an unbelievable series and it’s great for Test cricket. “We have the No 1 fast bowler in the world and the No 1 batsman in the world. I thought Virat Kohli was the best batsman I’ve ever seen but I think Steve Smith is another level. “We haven’t been great at winning away for some time, so winning away from home with such a way from home is really important for this group.“This has been the most challenging week of my coaching career and now the most rewarding.”Langer is now off for a beer. Needless to say, Steve Smith win’s Man of the Match. People still booing him!“I didn’t enjoy sitting and watching last week, that’s for sure,” Smith says. “To know that the urn is coming home is an incredibly special feeling. “It’s been a good series, I’ve really enjoyed my time in the middle, I’ve worked very hard. I want to be the man in the middle doing the best for my team. I don’t like watching cricket, so I’d rather be out there in the middle.“I’ve got two hundreds in two games at The Oval, so it’s a place I do like batting. We didn’t come here to just retain the Ashes, we came here to win it.”Tim Paine: “I am pretty pumped. This team has been through a lot in the last 12 to 18 months, some iniduals more than others. “I was really proud how our bowlers stuck at it. We were trying to stay calm, but it’s not always easy in that situation. I am really pumped for the boys to get it won.“We’ll enjoy tonight but we came here to win the series not just retain the Ashes.”It’s the presentations ...A rather emotional Joe Root: “I thought we show greater fight and belief in what we wanted to achieve.“We always believe and make sure we fight to the end. “You can always sit back and look back at different areas of how you could do things differently. “Everyone stood up and played bravely. “We’ve seen some wonderful test cricket this series and I expect the same at The Oval. It’s tough to lose but we have to pick ourselves up and get ready for The Oval.”We are having a lovely montage to remind us of some woeful England shots. At least we can hold on to the fact that the Australia openers are terrible, right? Paine has got a few things wrong over the series when it comes to his bowlers but bringing on Labuschagne was a certainly a critical decision he got right. He saw the conditions and backed his part-time leggie to get the job done and did so with a lovely ball into the footmarks.Gower is trying to find some positives ... mainly focusing on Denly getting a few more runs. I am not sure he is exactly the future and the rest of the batting lineup have plenty of questions to answer. Can Roy survive for another Test? Will Buttler be replaced?You cannot underestimate how important that first over was last night from Pat Cummins, as without those early wickets England might have had a chance. Josh Hazlewood says Australia will be going to win the series in the next Test, which is the sort of attitude required. Will they come up against a much changed England side? Marnus reacts: “I was actually at the top of my mark and I said ‘just trust it, spin it hard’ and I got the length right. It bounced up and struck Leachy’s gloves.As Rob said, Australia have been the better throughout the series and merited the victory.Steve Smith reacts to the victory: “It feels amazing to know the urn is coming home. “It’s always been one to tick off the bucket list to take the urn back home from England.“They fought incredibly hard, I thought Overton was excellent at the end.”There was a lovely moment as Australia watched the replay, waiting for confirmation that Overton was out. Steve Smith was hopping around nervously, of course he was. The rest were perfectly still – and then it was confirmed, and they all went ballistic. They deserve to celebrate exceptionally well tonight, and they will.England almost stole a draw, but it would have been a travesty. Australia have been much the better team in this series - they have an awesome, relentless bowling attack and a supernatural batsman, and they fully deserve their first retention of the Ashes since December 2002. I have to go and do newspaper stuff, so Will Unwin will talk you through the reaction. Thanks for your company and emails, and congratulations to Australia. Night!WICKET! England 197 all out (Overton LBW b Hazlewood 21) They’ve done it! It was a lovely delivery from Hazlewood, a big nipbacker that hit Overton in front of middle stump. Height was the only thing that might have saved him - but it was hitting the top of the stumps.OVERTON IS GIVEN OUT LBW AND REVIEWS! I think this is out. It was a token review.91st over: England 197-9 (Overton 21, Broad 0) Broad does survive the last two deliveries. Labuschagne, his work done, is going to be replaced by Josh Hazlewood.90.4 overs: England 197-9 (Overton 21, Broad 0) Overton has been heroic in defence. But he now needs to find a way to farm the strike he takes a single off the fourth ball of Lyon’s over.90th over: England 196-9 (Overton 20, Broad 0) The No11, Stuart Broad, has one ball to survive from Labuschagne. He should just run at the ball so it hits him outside the line. In fact it’s a full toss, which Broad defends. The last hour begins, with 15 overs remaining.Brilliant captaincy from Tim Paine! Labuschagne got one to spit from the rough at Leach, who could only fence it to Wade at short leg. It was the bounce that did for him. He walks off looking desolate, having fought so hard for 51 balls.Now then: Marnus Labuschagne is coming on to bowl some legspin. That’s not a bad idea, with the ball kicking out of the rough to the left-handed Leach. And the gamble has worked!89th over: England 196-8 (Overton 20, Leach 12) Starc replaces Cummins, who gave everything in that short spell. Starc is the freshest of the Aussie bowlers, in the context of both the match and the series, and a specialist at blasting out tailenders. Overton is better than that, a good No8 at Test level, and he calmly survives another six deliveries. It’s been a heroic innings of 20 not out from 98 balls. There are 16 overs remaining, light permitting.88th over: England 196-8 (Overton 20, Leach 12) Lyon beats Leach with a textbook, flighted off-break. Gorgeous bowling. Leach is beaten again, trying to cut the last ball - a rare poor stroke is a fine defensive innings. Another maiden. (Ignore the change in score, I missed a run somewhere.)87th over: England 195-8 (Overton 20, Leach 12) A short ball from Cummins hits Overton on the arm. That gives the physio the chance to walk down the steps. “Easy does it on those stairs - health and safety,” says Nasser Hussain on commentary. Overton actually tells the physio to stay by the boundary edge. We must be due a drinks break soon as well. It’s getting very heated, and not just on Jack Leach’s glasses.Cummins is ramming almost everything into the pitch now, prompting a few pantomime boos from the crowd. He beats Overton with a length delivery - but it’s a no-ball, which is good for Australia. They get an extra delivery more importantly it’s a warning for Cummins to watch his front foot because they will check if he takes a wicket. Overton survives the remainder of the over - 18 to go, and there’s a pulsating atmosphere at Old Trafford.“You can never stop,” says Niall Mullen. “You’re our liveblog Sisyphus. Every time you roll the OBO up one side of the hill it just rolls down the other side...”There’s no cap on playing time, unless bad light stops play. Craig Overton has a change of bat, which takes up a minute or so. I suspect we’ll get at least 12 of the remaining 19 overs, if necessary. But this might not take long, because Cummins has gone to a whole new level of nastiness.86th over: England 195-8 (Overton 20, Leach 12) Lyon replaces Hazlewood, with six men round the bat. Leach survives a hopeful LBW appeal from a ball that straightened - but only after pitching outside leg stump. After that he defends solidly, and it’s yet another maiden. Nineteen overs to go.“This is, of course simultaneously unbearable and brilliant,” says Guy Hornsby. “I can’t take much more so I’m going for a run with TMS on, one that was supposed to be calming me down after our inevitable pre-tea capitulation. We all know that it’s still not going to happen but.... oh CRICKET.”85th over: England 195-8 (Overton 20, Leach 12) Tim Paine puts his around Cummins’ shoulder, and asks him to extract blood from a stone one last time. The Aussie seamers look shattered, understandably given their relentless yakka. Cummins has decided to bomb Leach, who gloves a horrible bouncer to safety on the off side. That could have gone anywhere.Leach takes a break to clean his glasses. Marais Erasmus has a word, so Leach politely points out that dealing with 90mph bouncers tends to steam up your lenses. The physio runs on, hoping to waste a bit of time with a concussion test. Leach tells him he just needed to clean his glasses, and then jumps under a follow-up bouncer.Cummins follows up with a few hard-faced words, his eyes full of malevolence. This is terrific stuff. Leach was hit very badly by Morne Morkel last year, which affected him enormously until he got that 92 against Ireland. He’s showing so much courage, not to mention clarity under such extreme pressure.Hazlewood replaces Starc. Leach turns him off the pads for three. Moves into double figures. Staccato sentences hereon in. 21 overs left. Huge applause. Help."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adb358aea9f8fd7481f5791aea77ad4a330a0c6b/0_132_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a6ffe59aaf6c22ad9096bdfc75331e0","title":"share cultural highlights of japan for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tell us about your best experiences, from visiting ancient temples to manga comic stores in Tokyo or Osaka … anywhere you’ve enjoyed Japanese culture old or newYou may have walked a pilgrimage trail, attended sumo wrestling or bathed in a hot spring.

Not a single candidate is formally running on the United Russia ticket as the party’s popularity has hit rock bottom.Alexei Navalny, the most prominent of Russia’s opposition leaders, was hoping to take advantage of the discontent by calling on supporters to back his “smart voting” strategy and cast ballots for the candidate with the best chance of defeating a pro-Kremlin candidate. “Today we are fighting to destroy United Russia’s monopoly,” Navalny told reporters after voting in the capital.Analysts say the vote is a test run ahead of parliamentary elections due in 2021 – both of the opposition’s ability to mobilise support and the authorities’ willingness to tolerate dissent.Outside a polling station in Moscow’s Gagarinsky district there were more police officers than voters on Sunday.“Russia is not developing, we are trapped under layers of corruption,” said Yulia, 32, who did not want to give her last name. “I have come here today to change that. I voted for the communist in order to split the vote for United Russia.”Vadim Turinov, 42, an IT consultant, was dismissive of the “smart-voting” plan. “Why vote at all? These local elections do not matter at all,” he said.Activists alleged multiple incidents of wrongdoing at polling stations across the country, including ballot stuffing. Vladimir Yegorov, a monitoring group coordinator, was arrested on Saturday night. In the city of Penza, several observers were detained ahead of the election and released without further explanation.Lyubov Sobol, 31, a lawyer for Navalny’s anti-corruption fund who was barred from running, said Sunday’s vote showed authorities had given up pretending that elections in Russia were democratic. “This is the funeral for even the semblance of democratic elections,” said the lawyer, who was a key protest leader.United Russia, formed in 2001 to support Putin, has seen its popularity collapse in recent years as incomes have fallen under western sanctions.Konstantin Gaaze from the Carnegie Moscow Center said the economy would ultimately decide Putin’s fate. “His approval rating declines when the economy does badly,” Gaaze said. “Putin’s biggest problem is that he has failed to fight poverty.”Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f6749ca01c02dc430d7bdcc8cc6c766df78437/255_72_1362_817/master/1362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=282f3251ee658ff7a2aabe30ba486783","title":"spanish theatre troupe la fura dels baus naumon","story":"La Fura dels Baus want to circumnavigate the globe on a refitted ice-breaker to draw attention to the climate emergencyFive hundred years after Ferdinand Magellan and his pan-European crew sailed, starved and mutinied their way around the world, a Spanish theatre company best known for its innovative and often provocative performances is paying homage to the long-dead explorers with a voyage of its own.The Barcelona-based collective La Fura dels Baus made headlines in 2003 when its honestly named XXX show opened in London after being cleared by the politan police’s vice squad. Their latest undertaking, however, is considerably more hardcore.In spring next year, the company’s trusty ship, the Naumon (Worldship), will begin a tour of Spanish ports to commemorate the first circumnavigation of the world and to warn of the need for action on the climate emergency.Aided by a rigid but foldable high-tech sail, it will then crisscross the world, spreading its message from sea to sea and port to port.Carlus Padrissa, one of the founders of La Fura dels Baus – “and also slightly the captain of this project” – sees the 1519-22 circumnavigation as one of the greatest achievements of European, and indeed human, history.“For me, it’s on a par with reaching the moon or going to Mars,” he says. “Of the 270 who set out, only 18 made it back. This was the time when man came out of the darkness of the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance.“This is when people all over the world began to interact. The idea is to put on a show to say to people: ‘Look, we’re all on the same planet – we’re all in the same boat – so why don’t we try rowing in the same direction?’”The Naumon, which has been bobbing on the freshwaters of the Rhine for the past decade, is being fixed up in a Santander shipyard.Once the eight metre by 20 metre sail, designed by  Bound4Blue , has been fitted, sea tests will begin and the team hopes the ship will make its first call in Seville early next year.Members of the theatre company will be joined by scientists from Spain’s National Research Council, who will monitor the sail’s performance and conduct experiments.“In September, we’ll head for Hamburg,” says Padrissa. “After that, we’ll go wherever they call us.”Padrissa points out that the Naumon, which was built in Norway in 1964, is one of countless polluting vessels in need of a cleaner means of propulsion.“We have to put a new sail on. The idea is to recycle and to show that our generation of baby boomers can be a bit of a problem for the planet.”He also notes that the Naumon was originally an ice-breaker: “So it’s a perfect concept for smashing cultural ice.”In each port, the company will stage Sfera Mundi, a big show that follows on from the spectacle La Fura dels Baus created for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Key themes will include poverty, illness and pollution.The Naumon itself will also play host to an immersive exhibition.“It will be about the possibility of a third world war and what will happen if the world falls apart because of climate change,” says Padrissa.“It’ll be a little apocalyptic, a little bit like Picasso’s Guernica. We want people to come out and say: ‘Shit! What do I have to do to stop things happening?’”With the Naumon undergoing its latest metamorphosis as the sail is attached and its hull painted in the colours of the UN sustainable development goals, Padrissa and other members of the collective find themselves suffering anxieties long shared by theatre companies and expedition planners.Fears of seasickness and scurvy, of mutiny or of being reduced to eating leather are overshadowed by thoughts of empty coffers.“We’re a bit worried about money – we don’t know exactly how much things will cost because we don’t really know where we’ll be going,” says Padrissa.“We’ve spent money bringing the Naumon back we’ve spent money fixing it up. We don’t have any more money. We’ve got some deals lined up but we’re worried about being able to pull it off properly. We don’t have the dosh to get all the way around the world.”But then again, he adds, the whole enterprise is a bit on the hoof, or keel. And that is rather the point.“There’s no plan,” says Padrissa. “It’s a bit like Magellan: they set off but they weren’t really sure where they were going or what they’d find. It’s all an adventure. Will we do it? Won’t we? Will we ruin ourselves? We don’t know. It’s about risk and adventure.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/496c41d2abf653b215dc779237fa9444a46a0255/1836_223_3627_2176/master/3627.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49ded4fe8a994c9083d86d0e6b204d6b","title":"viktor orban eu commissioner rough ride laszlo trocsanyi hungary","story":"As justice minister, László Trócsányi oversaw laws that put Hungary and EU in conflictViktor Orbán’s choice for Hungary’s EU commissioner faces “a very rough ride” in the European parliament, as MEPs warned that the Hungarian government’s record on the rule of law could not be ignored.The nominee, László Trócsányi, described as an executor of Orbán’s will, was Hungary’s justice minister from 2014 until elected to the European parliament in May.An architect of plans for Hungary’s new system of courts, widely criticised for limiting the powers of the judiciary, Trócsányi’s record in Hungary’s nationalist government looks set to complicate his path to the commission’s Berlaymont headquarters.As justice minister, Trócsányi introduced a series of laws that triggered legal conflicts with the European commission he now seeks to join. He oversaw laws criminalising NGOs for helping refugees and setting up Hungary’s container camps for asylum seekers, as well as measures that led to the Central European University being forced to quit Budapest.His nomination offers an early test for the incoming commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who is to unveil her team on Tuesday.The Dutch MEP Sophie in ’t Veld, who sits on the parliament’s civil liberties and home affairs committee, told the  the nomination was “intended as a provocation”.“Quite frankly, given the track record of this government and this minister, it seems purely hypothetical he will ever pass the basic test,” she said referring to the EU’s fundamental values on rule of law. “How can we put someone in charge who does not respect or recognise the treaties?“It is my expectation that he will get a very rough ride in parliament.”Every member state has nominated a commissioner, except the UK, which is due to leave the EU the day before the new commission takes office.EU commissioners are not meant to represent their governments, but often play an informal role, both as a back channel to the capital, and in promoting national approaches to economics and foreign policy in Brussels.Trócsányi, who said he had had “constructive” talks with Von der Leyen, was rumoured to be interested in taking charge of EU policy on enlargement or foreign policy towards neighbouring countries. But the latest speculation suggested he could be put in charge of the EU’s aid budget.“If that is true, it would be a surprising, indeed highly alarming choice by Mrs von der Leyen,” In ‘t Veld said. “The portfolio of humanitarian aid includes issues like sexual and reproductive health, including abortion. An arch-conservative commissioner at the helm will have devastating consequences for the lives of countless women and girls.”The German Social Democrat Birgit Sippel said she was “not happy” with the Hungarian’s nomination, adding that a foreign policy portfolio would be a problem. “It wouldn’t be a good idea to give him a profile on migration, on home affairs, on justice, so that is something we have to focus on.”The parliament’s political groups will start discussing the nominees this week, but have yet to reach collective views.The Von der Leyen commission can only take office if all commissioners win MEPs’ approval in a vote, following inidual hearings. Usually one or two commissioners are rejected by the parliament, as MEPs seek to exert their power.The confrontation between MEPs and Trócsányi looks set to unfold as EU ministers open discussions later this month on whether Orbán’s government is in breach of the rule of law – following the unprecedented decision by the parliament to trigger the EU’s most serious disciplinary procedure.The rumbling discontent echoes a similar row over Orbán’s last European commissioner nominee, Tibor Navracsics, also a former Hungarian justice minister.Born in 1963 in Székesfehérvár in central Hungary, Viktor Orbán has been leader of the Fidesz national conservative party in two long stints since 1993. He has been Hungary’s prime minister between 1998 and 2002, and again since 2010. After two years of military service he studied law in Budapest, and then political science at Pembroke College, Oxford.For nationalists across Europe, Orbán has become a hero, the embodiment of a nativist leader willing to eschew liberal political correctness and speak aggressively about the need to defend so-called Christian Europe. Steve Bannon has called him Trump before Trump, and Nigel Farage and Italy’s Matteo Salvini are admirers.For many liberals, and increasingly for some of his supposed allies in the EPP, he signifies all that is rotten, corrupt and downright scary in contemporary politics on the continent.“The age of liberal democracy is at an end,” Orbán told the Hungarian parliament shortly after Fidesz won a third successive electoral victory in 2018. “It is no longer able to protect people’s dignity, provide freedom, guarantee physical security or maintain Christian culture.”His messaging, repeated in speeches and interviews ad nauseam, is that he is on a mission to protect Hungary and the rest of Europe from the evils of migration from the Middle East and Africa. He has frequently accused the Hungarian-born financier George Soros of a conspiracy to overrun Europe with Muslim migrants.Orbán’s Fidesz party has a two-thirds majority in the Hungarian parliament, which gives him leeway to make sweeping constitutional changes, and he has spoken of a plan to reshape the country over the next decade. He has installed loyalists in previously independent institutions, put a vast media network under the control of cronies and brushed off protests from the disgruntled urban elites.One thing Orbán’s admirers and detractors agree on is that he has become symbolic of something bigger than the fate of a smallish central European state with a population of fewer than 10 million. The man himself clearly relishes his increasingly large role in European political discourse.Frustrated with Brussels and other European critics, Orbán has built alliances with neighbouring countries, notably throughout the V4, which comprises Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, all of whose leaders have at times expressed varying degrees of unhappiness with the EU, and whose unity in messaging is growing.For Orbán, the idea that he is up against an exhausted, decaying vision of Europe is one that he has returned to again and again in his speeches. In October 2018, he implicitly compared today’s EU to the Nazis, Soviets and other imperial powers.Awarded the low-profile portfolio of education, culture, youth and sport, Navracsics had to walk a tightrope between Brussels and Budapest.“It’s very difficult to operate in a situation where everyone in Brussels and everyone in Budapest is waiting for the slightest sign where they can say you have betrayed them,” said one diplomatic source. “A lot of people in Budapest were saying he had become a brainwashed liberal, whereas right from the beginning he faced a hostile environment in the commission.”As his possible successor, Trócsányi will face the same scepticism from both sides. The former diplomat is not seen as a close ally of Orbán: “He is an extremely talented expert, a professional executor and legal framer of Orbán’s will,” the source said. “And I think that is how Orbán looks at him, as a legal tool.”Trócsányi said he was “delighted that president-elect Ursula von der Leyen considers me in her future team. It is a great honour.” He declined to comment on the criticism from the MEPs, or his portfolio."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4006631.1567525864!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a potted history of plants at dublin s national botanic gardens","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCharlotte Salter-Townshend,  who devised the new walks,  will focus on the geographical origins of plants and the role some played in the development of slavery and international trading routesPlants and Power: Botanical Imperialism is the intriguing theme of a new series of guided walks in the National Botanic Gardens on Saturdays in September.Devised by guide Charlotte Salter-Townshend, the walks will explore the geographical origins of plants and the role certain plants played in empire building, the development of slavery and international trading routes.“I’ll be retelling certain parts of history through plants and look at how the world was shaped through the trading of tea, coffee, sugar, cotton and other plants,” explains Salter-Townshend, who has a master’s degree in public history and cultural heritage from Trinity College Dublin.Admitting to having scant knowledge of how to grow plants, this enthusiastic guide at the botanic gardens has, instead, a fascination for the history of botanical gardens, 19th-century plant hunters and the often ruthless trading of newly discovered plants from Asia and South America.For example, Salter-Townshead has tracked how rubber, which originated in Brazil, was brought through England to southeast Asia, where rubber production was then developed. And, did you know that the Dutch traded New York (formerly called New Amsterdam) with the British for control of the sugar plantations in Surinam in South America?Trade wars“We rely on plants for our survival, but there is a dark side to the story of plants and how people were exploited through slavery, smuggling and trade wars. Even today, in parts of the world, drug gangs are gaining control of avocado plantations,” she says.On her tours, Salter-Townshead will take visitors on a potted history of plants whose trade played a role in the rise and fall of empires. Take tea, for example, which became a fashionable drink in England when Charles II married a Portuguese princess where tea drinking had already become popular.“The British had been buying tea from the Chinese since the 17th century. This was costing them a lot of money so they began exporting opium to China in the 19th century, which led to huge social and economic problems in China and the so-called Opium Wars.“The Scottish plant hunter Robert Fortune smuggled thousands of tea plants on ships from China to India so the English could grow tea in India instead, which led to the establishment of the British East India Company,” explains Salter-Townshend.Developed in 1795The National Botanical Gardens in Dublin was first developed in 1795 at the gardens of the Dublin Society and then the Royal Dublin Society. “Its original function was to support industry and agriculture with practical education for landowners and farm labourers. There was a hay garden and a cattle garden as well as a vegetable garden,” explains Salter-Townshead.It wasn’t until the 1830s, as the British empire expanded, that the more exotic plants start to arrive. “Plant hunters in Asia, Africa and South America sent back seed and living plants to Kew Gardens and to the gardens here, as Dublin was the second city of the British empire.”On her tours, she shows visitors many of these exotic plants held in the magnificent curvilinear glasshouses at the botanic gardens.The gardens also has a collection of plants that Roger Casement brought back to Dublin from the Congo while on a mission there to report to the British government on the Belgian colonial regime.“We have the original coffee, cocoa and baobab plants in our herbarium that Roger Casement brought from the Congo in the early 1900s,” says Salter-Townshead.Wild Ireland sectionShe will also take visitors through the wild Ireland section of the gardens to explore how potatoes, which were originally brought from South America to Europe by the Spanish conquistadors, became so popular in Ireland. “Potatoes, which belong to the nightshade flowering plants, were originally viewed with suspicion, deemed to be poisonous and associated with witchcraft. Yet when they were brought to Europe, they produced a high yield in a small patch, were nutritious and didn’t require harvesting equipment, so they became a staple crop, which led to population boom,” she says.Interestingly, it was David Moore, the curator of the gardens in the 1840s, who first noted potato blight at Glasnevin on August 20th, 1845, and predicted that the impact on the potato crop would lead to famine in Ireland. He later correctly identified the fungal cause of the blight but narrowly missed finding a remedy.The big focus at the gardens at that time was the building of the Richard Turner curvilinear glasshouses and the propagation of orchids. “This in itself shows the power of the Dublin Society and the prestige of the gardens at the time,” says Salter-Townshend.While guided tours focused on such a vast historical theme can only whet visitors’ appetites, she is keen to bring a contemporary angle to her story of plants and power.Bioersity“The focus of botanic gardens has changed from being a place where plants are used for profit and power to one of protecting bioersity. So, for example, we grow heritage apple trees here and we save seeds of tomatoes for future food security,” she says.National Botanic Gardens conservation botanist Dr Noeleen Smyth is the Irish representative for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. “The trade of wildlife is the fourth-largest illegal trade after drugs, human trafficking and arms trafficking,” says Salter-Townshend.Plants and power: Botanical Imperialism, a themed guided tour of the National Botanical Gardens, run on Saturday, September 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th, starting at the Education and Visitor Centre at 2.30pm.

The field has been largely neglected since Harvard psychologist Timothy Leary began to investigate how cognitive processes and emotions are affected by mind-altering substances in the 1960s.Psilocybin is the key psychedelic compound found in magic mushroomsLSD and other psychedelics have been illegal in the US for several decades but studies suggesting they may be effective in medical treatments has contributed to a growing cultural shift in how psychedelic substances are perceived. Earlier this year Denver became the first US city to decriminalise magic mushrooms, in the wake of research which suggests some of its compounds can be beneficial for treating depression and anxiety among cancer patients.Psilocybin is currently listed as a Tier 1 illegal drug in the US, the equivalent classification to a Class A substance in the UK, and has not yet been approved as a medical treatment. However researchers hope that the new centre may contribute to a sea change in medical approaches.The new funding is the largest ever single-donation to the field and will fund a five-year research programme to examine whether psilocybin, the psychedelic compound found in magic mushrooms, can treat alcoholism, post traumatic stress disorder and several other complex conditions.Host Tim Ferriss speaks onstage at \u0026#39The Tim Ferriss Show LIVE during a SXSW Conference Many of the tests being conducted by the centre are the first of their kind and will involve between 200 and 250 volunteers over the course of a number of trials. In most cases patients will be given one or two doses of the drug while under constant observation by a therapist.Dr Frederick Barrett, assistant professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins, said psilocybin offers a “radically different model” of treatment because psychedelic drugs  “don\u0027t follow the cycle of abuse”.“People don\u0027t typically experience craving or withdrawal after the use of psychedelic drugs,” he told The Sunday .Dr Barrett said researchers are still unsure why psychedelic drugs can offer effective treatment but some theories suggest that the drugs work on the brain by “increasing cognitive flexibility” or altering the brain\u0027s “balance of positive and negative emotional information”.However Dr Barrett cautioned against the decriminalisation debate being waged in several US cities, saying: “I don\u0027t think anybody right now, at least in the research world, is thinking that it\u0027s a good idea to decriminalise psychedelic drugs or to make them available widely for such use. These are nothing if not very powerful drugs, which is one of the reasons they may hold so much promise for therapeutic use”.One of the donors to the new centre is Tim Ferriss, an American entrepreneur and podcast host, who has previously funded a similar center at Imperial College London. Mr Ferriss said he had deeply personal motivations for getting involved in the new centre - including a history of Alzheimer\u0027s on both sides of his family and seeing his best friend growing up on Long Island die from a fentanyl overdose.But he added: “On the macro level, I really look at it the same way that would I look at investing in start-ups or businesses and I stopped doing in 2015 and pushed all my chips into this. This entire field has been largely neglected in the sense that there has been a near complete lack of federal funding so that\u0027s exciting to me in that you can have a large impact with a relatively small amount of capital”.The other private donors to the centre are the Steven \u0026amp Alexandra Cohen Foundation, which provided the bulk of the centre\u0027s funding, as well as Matt Mullenweg, the co-founder of WordPress, TOMS shoe brand founder Blake Mycoskie and investor Craig Nerenberg.British Airways tells passengers not turn up at airports, as airline\u0026#39s biggest ever strike begins Comment: Even for a hardened Marxist, antagonising the neighbours is a bold moveInterior designer sued by US client over claims she neglected project to work on Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s Frogmore renovationFormer mayor calls for Welsh town to be \u0026#39flattened\u0026#39 by a bomb because it is turning into a \u0026#39ghetto\u0026#39Police helicopters scrambled to reports of plane crash - only to discover it was probably a meteor breaking up Caledonian Sleeper passengers left without water in the bathrooms after cleaners used the wrong kind of bleachHong Kong protesters call for help from Donald TrumpNeighbours of flying Frenchman Franky Zapata complain over noise and fumes from hoverboardHurricane Dorian: more than 23 members of Sidney Poitier\u0026#39s family missingMatteo Salvini to join protest against Italy\u0026#39s new government as it moves to undo hardline policiesPrince Andrew in heated \u0026#39disagreement\u0026#39 with royal aideDominic Raab hits back over Amber Rudd\u0026#39s resignation, insisting ministers knew what they were signing up forStudent with stoma accused of taking drugs in disabled toilet by Wetherspoons staffWho will replace Jamie Laing on Strictly Come Dancing 2019?Who will win Strictly Come Dancing 2019?

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe cryptocurrency hit a record high\u0026nbspof $20,000 in 2017, coinciding with record-high search levels on Google.Since the recent online search surge, the price of bitcoin has risen steadily, but is nowhere near the levels it reached two years ago.\u0026nbspThe cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $10,800, having been trading below $9,400 before 29 August.The rising price over the last week\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspbeen attributed to escalating economic and geopolitical uncertainty around the globe.Market analysts told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspearlier this week that turmoil surrounding Brexit, along with the trade war between the US and China, had caused investors to turn to bitcoin as a relatively safe haven asset.However, this analysis came before this search trend was spotted and some now believe that it may be having a significant impact on the price. It\u0026nbspremains unclear is who is behind it and how they are doing it.It is reasonable to assume that someone is behind these radical changes, wrote cryptocurrency analyst Bendik Norheim Schei.\u0026nbspThat the same pattern can be seen all over the world may indicate that VPN services have been used to distribute the search across the world, thus achieving a global trend.The price of bitcoin is notoriously volatile and is often difficult to both predict and explain.The correlation between online search interest and bitcoin\u0027s price has until now been a rare constant.\u0026nbspA study in 2017 found that high search volumes for bitcoin-related terms like \u0027btc usd\u0027 often preceded price bubbles, while low engagement usually signalled a good time to buy.Data gathered by digital marketing firm SemRush noted an 80 per cent correlation between search volume and bitcoin\u0027s price, though no conclusions were drawn as to which was the determining factor.Cryptocurrency analyst Anton Lucian described\u0026nbspthe latest increase in bitcoin search levels as just plain strange and pointed to manipulation as the likely culprit.Bitcoin investor and author Glen Goodman explained how such manipulation might be used to augment the price of the cryptocurrency.There are algorithms programmed to look at Google Trends data and try to find correlations between numbers of searches for the word \u0027btc\u0027 and the movements in the bitcoin price, he said.If they detect patterns, it may be profitable to trade off that data. This hacker may be buying some bitcoin, then sending a ton of \u0027btc\u0027 search queries to Google.\u0026nbspThe algoirthms see search numbers have risen and are triggered to buy a lot of bitcoin, which pushes the price up, and the hacker then sells their bitcoin at a profit. Easy money.Google has measures to prevent people manipulating searches, though practices like Google Bombing have proved in the past that it is possible to game the system.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsphas reached out to Google for comment.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A\u0026nbsp(non-fashionable) fashion retailer with food, or\u0026nbspa non-essential food seller with fashion?Click to followThe IndependentNothing lasts forever. Of course, I know that. But for someone who grew up in a family that, like many, worshipped at the altar of St Michael, the fall of Marks and Spencer and its brand still comes as a shock.Our clothes were M\u0026ampS, our food was M\u0026ampS, my father even bought my mother shares in the chain – so much did we pour into its tills. For many years, until the arrival of an Asda, it was the only shop of any serious presence in the town. There was a Boots and a Tesco, but they were nothing compared to the Marks, sitting as it did in the plum position in the main shopping street. Now that branch has just closed, and coincidentally or not, M\u0026ampS has dropped out of the FTSE100.There’s a huge Tesco, an Aldi, a Lidl, a Morrisons, and still, the Asda. But the once grand M\u0026ampS lies empty. Meanwhile, the company that was the first retailer to break through the £1bn profits barrier, no longer ranks among the country’s biggest 100 stock market-listed concerns. It’s a sad, sorry state of affairs. And once unthinkable.There were early clues as to what was coming. The M\u0026ampS was on two floors but even I, as a schoolboy, noticed that hardly anyone went upstairs. They just didn’t. Every so often the manager would try selling something different up there\u0026nbspand it didn’t matter. The escalator would continue to whirr upwards, devoid of passengers.M\u0026ampS would have one colour of sock in all sizes but not the hue you wanted. Likewise, with shirts, plenty of a certain variety, but lacking in others. Clearly, the group had an issue with its supply lines.Marks and Spencer to be relegated from FTSE 100As Tesco moved to the other side of town, to giant premises with lots of free parking, the contrast between the venerable M\u0026ampS, stuck in the town centre amid tight streets with double yellow lines, and the once budget purveyor now transformed, thanks to a dynamic management superbly led, first by Ian MacLaurin then by Terry Leahy, could not be more marked. Tesco always had what you were looking for, its lorries were forever unloading their wares, the firm’s skill was in perfecting just-in-time delivery. M\u0026ampS started to appear outdated, and where fashion was concerned, outmoded.Along came Next, offering much as an alternative shopping experience, then a lot more with the launch of its mail order catalogue. This giant book soon became a staple in middle-class homes. We didn’t know so at the time but it allowed Next to perfect warehousing and logistical systems and was a precursor to the onset of online.M\u0026ampS was snooty about Next, as it was about any aspect involving so-called competitors. They could dream up as many gimmicks as they wished, but it, M\u0026ampS, was the bellwether of the high street, the prime tenant in any decent new development, the great name that all others aspired to. It would not be side-tracked by the rest.That feeling of detachment was confirmed by a visit to the old M\u0026ampS headquarters in London’s Baker Street. Going there was like entering a section of the civil service, with long corridors, and closed doors with numbers on them. There was a sense of anonymity, of people doing their jobs, but minus any passion and creativity. There was no collective buzz, no evidence of urgent energy.Its staff were famously treated better than anyone else’s, enjoying all manner of benefits and perks. But instead of encouraging them to be daring and think the impossible, it merely fuelled a corporate smugness.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But while M\u0026ampS was bedding down, other retailers were motoring – creating new ranges, finessing their internet services.In clothing,\u0026nbspH\u0026ampM and Zara were producing brighter, modern items, (along with Topshop they were known for fast\u0026nbspfashion, a phrase that was never applied to M\u0026ampS) while Primark was undercutting on price. Even Asda chipped away with its George range, providing essentials for less.In food, Waitrose and Tesco Premium matched M\u0026ampS at the top end, with Aldi and Lidl showing what could be bought for a fraction, without a significant drop in quality, at the other.M\u0026ampS dallied with homeware, but against John Lewis, which long ago stole its hegemony as the company-to-look-towards for indications of economic buoyancy. While John Lewis\u0026nbspbecame the anchor that shopping centre managers and online specialist suppliers craved,\u0026nbspM\u0026ampS failed to excite.Successive managements tried to steer the ship. None succeeded in arresting the drift. Increasingly, M\u0026ampS seemed not to know what it was: a (non-fashionable) fashion retailer with food a non-essential food seller with fashion.In its latest incarnation, the leadership team of chairman Archie Norman and chief executive Steve Rowe is probably the best M\u0026ampS has had for a while. They know their stuff.But Norman and Rowe have inherited a bloated vessel, one with too many stores in the wrong places, and not enough high-tech knowhow and resource to pack a punch on the internet. They should be striking out with newness and innovation\u0026nbspbut instead they’re forced to devote too much time and energy to cutting and fighting fires.Ejection from the FTSE100 is further evidence of that contracting business. M\u0026ampS’s downward spiral continues.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

John Hibbard, then in his late twenties, had sailed out to Rottnest Island, off Perth, Western Australia, and was windsurfing the best waves of his life in Stark Bay. The sun smiled down on him out of a clear blue sky and a 20-knot wind and 10ft swell propelled him across wave after immaculate wave. Finally satisfied and exhausted, knocking back an ice-cold Corona, he realised it could never get better than this. But the thought occurred to him: what am I going to do with the rest of my life? The answer to that question was\u0026nbspRed Paddle Co, of which he is co-founder and CEO.We had a plan, John Hibbard and I, to take out a couple of his stand-up paddleboards (or SUPs) and ride them along the River Dart in Devon, stop somewhere for lunch and paddle back. It would have been idyllic. The only problem was that it was pelting with rain all day, which put a bit of a dampener on the idea. But at least he had more time to show me around his dedicated new headquarters near Totnes on the south coast with a view out over Dartmoor.Hibbard was British windsurfing champion in 2008. He was born in Basingstoke but brought up in Devon. He windsurfed around the world, from Maui to Tahiti, from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, sponsored by Nissan and Fat Face, and getting photographed while doing it. He loved the technical challenge, mastering the equipment, no matter how gnarly the conditions. It sounds like the dream life. And it was, but there were a couple of downsides. One was that it was lonely: his only friends were also his rivals so he couldn’t hang out with them. The other was the sheer amount of kit. Hibbard recalls once checking in 50 bags at an airport (admittedly he was carrying stuff for a friend too).After becoming British champion, and sustaining various injuries along the way, he was looking for something new. “I thought there must be more to life on the beach.” Then one day he was doing a photoshoot in Harlyn Bay and there was no wind and he said:\u0026nbsp“I’ve got this paddleboard thing in the back of the car.” A friend had told him about it but he’d never tried it before. He paddled out and caught a wave and rode it all the way to the beach. The shot made a double-page spread in the magazines. He had found the solution, not just for the lack of wind, but of what to do with his life.He took the board out on a river and he realised two things: one, that it was easy for someone who had never been on a board before to pick it up – it didn’t need the kind of dedication required by surfing or windsurfing. And secondly that it opened up a totally different perspective on the world.“I’d lived around that river for years, but I’d never been up it before,” he says.\u0026nbsp“I was seeing things I’d never seen before. So many trees, a kiln, an old pub. And standing up you have a better view than from a kayak.” He had been all around the world but all he ever saw was beaches and airports. With the paddleboard you didn’t need wind and you didn’t need waves. This was “the bicycle of the water” – the ideal leisure craft of the future. And it was sociable: you could go out with friends, you weren’t competing for wave of the day. It wasn’t extreme, but it was an experience.Stand-up paddleboard originated in Hawaii. For hundred of years people had been standing on boards and using paddle power to punt them from island to island. Then Laird Hamilton, big-wave surfer extraordinaire, based in Maui, adopted and glamorised them in the early Noughties. Hollywood stars could be seen riding them on the west coast. But the reality is that they were huge, unwieldy, and vulnerable to dings.\u0026nbspHibbard, fired up with enthusiasm, first of all tried his hand at selling them around the country. But it was, as he says wryly, “a slow burn”. Windsurfing shops had shrunk in size along with windsurfing boards and sails and they didn’t have the space for these bigger ones. By chance, Hibbard came across an inflatable board, made in South Korea for an American company, and he realised that this was the future.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Red Paddle Co Paddleboard: The bicycle of the water Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.But the future didn’t happen overnight. The Korean manufacturer made him a board but it wasn’t great. For one thing Hibbard was too out of breath after pumping it up to come out with a decent sales spiel. And for another the board itself was too spongy, more like an airbed or a lilo than a proper board. “It was a great idea but badly executed,” he says. Which is what inspired him to come up with his new mission statement: it has to be authentic. Without compromise. The board has to be a real board.Hibbard asked an old friend of his, a surfer and animator, to design him a logo. His designer friend told him that he needed a name before he could have a logo. He realised that he’d done everything but he still didn’t have a name for the company. They were sitting on the beach in Woolacombe watching the sun go down and Hibbard looked into the sunset and said, “There it is: red – red sky at night.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Everything collapses down so that it’s portable and it all goes in a custom-designed bag (wheels or backpack). The pump is now double-barrelled and takes half the time with half the effort. And when the board is inflated there’s a patented stiffening system to make it as rigid as the old foam and fibre glass but even more robust with a double skin and dimpled surface. I inspected their boards and I can confirm – having paddleboarded in Hawaii – they look and feel like real boards. They don’t bend. (Check out YouTube, where they have a 22-ton JCB grinding over one with no ill effects.) Everything is designed and engineered by Red and produced in house, using a 3D\u0026nbspprinter for the smallest parts.\u0026nbspNow they’re exporting thousands of boards to 60 countries around the world – selling them even in Hawaii, which feels like carrying coals to Newcastle. “Customers do the selling for us,” says Hibbard. And there is a blind paddleboarder called Dean Dunbar in Scotland riding a Red paddleboard. Mission accomplished.John Hibbard had one stroke of genius. When he took people out on an SUP for the first time they fell in love with it but then they would say, pointing at the nose, “What’s that?” And he would say, “That’s the valve.” And they would go (with an air of deflation), “Oh, really?” So he simply moved the valve from the front of the board to the back. Now nobody even notices it’s inflatable. Until he shows them. And they go, “Wow, I don’t believe it!Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The same is true of construction, 45 down from 45.3, and manufacturing, 47.4 down from 48. The difference is the latter two sectors are now shrinking, as is business activity overall.

This was because he had renounced his citizenship in 2005 – a decision he says he took on the advice of both his solicitors and the Malaysian High Commission, and now regretted.Within hours, Kee\u0026nbspwas flown back to the UK, which he describes as a “total waste of money”.UN hopes to end ‘scourge of statelessness’ within 10 yearsImmigration rules leave stateless Malaysians in limboRemembering what happened, he says: “I was shocked and confused as they just said they going to deport me when\u0026nbspI went to the\u0026nbspHome Office for normal reporting schedule.“They transferred me from the police station to several detention centres within a week\u0026nbspbefore two long journey flights to Malaysia and back without rest,\u0026nbspwhere three escorts were flying with me.\u0026nbsp“I felt like I was being treated like a very bad criminal or maybe not even a human. I was so exhausted after the week of this unforgettably\u0026nbsptragic journey.”Kee is one of hundreds of former Malaysian citizens who were rendered stateless more than a decade ago when they were led to believe a BOC\u0026nbsppassport – a relic from the UK’s colonial past – would make them UK citizens.Home Office staff have acknowledged that these iniduals are “trapped” as Malaysia refuses to allow\u0026nbspthem back into the country but the UK government also refuses to grant them any form of status, leaving them unable to work and driving some into exploitation as a means of survival.\u0026nbspOthers have been detained in immigration centres and later released because there was no prospect of removing them, while two people – one being Kee\u0026nbsp– are known to have been deported and then immediately “bounced back” from Malaysia.Since he was released from detention, Kee\u0026nbsphas been doing poorly paid, cash-in-hand\u0026nbspinformal delivery work\u0026nbspand is relying on friends to house\u0026nbsphim.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDescribing his plight, Kee\u0026nbspsays: “It’s sad and\u0026nbsptiring. You have to work informally and you have to survive by yourself, and when the Home Office asks you have to say you aren’t working. How do they expect us to survive?”“I want to go back to Malaysia but I can’t. I’m stuck, I\u0026nbspcan’t go anywhere. I’m just waiting here, wasting my life away.”Another person affected is Yan Kit, 42, who arrived to the UK in 2001 to study mechanical engineering. His problems began in 2005 when he, like Kee, was advised that he could obtain British nationality if he renounced him Malaysian citizenship.He says he wishes to go back to Malaysia, where his wife lives, but he says the Malaysian authorities have told him directly that there is no route for him to be granted residency.The 42-year-old, who lives with his uncle as he is unable to find a landlord who will rent to him without UK status, was arrested in 2015 by immigration officers during a raid on the garage where he was working.“They tried to contact the Malaysian government to deport me, but they said they couldn’t deport me because I wasn’t a Malaysian citizen anymore. So in the end the Home Office let me out again. They did nothing to help me resolve the situation,” he says.“I haven’t been able to work since then. Now I just sit at home. The worst thing is every month I have to go and report with the UK border agency, but it means nothing. They just write another date on the letter and let you go. If I ask questions, they can’t tell me what’s happening. They just give me the date for my next report time.”Kit says that while he is able to visit his wife in Malaysia on visit visas, these only last up to one month, and the travel is expensive. He adds: “If I could get back my Malaysian citizenship, I would go back.”Liew Teh, another person affected by the issue, says he was shocked when, in 2009, he was told by a job agency that he could\u0026nbspnot be employed anywhere due to his immigration status.Liew Teh)The Telford resident, 38, who completed his engineering master’s degree in the UK in 2005,\u0026nbsphad applied for British citizenship after renouncing his Malaysian passport on the advice of his solicitor.“I was studying for my degree, and my life just stopped there, not moving forward. I haven’t been able to use my skills. I wanted to pursue my dream, my career, but everything turned into a mess,” he says.“I’ve been very depressed. I can’t go back to see my parents, because I fear I won’t be able to come back. I can’t get into a relationship or anything, because everything is stuck.”Teh says\u0026nbspthat, no longer able to afford a solicitor, he has\u0026nbspbeen fighting\u0026nbspto resolve the issue on his own, and that speaking out to the press was his last resort.He adds: “Thankfully I have some friends supporting me, but I can’t rely on them forever. Something needs to be done so I can live my life.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Home Office will work with Malaysian British Overseas Citizens who have concerns over their immigration status.”Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

DSEI is a moral disgrace and should be firmly opposed, whether it is taking place in London or anywhere else.\u0026nbsp“It will bring a roll call of the world’s most repressive regimes together with all of the biggest arms companies. They will be there for one reason: to sell as many weapons as possible, regardless of the consequences.”A day inside the world’s largest arms fairThe event is supported by the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Trade, which has a wing dedicated to arms exports.British defence giant BAE Systems is listed as a “platinum partner” alongside American firm General Dynamics, while the United Arab Emirates will have its own pavilion.The country is part of a Saudi-led coalition bombing Yemen in a campaign that has killed an estimated 8,000 civilians\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspdriven\u0026nbspa deadly cholera outbreak and famine.Government figures show that export licences worth £6.2bn have been granted to members of the Saudi-led alliance in the four years since the conflict began in March 2015.In a letter to the Royal Docks Management Authority, which runs the ExCeL, Mr Khan said he was “opposed to London being used as a marketplace for the trade of weapons”.The local authority, Newham Council, also opposes DSEI being held at the conference centre and is holding an “alternative peace exhibition” hosting campaigners and politicians on Tuesday.Rokhsana Fiaz, the mayor of Newham, called the arms fair “abhorrent” after the council passed a motion “rejecting the economic arguments cynically deployed in defence of this trade”.DSEI arms fair in London, 2017 (Lizzie Dearden)“Newham is a very erse borough and many of our communities have links across the globe to those areas that have been affected by conflict, displacement and the horror of war,” she said.“This council is doing everything we can to prevent the DSEI coming to Newham ever again.” \u0026nbspIn a response to Mr Khan’s letter, DSEI event director Grant Burgham said it “plays an important role in supporting the Ministry of Defence’s procurement needs, helping deliver British jobs and economic growth, and deepening the UK’s partnerships on a global stage”.\u0026nbsp“The event serves only the interests of the legitimate defence and security industry, which is the most highly and tightly regulated in the world,” he added.“Government agencies responsible for enforcing the law at DSEI are on site during setup and throughout the exhibition.”Mr Burgham said all security costs incurred as a direct result of the event would be met\u0026nbspby DSEI, and that organisers “fully respect the right to lawful protest”.The government is fighting a Court of Appeal ruling that found its continued licensing of weapons to\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia “irrational and therefore unlawful” in June.“The UK operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world,” a spokesperson said. “The government undertakes a stringent process of scrutiny and approval before issuing any formal invitations to foreign governments to attend a major UK defence exhibition like DSEI.”\u0026nbspCampaign Against the Arms Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

It is a pathetic showing for a main opposition party at a time when it should be sailing ahead.Corbyn — branded a chicken by Boris Johnson for blocking a snap election — is doing so much worse than he did in his unexpectedly strong  ­election campaign.That’s because voters have seen so much more of this unreconstructed Marxist than they had then. And the more they see, the less they like it.Gradually it is dawning on the country that the economic policies advanced by Corbyn and his even more left-wing shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, would not so much redistribute national wealth as obliterate it.Earlier this week McDonnell came up with his latest wheeze for robbing the rich and — as he sees it — giving to the poor.He promised to give private tenants a “right to buy” their homes at a discount. I can see why this policy might initially seem attractive to young people who have been priced out of the housing market — a group with whom I have a lot of sympathy.Notionally, the policy may seem little dferent from Mrs Thatcher’s right to buy which enabled a generation of council house tenants to become homeowners for the first time.But there is every dference. If private investors were forced to sell their properties at a discount it would crash the housing market. Who would want to buy a property, knowing that the Government could come along at any moment and confiscate it If you crash the housing market, you crash the ­mortgage market, too. Private tenants might in theory gain the right to buy their homes, but that will not be much usebanks refuse to lend them any money.Confiscation is a thread which runs through so much of Labour’s programme.McDonnell has already announced a plan to snatch ten per cent of the shares of all private companies with more than  employees.He wants to put these shares into what he calls an inclusive ownership fund, invested on behalf of the workers.The workers shouldn’t get too excited, though. They would be allowed a maximum of £ a year in idends — and that onlytheir ­company was able to pay a idend.Meanwhile, the value of ordinary people’s pensions would plummet by far more than £. According to an analysis by law firm Clford Chance, workers would gain £billion — but overall, investors would lose £billion as share values crashed.Labour’s plan would dilute a company’s shares, effectively confiscating wealth from existing shareholders.Corbyn and McDonnell ­promote a fantasy that shareholders are a bunch of capitalist fatcats.Yet the reality is that almost everyone who works in the private sector is indirectly a shareholder. Share investments form the bedrock of the pension funds on which we will rely in old age.EvenMcDonnell was only helping himself to ten per cent of company shares initially, he could be sure to come back for more when his tax revenues failed to match his vast spending plans.These include spending £billion nationalising utility companies — that is £billion for gas and electricity firms, £billion for water firms, £billion to buy out Private Finance Initiativecontracts for schools and hospitals and £.billion for the Royal Mail.Labour claims this will save householders an average of £ a year on the basis that these firms will no longer have to pay shareholders.But he overlooks the poor record of nationalised industry. Lower efficiency could well lead to higher prices.How is McDonnell going to bring in the revenue for his massive spending plans He seems to live under the delusion thatyou raise taxes by x per cent, revenue, too, will rise by x per cent.Thus he claimed, in Labour’s  manesto, that reversing corporation tax cuts would raise £billion. But tax doesn’t work like that. In fact, cuts to corporation tax made by George Osborne increased revenue as multinationals erted profits to, rather than away from, Britain.So it is perverse for Labour to claim jacking up rates again will raise extra money. On the contrary, McDonnell would likely end up with LESS revenue.As for iniduals, McDonnell has promised to increase income tax for the top ten per cent of earners, which means anyone on more than £, a year. The top rate of income tax would go up to  per cent.But the real damage could come from a wealth tax — an annual levy on the value of homes, shares, bonds and all other assets.Although not yet Labour party policy, McDonnell has previously expressed approval for a whopping  per cent levy on the wealthiest ten per cent of the population.It wouldn’t be the super-wealthy who paid — they would quickly be off.In the s, a high-tax Labour ­government caused a brain drain which led to net outwards migration of , people over a few years.It would be worse now, as wealthy iniduals and businesses are much more mobile compared with the s.The real victims of a wealth tax would be ordinary people who have spent years saving to buy a home and build themselves a half-decent pension. To qualy for McDonnell’s wealth tax you would only need to own a home, and to have a pension with a combined value of £,.With Labour on just  per cent in the polls, of course, the nightmare of a Corbyn government — or at least a Corbyn majority government — is at the moment unlikely.But no one should be ­complacent.We could all too easily end up with a Labour-SNP coalition with the ­Scottish Nationalists happy to inflict pain on English, Welsh and Northern Irish voters infor the promise of a second independence referendum.Over the past couple of years we have had endless attempts to blame Brexit for every economic woe. Actually, over that period, employment has risen to an all-time high and the economy, except for the last quarter, has grown.But international investors, have been shy of Britain.The uncertainty over Brexit doesn’t help but talk to wealth managers and they tell you a very dferent story.What really strikes terror into investors is the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn arriving at the door to No.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They cannot believe what they’re witnessing.It was bad enough that millions were systematically lied to by Remainer MPs promising to respect the Brexit verdict, then refusing to fulfil on it.Now, outside of Boris Johnson’s Tory ranks, almost every politician seems bent on cancelling .million votes they disagree with, apparently oblivious to the potentially terrible consequences.They have crippled our pro-Brexit Prime Minister but refuse to replace him. They will make him beg Brussels for yet another humiliating delay. And, since this PM refuses, every witless Tom, Dick and Harriet in Parliament is branding him a liar, dictator and worse.Each melodramatic, hate-filled ­Commons speech is a Bafta-worthy performance designed for their social media feeds. It is pathetic and juvenile.But look at the polls.

No Deal, voters say, pales into insignicance after that. Overall the Tories also have a big lead. The hate campaign against Boris is, so far, a dud.All the ision, anger and political carnage of these last three years boil down to this: Too many Remainers — including a few Tory MPs, most of ­Labour’s and all the Lib Dems’ — don’t respect our democracy unless it delivers what they want. No wonder they care so little about destroying public trust in it.A new election, to choose better and more honest MPs and a majority ­Government to finally deliver Brexit on October , must happen.Corbyn, the most hated leader in our modern history, is too cowardly to agree.WHY should Boris reinstate the Remainers who crippled him We’re all for a Tory Party with a range of opinions on most issues.

So clubs will get prize money for the first time and be able to channel the rewards of their success on the pitch into new jobs, including more professional coaches.”Former England ladies’ captain Kelly Smith says: “A few years ago, men’s football defined the women’s game — but not any longer.”AT just , Amy Merricks is assistant manager of the Brighton  Hove Albion ladies’ first team.

It made her sound like a celebrity wanting to publicise a new album or movie.“I mean, in reality she is a celebrity. She’s very familiar with magazines and social media and PR — she prides herself in the knowledge she has.”Officially the company will now be working Stateside on the new Sussex Royal charity foundation, which Meghan and Harry formed following their split with Prince William and Kate.But it means the couple now have access to American PR and crisis management experts on their payroll whenever they want advice.That’s even though they already have well-regarded global PR chief Sara Latham — who was a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton’s  presidential campaign — working for them at Buckingham Palace.Another royal source added: “This is Meghan’s way of being able to get a Hollywood answer to a questionshe’s not hearing what she wants to from the Palace.“But that’s a dangerous precedent to set because there is a reason why courtiers and advisers treat members of the Royal Family dferently — they are not celebrities, they are publicly funded official figures with a formal role.“And they need to hear the truth, evenit’s not the answer they want. That’s something Harry does not like and Meghan isn’t familiar with from her former career.“They appear tone-deaf to criticism at times, which was proven this week by Harry in Amsterdam and by Meghan going to New York and not Balmoral.”But Meghan is said to be concern­ed the public is turning on her after damaging revelations over her relationship with her estranged father Thomas Markle, stories about her negative relationship with William and Kate, and hypocrisy over taking private jets while claiming she is an eco-warrior.The clearest suggestion Meghan is choosing to ignore formal advice is shown by the growing influence of her secret team in Hollywood.Gersh is one of the leading agencies in Hollywood, with many Oscar winners and major TV stars in their client roster including Kristen Stewart, Adam Driver, Tobey Maguire and Jamie Foxx.A separate senior royal insider revealed: “Courtiers at the Palace are aware of these three men working in some capacity for Meghan on the quiet. They have been involved in her finances which is understandable given her former work in America.What’s worrying is their role in ongoing projects like her children’s book, which would usually be handled by Palace staff.“But she’s learning how dferent le inside the Royal Family is compared to her previous career. There are times she feels frustrated.”There is a growing feeling within royal circles that Meghan could be preparing to spend at least part of the year back in Calornia in the future.Prince Harry has already announced his first major TV project will be produced by Oprah Winfrey’s com­pany for US giant Apple’s new streaming service.But senior Palace staff hope a plan for the couple to spend part of the year living in South Africa will stop them getting restless and unhappy in the UK.The royal source added: “From just a few months after the royal wedding there has been a growing drum­beat about Harry and Meghan moving to the US eventually.That’s one of the reasons they are being encouraged to spend time in South Africa because it’s a Commonwealth country and keeps them part of the fold.”Some Palace staff wish Meghan had taken an exten­ded maternity leave after Archie’s birth so the goodwill from the public and media initially granted to her ed. But in fairness to Meghan, her allies point out that isn’t her style.A source close to the Duchess explained: “Meghan is a working woman. She has spent her le using her talent, ambition and desire to create a successful career.“She loves being busy and her intention was never to disappear because she became a mum.“She wants to prove herself and doesn’t want to let criticism or tradition change what she sees as her purpose in le.”You could argue that Meghan has never hidden her ambition.During her televised engagement interview, Meghan artfully dodged whether she was quitting showbiz altogether.Asked about her career change, she replied: “I do not see it as giving anything up. I see it as a change. It is a new chapter.”But with the criticism of the couple’s unconventional behaviour growing, it’s as yet unclearthe unlikely love story of the B-list Hollywood actress and beloved English prince has a happy ending. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think it’s the Spitfire. And neither of us is going to sht. Ever.So here we are. We cannot do a reasonable deal with Europe because our No Deal bargaining chip has been taken away.The Prime Minister can’t do anything meaningful because he doesn’t command a majority. And he isn’t even allowed to call a General Election.I understand why Remainers are doing everything in their power to delay our departure from the EU for as long as possible. And I understand why this is making Brexiteers so furious.Me  I’ve reached the point where I’m past caring. I just want something to happen and so long as Corbyn is kept out of No  Downing Street, I don’t really care what.Sadly, the only way forward is to crawl across the Channel on our hands and knees and literally beg for a deadline extension to next February. Or June. Or the year .And then what  Europe will either offer us the same deal that’s already been rejected by Parliament three times or they will offer us something worse.We are — and there’s no other word for it — f***ed.Right up to the moment when there is a General Election Corbyn will win.And then we will come to know what being f***ed really means.To prevent that, we must do what any right-thinking person does in a time of real emergency and turn for guidance to the US soap opera Dallas.You see, back in , the American actor Patrick Duffy went on a bit of an ego trip.He’d been the Man From Atlantis and Bobby Ewing in Dallas. He’d even recorded a song that reached No  in the Dutch hit parade.So he obviously figured the world was his oyster and he’d be the new Al Pacino.It didn’t work out well. The only role he got was as a goat in a TV movie no one watched, so he decided the following year that he’d like to go back to Dallas, the show that made his name.So in order to accommodate his wishes, the scriptwriters decided his death — and every single thing that happened in the  subsequent months — had been a dream.And guess what We bought it. We all turned to one another in our lounges and our sitting rooms and said: “Yup, that seems reasonable.”So this is what I suggest.On Monday morning, David Cameron walks out of Downing Street and says that, having considered all the options, he is NOT going to call a referendum.Andanyone says, “Hang on a minute, what about Article  and Theresa May and the last election ”, we just say: “Nah, mate, you must have been dreaming.”YOU must have noticed that ever since the fire brigade were given those huge pliers that can cut the roof off a car, they always, always, ALWAYS cut the roof off any car that’s been in an accident.“We must, in case one of the occupants has a broken back,” they always say.Yes – but once, a couple who’d been completely uninjured in a minor traffic accident were invited by Plod to shelter from the drizzle in the police car.When the fire brigade arrived – and I’m not making this up – they cut the roof off the police car so the couple could get out again. And it seems they have the same problem in America.Because this week, the comedian Kevin Hart was a passenger in his exquisite and very rare Plymouth Barracuda when it crashed.Fire crews could have pulled him out through the door, so the car could then be repaired.But no. They cut the roof off, so now it can’t.Yup. Kevin will get better soon but his ’Cuda has gone to the great muscle-car graveyard in the sky.MORE evidence that mankind is losing the capacity for reasoned thought came this week when a bunch of “trans-feminist anti-speciesists”Meanwhile, in Syria . . .VISITORS to a new exhibition at the very traditional Royal Academy will find the only door is partially blocked by a naked man and a naked woman.The only solution is to squeeze between them.This begs many questions. But first up, this naked man.He has to spend all day with no clothes on, face to face with an attractive naked woman while people brush past his parts.I do hope he takes, um, precautions every morning. Or it is very likely he’ll become the world’s first human turnstile.WE had more proof this week that animal rights enthusiasts are not completely right in the head.They tried to claim in an advert that wearing wool is just as cruel as wearing fur – forgetting, perhaps, that to make a woolly jumper, the sheep doesn’t actually have to be killed.In fact, you HAVE to shear a sheep before the hot summer begins because very few breeds are capable of moulting by themselves.If you’ve got all that wool lying around, what are you going to do  Throw it away and make a jumper out of . . . nylon Great idea.

But in the past few years his image has become somewhat tarnished.He’s no longer the boy wonder who can do no wrong and this week Brad revealed how he spent  months going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings after his marriage to Angelina Jolie broke down.He was with an all-male AA group and described it as “removing his drinking privileges” — but said it was a “freeing” experience. I suspect he is the kind of straight man who prefers the company of other fellas.He seems far happier just watching baseball on TV with some of his mates than dressed up in a tuxedo at a red-carpet event with a glamorous woman on his arm.There were rumours that his drinking was a factor in wrecking his relationship with Angelina — with accusations of him having a booze-fuelled rant at one of the older kids — and even close pals agreed that he needed help getting back on track.While he has been trying to get his act together — and all credit to him for seeking help —  months down the line Brad is still trying to officially “consciously uncouple” from Angelina.The y orce proceedings and bitter child-custody battle have at times been highly toxic but now we are told it is all being settled behind closed doors. This means that the lawyers will be having a field day and it will be costing an absolute fortune.The whole split will have been incredibly stressful so it’s maybe no wonder Brad sought solace by hitting the bottle. But let’s just take a look at Jenner.It’s hard to believe she was once an object of pity after Brad fell head over heels for Angelina when she was his movie co-star in Mr  Mrs Smith back in .Jenner is now light years from the supposed “woman scorned” who everyone felt desperately sorry for — she is currently right at the very top of her game.Jenner has turned  and appears on the current cover of Instyle magazine, glowing with health and happiness and looking at least two decades younger.As well as the famous split with Brad, she didn’t have the easiest time finding her feet in Hollywood. After Friends came to an end, her film career failed to take off and then stalled with a series of pretty dire rom-coms.To her credit, Jenner bounced back spectacularly with a string of hits and critically acclaimed roles — in movies such as Cake, Mother’s Day, Dumplin’ and, most recently, Murder Mystery.Although none of her post-Brad relationships lasted the distance and her marriage to Justin Theroux ended in orce, Jenner now seems very comfortable in her own skin.She has said before that she doesn’t want people to feel she needs their sympathy and that she is extremely happy with her le. She is clearly frustrated at being labelled the “deserted we” and has long since made her peace with Brad.So much so that he was a guest at her th birthday party and they are friends — with real affection for one another. Brad and Angelina have always insisted they got together after his marriage to Jenner was in trouble, but all couples go through bad patches and you do have to wonder just what would have happenedMr  Mrs Smith had never been made.Perhaps Brad and Jen would have been able to talk through any tensions and misunderstandings and save their relationship. A lot of people would like to see these two back together again, but I reckon Brad is now carrying too much baggage for a woman such as Jenner.Who would have thought she would end up being the stronger of the two  They do say the best revenge is living a good le — and Jenner is the proof of that.SHE looked frail and unsteady at times walking up Downing Street to No  but Barbara Windsor’s glorious smile never faded. The -year-old was on a mission as she delivered a letter to Boris Johnson calling on him to improve dementia care.It was typical Barbara, drawing on every ounce of her strength and resilience to make sure the needs of dementia sufferers are heard. Leaning on the arm of devoted husband Scott, above, who has been her rock since her Alzheimer’s diagnosis, it was heartening to see glimpses of the Barbara we all love.She was immaculately made up and her trademark blonde beehive was teased higher than ever. She smiled, waved and joked with everyone, but you could seeshe was exhausted as well as exhilarated. Seeing Barbara and Scott together – and the tender way he takes care of her – is so moving.This vile disease might be cruelly robbing him of the woman he loves, but the two of them endeavour to make the most of every day and they are doing a vital job in raising money and awareness so one day we might even conquer dementia.What a tribute that would be to one of the most delightful women I’ve ever been lucky enough to come across.MY thoughts are with Alexandra Burke and her footballer partner Angus MacDonald, who has been diagnosed with bowel cancer at the heartbreakingly young age of .The Hull City defender is a fit sportsman and the news proves this hellish disease can strike down anyone. I hope the cancer has been caught early and he will go on to make a full recovery with singer Alexandra by his side.It’s going to be a very tough time for them both – but I hope all the support and good wishes being sent their way will be of some help and comfort.I’M a bit bemused that Harry and Meghan have apparently declined an invitation to his granny’s Highland home, saying baby Archie is too young.Their four-month-old has already flown to Ibiza for a week on a private jet and is about to go on a long trip to South Africa. By all accounts, there is also an upcoming trip to Calornia so Mum and Dad can go househunting.So to say he’s too small to pop up the road to Scotland seems somewhat disingenuous. The Queen always invites her family to Balmoral to spend part of the summer with her. Princess Anne, Prince Edward and Sophie and princesses Eugenie and Beatrice spent time there last month.The Queen also showed her unquestioning support to Prince Andrew, who is embroiled in the scandal surrounding the late convicted pervert Jeffrey Epstein.William and Kate flew up with their three kids for a family break – somewhat pointedly on a Flybe plane – the day after the Sussexes went on that Ibiza trip in a private jet financed by Uncle Elton.Maybe Meghan simply doesn’t fancy the chilly BBQs and outdoorsy le at Balmoral. Harry’s mum Diana was never a big fan and I wouldn’t blame Meghan for not wanting to be part of the hunting, shooting and fishing brigade. But it’s the excuse of Archie being too young that doesn’t ring true.It was the same with Harry’s response to their flights on private jets when preaching to us all about reducing our carbon footprints. He claimed it was to protect his family but big bro William will one day be king and he took Kate and their three children on a commercial airline to Scotland.As I’ve said before, Harry and Meghan have good intentions and a lot to offer. They could do so much good but they seem to have lost their way and there is a growing disconnect between them and us that is really sad.WHAT the feck have we all done in a previous le to deserve the complete and utter balls-up currently being played out in our parliament  It makes the deranged and sweary TV comedy The Thick Of It look like a sensible political documentary.We have become a country full of people who are either permanently angry or completely and utterly fed up to the back teeth of the whole Brexit debacle.

And that reveals two things about Corbyn’s mob:First, they HAVE finally decided to abandon all their Leave voters. Second, they intend to insult their intelligence too, by assuming them too dim to see through such a transparent con-trick.Labour should simply state: “In power, we would scrap Brexit.” Yes, it would be shameful and, in a country where trust in politicians is already nearly the ­lowest in Europe, insanely dangerous.But at least Corbyn would for once be telling the truth.CAN the world’s worst loser Gina Miller really not hear her own revolting hypocrisy “I will not give up the fight for democracy,” she bleats as her legal bid to stop the PM suspending Parliament is chucked out.This is a rich woman using her millions to meddle in politics while refusing to stand for election. A woman bent on overturning the biggest mandate in our history because she doesn’t like it.A woman whose Remainer pals are running scared of an election Boris Johnson might win.The only vote they want is a second referendum biased for Remain. Butthey can get away with simply cancelling Brexit, all the better.Here’s the only democracy Miller likes:One where she and her powerful, know-all London friends get their way — and the ignorant little people can go to hell.“ANY EU citizens in Britain legally must be told unequivocally they can stay.”So said The Sun just after the  referendum. It was Vote Leave’s stance too.It is still Boris Johnson’s position now.“Under this Government,” he says, “they will have the absolute certainty for the right to live and remain.”Applying to stay is pretty straight- forward. Many have done so. But the number falling prey to Home Office carelessness or negligence is appalling.No one who has lived and worked here legally for years should be suddenly sent letters wrongly declaring them ineligible.

He was charming, witty and fun to debate with.I think some women around the union or Oxford University Conservative Association were head over heels for him.Even today his is thought of as rather dishy in Tory circles with Made in Cha star turned Politico, Georgia Toffolo, describing him as a sex god.An unsurprisingly precocious child, JRM was interviewed on the today programme about finance when he was just -years-old.The keen capitalist, who already read the Financial Times daily and attended company shareholder meetings, was happy to appear on the programme for a fee in .Young Jacob asked the beeb to fork out £ for the interview and when they failed to cough up sent a letter threatening legal action.He wrote: “Dear Today programme, you are in a debt of £ which was payable as from   .“I have no idea what your excuse is but I will not accept it. If it is not received by    which is nearly two months, I shall increase it to £.“If it is not received within  days I shall take legal advice. I hope it does not come to that for I have no desire to prosecute the BBC.”When asked about the incident by The Sun last year, Jacob, now , described it as an error of his misspent youth.A friend who knows both Jacob and Louise claims that the chick lit author turned politico told them that Rees-Mogg had proposed to her but she said no.The pair were very close friends at Oxford and allegedly Louise seriously considered the proposal before turning them down.She would eventually go on to marry Anthony  LoCicero in  but orce him nine years later before hooking up with her current hubby, US businessman Peter Mensch.Jacob and Louise remain close to this day and are Godparents to one anothers children.A fan of the finer things in le, when Jacob was packed of to Eton as a -year-old he discovered he was unhappy with the bedding provided by the prestigious school.As a result, the future MPs now famous nanny, made frequent visits to the Berkshire public school to make his bed.Young Jacob preferred his own linen to the standard issue sheets doled out at the £,-per-year school.During his Far Eastern adventure in the world of Hong Kong finance, Moggy apparently got cosy with a young lady named Maria Butler.The pair apparently dined out together a few times and it seemed like one of the more serious relationships Jacob had had with a woman.But apparently the budding would be romance, which never became physical, was cut short after devoutly Catholic Jacob discovered Maria had been orced following a brief, ill-fated marriage in her early s. History buff Jacob once changed the last four digits of his phone number to , the year of Charles Is execution, to make it easier to remember.He revealed during an interview at the London Palladium with the Spectator that he opted for the number after moving into a new home.Jacob, who read history at Oxford, said: It’s important to have telephone numbers that people can remember.Soyou say to people ‘-the death of Charles I’ they know exactly what to call.As a great British politician, Mr Rees-Mogg obviously opted for a great British Motor.Jacobs dad, Times editor William Rees-Mogg spied a rather nice  T-Series Bentley first owned by former England cricket captain Gubby Allen.Following his death in , Gubby’s papers went on sale at an auction attended by Jacob’s father, a former Editor of The Times and a collector of rare books.It was there that he saw Gubby’s old car for sale and contacted the -year-old Jacob about a potential purchase.Jacob said: “Neither my father nor I knew anything about cars, but we dutully looked under the bonnet and there was an engine there but beyond that, our technical skills were not very great.I bid for it and got it and then realised that enjoying the car was probably going to cost almost as much as buying it”"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit latest gove puts 1600 troops on standby to keep fuel flowing in case of no deal","story":"Secret bunkers are reportedly being filled

two nautical miles off the port city of Tartus on Syrias Mediterranean coast.The UKs Foreign Office said in a statement that reports about the ships location were deeply troubling, and that for Iran to renege on its assurances would be a violation of international norms and a morally bankrupt course of action.The Stena Impero was seized on July  and footage showed balaclava-clad Iranian commandos abseil onto its deck.Irans Revolutionary Guard launched a gunboat and helicopter raid on the tanker, which is registered in the UK, claiming it had turned off its tracker and ignored warnings.Another

As Her Majesty is above politics, she would not have taken her PM to task for the shambles he’s making of her country. But we know how you feel, Ma’am. All but diehard Boris fanatics will be relieved when he is gone too. He makes even Theresa May look statesmanlike. She had some awful weeks, but even her worst was not as bad as Mr Johnson’s last one. Mr Johnson lost every Commons vote – and a little brother. Jeremy Corbyn ripped him apart in PMQs. And no prime minister can be forgiven for that rambling, cringeworthy, ­incoherent speech to police cadets. No wonder one of them collapsed. Mr Johnson is making error after error, prompted by sidekick Dominic Cummings. If this nasty little guttersnipe has any redeeming qualities he keeps them well-hidden. His advice to sack  senior Tories shows him incapable of reading Parliament. His ­foul-mouthed rants prove he’s incapable of handling people. When a delegation of MPs demands Mr Johnson gets rid of this “political anarchist”, as John Major called him, the PM should listen. Mr Johnson is boxed in. He cannot have a no-deal Brexit. He cannot get any Brexit at all by October . And his laughable plan to ­paralyse the EU will have its  other leaders splitting their sides. This newspaper respects the referendum result. But we believe no-deal would be a disaster. Last week the Sunday Mirror urged Jeremy Corbyn and other opposition leaders to work together. And look what they achieved when they did. The Queen can take comfort that when she holidays at Balmoral next year she will not have Boris Johnson to put up with. There will be another PM in his place.

It was March  and she had recently given birth to her first child, Rowan. Rachael and her husband Aaron, now , were hardly sleeping, but their little boy was so perfect that they happily accepted the sleepless nights. The new family began to settle into a routine, but  days after Rowan was born, Rachael started to feel strange. ‘One minute I was drenched in sweat, the next I was shivering with cold,’ she recalls. ‘I thought it was natural for new mums to experience hot and cold flushes, but lying in bed that night I was shaking uncontrollably.’ Rachael was still under the care of her midwe, so Aaron called the local delivery suite who advised her to go in for a check-up. Aaron, a carpenter, drove Rachael to hospital, taking baby Rowan with them. ‘We arrived at midnight,’ says Rachael. ‘I was so exhausted, I felt like I was in a trance.    aposMy skin was pale and mottled and two midwives took me away to do tests. aposBecause my oxygen levels were dropping, I needed to use breathing apparatus. aposI felt so disoriented.’ When one of the midwives told her she had an infection and needed antibiotics, dazed Rachael was taken to a room on the delivery ward and hooked up to an IV. ‘I was shaking uncontrollably again, but still managed to breast-feed Rowan with Aaron holding him for me,’ she remembers. Facing death The next five days passed in a blur. Rachael was closely monitored while her body was pumped with eight dferent types of antibiotics to fight the infection. Gradually, her trance-like stupor began to lt and she was moved to another ward and given yet another dose of antibiotics. Dazed, Rachael asked a nurse what had happened to her, and was astonished when the nurse gently explained that she was lucky to be alive after battling sepsis. If she had waited just another  hours, she could have died.    ‘It was the first time I’d ever heard sepsis mentioned and I was stunned,’ says Rachael. ‘After being discharged  hours later, the first thing I did was start researching the illness.’ Rachael learned her bout of sepsis was caused by the immune system’s overreaction to an infection or injury. Instead of fighting the infection, her immune system had attacked her body’s organs and tissues. If she hadn’t been diagnosed early on, her organs could have failed. ‘It didn’t make sense. aposI’d always been strong, fit and healthy,’ says Rachael. ‘I was shaken by how close I’d come to leaving my baby and husband forever.’ Rachael learned from The UK Sepsis Trust website that survivors also grappled with Post Sepsis Syndrome , which could leave them feeling exhausted, anxious and depressed. Unfortunately, there was no treatment. ‘I felt tired, I was afraid I was failing Rowan as a mother,’ says Rachael. ‘I had faced death without even realising it, which was a lot to deal with. aposI retreated into myself, and worried I was being a burden.’  Thankfully, Aaron was amazing and Rachael’s parents, Mark and Linda, also helped with Rowan. Eight months later, she started to feel like herself again and the family went on holiday to the Lake District. ‘The holiday helped me come to terms with what had happened and made me realise how lucky I was,’ she says. ‘Sepsis is often confused with gastroenteritis or flu, and the symptoms can show up dferently – I was fortunate my nurses had immediately known what was wrong. aposI had been saved by an early diagnosis and I wanted to help others.’ Rachael decided to raise awareness for The UK Sepsis Trust, and began to plan a sponsored hike in the Brecon Beacons. But in October , a year and a half after her first diagnosis, she began feeling short of breath and her temperature fluctuated. Knowing that there was a risk of recurrence with sepsis, she put -month-old Rowan down for a nap and waited for Aaron to come home. Rapid deterioration ‘I didn’t want to put Rowan through another trip to AE, so I insisted on going to the hospital alone,’ she says. ‘Aaron planned to follow later, but things deteriorated rapidly. aposI felt so poorly and powerless.  aposI knew my le was at risk and I was terried. aposThe doctors reviewed my medical records and I was given a bed in the acute medical unit, but things weren’t moving quickly enough. aposI pleaded with them to start treatment.’ Rachael lost consciousness and was hooked up to IV antibiotics again. ‘When I came round, all I could think about was Rowan. aposI had to keep fighting for my little boy,’ she says. ‘I still had a very high temperature of ºC and my doctors said I might need to be placed in an induced coma while they tried to stabilise me. aposFortunately, they regulated my temperature by wrapping me in ice, then putting a heat blanket over the top. aposI begged the nurses not to let me die. ‘I couldn’t believe this was happening again. aposI was confined to my bed, receiving the same treatment as before. aposAaron brought Rowan to visit, but he was too scared to come near me because I was hooked up to wires, looking so unwell and not myself.’ After four days of treatment, Rachael cried tears of relief as doctors managed to control the sepsis. ‘I thought about all the people who hadn’t been as lucky – either they’d lost limbs to sepsis or gone into septic shock.’  Rachael found out tonsillitis had caused her sepsis, as her weakened immune system had been unable to fight the common infection. ‘Outwardly I looked OK, but inside I was suffering. aposI struggled with muscle weakness and fatigue and had to take time off from my job as an NHS support worker,’ she says. ‘My le had been turned upside down and I was fearful of getting ill again.’ Luckily, a kind nurse from The UK Sepsis Trust helped Rachael process her fears and feel less alone, telling her it was normal to feel sad and not suffer in silence. Gradually, Rachael built up strength and recovered emotionally and physically. In June , she and Aaron completed a km trek for The UK Sepsis Trust, raising more than £. ‘I was ready to take on the world again, but sadly in April this year I was struck down by sepsis for a third time, she says. ‘I told Rowan that Mummy had a bug and needed help from the hospital to remove it from her body. aposI was  weeks’ pregnant with my second baby and, because I had flu, I was quarantined for six days. ‘I came out the other side again but I hope this is the last time I have to face this battle. aposI’m still recovering and I’ve experienced some hair loss, which is another effect of PSS.’ Helping others Rachael wanted to give something back and to let others know help is available and, since November , she’s been working for the NHS  Service hoping to help others spot the early symptoms. It’s been a tough few years for Rachael, but things are now looking up. ‘Our baby is due in October and Rowan is starting school. aposI’m looking to the future and I don’t want to miss a moment with my beautul children,’ she says. ‘I’m so grateful to be a survivor.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"babys eczema extreme mum couldnt","story":"NewsBabys eczema was so extreme that his mum couldnt give him a cuddleThe tot, from Warrington, had to be covered in a strong ointment usually used for adults and wrapped in bandages for three weeksShareByOlivia WilliamsLorraine King:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror lestyle health video what-is-eczema-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

His inquest on Friday heard he had been taking the drug for  years but the effects had started to be worse than his anxiety and he wanted to give it up.And on the eve of his nd birthday, the DJ took his own le at a car park, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports today. Speaking at the inquest, Jacksonaposs heartbroken mum Viv said: The effects had started to be worse than his anxiety. But you can’t come off it – that’s the problem.    The hearing was told Jackson suffered from seasonal affective disorderand had a longstanding habit of altering the amount of medication he took without consulting doctors. The inquest was told there was a ‘possibility’ his decision to wean himself off Seroxat placed him at increased risk of suicide. It emerged Jackson had not asked doctorshe could come off the drug. The evidence led to North Staffordshire coroner Andrew Barkley recorded a conclusion of suicide and said it was a ‘concern’ that Jackson was ‘making his own adjustments’ to his medication. That is a signicant risk in that it can give rise to a relapse, he said.

Jon Mitchell, his partner and kids have been squeezed into the temporary accommodation more than  miles from their old home. They were ordered to leave that two-bed property in Erdington, north Birmingham, after falling into rent arrears due to the benefit cap. But Birmingham Live says Jon and his children - aged , , ,  and  - have now been rehoused miles away from their relatives and the childrensapos schools. Birmingham City Council, which is controlled by the Labour Party, currently has , families on their waiting list amid a national housing crisis.    Itaposs one room, me, my partner and my five children. Iaposve rang the council numerous times and they said theyaposre going to put us up in an emergency accommodation, the -year-old dad said. His family have been cooped up in the new room in Northfield, southwest Birmingham, since June . Jon, who is unemployed, added: Itaposs got a double bed, a single bed, a bunk bed, a cot, a microwave, a fridge and a telly. You canapost swing a cat in here. Weaposre being treated worse than animals. Weaposre spending more money here than we did when we had the two-bedroom property because we have to buy food daily as all we have is a microwave. Youaposre not allowed to use the garden or the cooker due to health and safety, weaposre just stuck in a little room.  Jon and his partner, who support their large family with job seekers allowance and benefits, claim theyaposve been left more than  miles away from the childrensapos Erdington schools. They must leave their room at .am for their y three-bus journey to their schools. Andmade to pay the new rent at the hotel, Jon says the family will be left with aposnothingapos. He explained: The previous flat needed some repair in but it was close to the kidaposs school, now weaposre three buses away from their school. We have to leave here at .am to get the children all the way to Erdington to their school.  Itaposs costing us way more than it should be, with the £ bus fares and having to buy food daily as we have nowhere to cook. Now the council is sending us letters that they want £ a week for the emergency accommodation. Iaposm not paying more than £ a week for one room. I wouldnapost do that, no way. If we were going to pay them the rent here, after taking out the food daily and the bus fares, we would have nothing. Birmingham City Council said Mr Mitchellaposs household income aposgreatlyapos surpassed the £, housing benefit cap and that he failed to pay his rent. The council said he was given support from BCC financial , debt and housing services, Shelter, the Citizens Advice Bureau and Social Services, but they claim he still did not comply with orders to make payments to reduce his rent debt. It was taken to Birmingham County Court on June , at which point the family were evicted due to a long history of debt. If you are struggling to manage debt, don’t ignore things.

But now the -year-old has a whole new a-gender… she has just given birth to her th child – a baby girl. Cradling her new arrival last night, the proud mum said: “We’re over the moon. “I’d been expecting to hear we were having another boy. But when I found out it was a girl, my face was a picture. “I was shocked, but delighted. Now she’s here with us, it’s a fantastic feeling.” And daughter Cameron has already had a remarkable effect on her brothers, who range in age from two to .    Dad David, , a train driver, said: “They’ve generally been much better behaved around her, trying to keep quiet in case they wake her up. “They also want to help with holding and feeding her – it’s been great.” The couple insist Cameron marks the completion of their family, which also includes Campbell, , Harrison, , Corey, , Lachlan, , Brodie, nine, Brahn, eight, Hunter, six, Mack, five, Blake, three, and Rothagaidh, two.  “We’re definitely stopping now,’” laughs Alexis. “There’ll be no more. I said that last time, but this time I absolutely mean it. I love my family as it is now. “Of course, we do get comments about the number of children we have – especially when I was pregnant again. “But it doesn’t bother me what people think, we’re well used to it. Some people think we must be on benefits, but we’re not. David has a good job, which means we don’t even qualy for full child benefit.”  It was Christmas Eve, as the family were all getting over a sickness bug, that Alexis realised hers seemed to be lingering longer than everyone ’s – and took a home pregnancy test to confirm the news. But this time the couple, from Dingwall in the Scottish Highlands, decided not to wait until the birth to find out the sex – and instead had a gender scan at a clinic  miles away in Elgin, Moray. Alexis, who has spent more than eight of the last  years pregnant, said: “When the results came, Harrison opened the envelope, I was too nervous. We were amazed it was a girl.” But only child Alexis is adamant she was not holding out for a daughter. She said: “All my sons are special to me –another boy had been on the way it wouldn’t have bothered me. We’re asked a lotwe had so many children because we were hoping for that elusive girl. “I can honestly answer ‘no’. Cameron wasn’t planned, but I was happy all the same. Luckily all my pregnancies have had little or no drama.    “I’d never planned to have a large family, but now I do, I love it. “I always joked I wouldn’t have a clue what to do with a girl… that’s all changed. We’re having a lot of fun buying pink things for the first time.” Alexis reckons she is “immune” to most birth control – and is now contemplating getting sterilised. After Cameron’s birth  days ago, she plans toto her new job as a part-time fitness instructor in a few weeks. Her day usually begins at .am, an hour after David goes off to work – she uses the “quiet” time for a coffee and a shower before the children start to emerge for nursery and school. Alexis does  laundry loads a week, and vacuums seven times a day. She said: “It’s not easy with so many boys running around, but I like everything neat and tidy. I can’t stand mess.”  As she speaks, her youngest boy drops crumbs as he munches a Mini Roll – and out comes the dustpan. David, diagnosed six years ago with early onset Parkinson’s, is a hands-on dad, sharing the housekeeping duties. Despite his daily health battle, he says of his huge family: “I wouldn’t have it any other way. I always try to have time for each of our boys. “Medication helps with the symptoms, which are thankfully still minor. “It’s dficult to have a holiday as one group, that’s not happened for years. “The seven-week school summer holidays can also be an endurance test – most of the time they’re just happy on their Xbox or Wii Switch.” Just inside the front door of the family’s five-bedroom detached home, around  pairs of Adidas and Vans trainers, as well as school shoes and Hunter wellies of all sizes, are stacked neatly on a shoe rack.

But the start of the new term may mean theof some real little nasties - head lice. Dermatologists are warning parents to have their nit combs at the ready as little onesto classes and their pals. Research from  found that  per cent of children had had head lice in the past five years and it most commonly affects kids between six and nine. But experts say the more prepared parents are the quicker the problem can be resolved - and the less likely it is that the lice will get the chance to spread to other family members.  But now thereaposs a new head lice threat known as super head lice. These are strains of the parasite which are resistant to traditional chemical insecticides. So the British Association of Dermatologists has provided some simple steps for preparing for and managing an outbreak. Hereaposs what you should be doingyouaposre little one is struck down by head lice. . Make sure that you have the essentials at home already - and all you need is a large bottle of conditioner and a nit comb. . Check for nits pre-emptively at home using a nit comb to identy infestation early, prompt treatment helps prevent further spread.    . If you do find evidence of nits, get to work with the nit comb. Soak wet hair with a generous amount of conditioner to make the procedure easier. You should then comb through all the hair from the roots to the ends. Depending on the hair type and , the wet combing process can take up to  minutes. The comb must be immediately cleaned after each pass to remove lice and eggs. This is best done by wiping on clean white paper or cloth. And check family members for head lice – they may have spread. . To ensure all head lice are removed, you should repeat this wet combing process two or three times within the first two weeks following infestation.    . Continue to check for head lice every week for a month to ensure that they have not ed. Holly Barber of the British Association of Dermatologists said: Although it’s important for parents to be prepared for the increased risk of head lice infestation in their children ahead of the new school year, chemical treatments shouldn’t be used as a preventative measure. This can encourage the resistant head lice to develop, making them even harder to get rid of. Instead, the British Association of Dermatologists recommends regular examinations with a nit comb in order to detect an infestation early, as starting treatment sooner rather than later will help prevent further spread. Parents should also keep in mind that head lice can spread to anybody, no matter how clean their hair or home is.

She kissed and hugged the man before showing him in the store and the man let the store around  minutes later. She allegedly told her client in a text message seen by : Iaposll meet you at the back door and let you in and take you to the staff room. Iaposve done a few jobs i there itaposs so easy. Well I do volunteer work got make some money and have some fun [sic].    It is understood that Zayna, who has been on the Jeremy Kyle show, started volunteering at the shop two years ago. She revealed in the programme last year how she had slept with a Co-op Funeralcare worker after he booked her to come to the funeral home. Zayna has previously admitted she has tried to quit the sex industry several times but said she struggles to find employment where because of her past.

And it turns out even the Royals get tempted by the Peri-Peri goodness, and both Princes William and Harry have spoken about their love for it a number of times. Prince Harry was introduced to the South African chain a few years back by his personal protection officer and has been spotted at the chain several times, including a midnight visit to the restaurant in Fulham Broadway, south west London in . Harry, who was  at the time, forked out £. on his takeaway dinner for himself and a friend at .pm on a Tuesday night. Two members of the Prince’s personal security sat patiently behind him while he waited more than  minutes for his Portuguese inspired grub to be prepared.    Harry was seen fidgeting with his mobile phone and making animated hand gestures to his mate as the pair killed time to distract themselves from hunger. A stunned onlooker said: “It was surreal. He was very charming and politely refused a member of staff who approached him for a picture. I was gobsmacked to see him.” Another witness added: “Moments after he left the restaurant clutching his dinner in a paper bag a member of staff jumped on the bench the Harry was sitting on and shouted: “I’m on the Prince’s throne!’ Nobody could believe what happened.”    However not everyone will be particularly impressed by what the royal ordered from the Nandoaposs menu. He ordered a pitta with extra cheese and a side of creamy mash, along with a double chicken wrap with chips. He also got a soft drink and bottle of water. However the pitta was lemon and herb, the chainaposs mildest offering which many people see as a terrible order. It’s unclear whether Harry – who wore a green polo shirt, denim jeans and a baseball cap partially disguising his face according to a witness - paid full price for the grub or took advantage of the  per cent discount the chicken-chain offers to military personnel.    After picking up their order Harry, who was dating Cressida Bonas at the time, and his pal casually exited through the car park which is connected with the building. The late night visit wasn’t his first trip to Nandos. He ordered a similar meal in Stevenage in  with a group of Army friends at a branch near their Hertfordshire base. And Harry isnapost the only royal who likes a cheeky Nandoaposs, and his brother Prince William has also spoken about his love for the chicken in the past.

The mother of Rhys Williams, , issued an appeal for people to send him a card in a desperate bid to show him he has something to fight for. The youngster had told his mum Tanya that he wishes a butterfly would come and take him away. Thousands of birthday cards poured in after -year-oldaposs plea touched the hearts of well-wishers from across the world.    Rhys is living in constant pain as he battles a rare le-limiting and agonising skin condition, known as epidermolysis bullosa. The rare inherited condition, which heaposs suffered from since birth, results in painful skin blisters, sores and has even caused his fingers to fuse together. In just a few days, he has received more than , cards as well as parcels and hundreds of online messages in time for his th birthday on September . Tanya was left struggling to close her front door after the cards and parcels began to pile up - so many so that a post van arrived at Rhysapos home just for him.    His mum started to realise how far the appeal had reached when her breakfast was interrupted by a call from Liverpool Football Clubaposs Peter Moore. The chief executive offered free box tickets to her Liverpool-mad son when he read the heartbreaking story. Tanya, , from Bolton, Greater Manchester, says her son has a smile on his face again ahead of his birthday thanks to the kindness of thousands of people. She said: He is loving it, he is so happy. It restores your faith in humanity.Iaposve had thousands of messages on Facebook , I try and answer each one. Itaposs fab. All the cards are just as nice and kind as the next. His favourite present so far has got to be his gaming headphones and Xbox game from someone in LA. He has just had a card from the Doctor Who production, heaposs had cards from football clubs, supermarkets. Rhys has not been able to wipe the smile off his face. Heaposs been so happy. Everything is in the living room at the moment. Twenty-one boxes were delivered on Saturday and Iaposve only just been able to shut my front door. We have received about , cards just today . We got three-and-a-half thousand on Friday. I can only just see my living room floor. He is opening each card and reading it, and heaposs got his friend opening them too. He is taking his time with each one which is why it is taking so long.  Since Tanya first made her appeal, Rhysaposs story has gone international - with some of the cards arriving from the other side of the world. She has also been contacted by a number of organisations who want to do something nice for Rhys, including Bolton Wanderers FC, who have asked him to act as a mascot. Tanya added: Itaposs gone worldwide. Heaposs been on the telly in Chile. He got a card from Qatar today and loads from America. Itaposs just gone everywhere. I just want to say thank you. Thataposs all I can really say at the moment, Iaposm so overwhelmed by it all. At birth, his carers, mum and dad, Mark, , had no idea whether he would ever reach his teenage years. The condition causes Rhysapos skin and internal tissue to blister at the slightest knock or rub, leaving him with painful open wounds. He is now reliant on a wheelchair as he is unable to straighten his legs due to the fusing of the skin at the back of his knees.

Incredibly, both Hazel and her mum were safe and she continued to take her driving test the following morning and passed with just three minors.    She said: “A lot of people are shocked that I went ahead with my test, but I just plucked up the courage and tried to forget about the incident. “I was in complete disbelief when I passed but I couldn’t be prouder, my dad Joe, , told me it would be best for me to get back on it and he was right. “Even after the incident, I continued to my final driving lesson, I was a bit shaken with a headache and sore jaw, but it was fine. “I had completed  hours of lessons and was familiar with the country lane and I am comfortable to go around those bends in fourth gear at a maximum speed of mph maximum.  “As I began to slow down for the bend, the car behind didn’t so I was aware the driver was going to overtake, but It looked like he was going to hit me, so I swerved and hit the grass verge. “My mum yelled my name to alert me about going onto the verge, but it was too late, my car was already doing its own thing. “We were heading towards a rusted metal pole in the field and I tried my hardest to make a harsh right turn and slammed the breaks on to avoid the pole injuring my mum. “My efforts weren’t enough and we hit the pole, and then inevitably the car flipped onto the roof. “I don’t remember my le flashing, but I do remember that in that moment, I just started crying, thinking ‘I’m going to lose my mum, I can’t lose my mum’. “When the windscreen started cracking my mum screamed, I was just glad she was OK.” After calling her dad to explain what had happened, the three of them got out of the car and paramedics arrived shortly after, who found Hazel and her passengers had suffered minor injuries. But despite the crash, Hazel was still determined to take a lesson with Perry Dennis School of Motoring, ahead of her test the next day.

Others play poker and drink whiskey in the saloon while the womenfolk cook over glowing ­embers or make new dresses. With wood to be chopped daily and the nights lit by candles and paraffin lamps, le is hard here. But no one in town would dream of complaining. Welcome to Laredo in the Wild West... of Britain. Sited a few miles from London, it is a retreat where cowboy enthusiasts get to live the dream. Membership is select and ­outsiders are forbidden at the ­secret location in Kent. Phones, computers and modern clothes – in fact, ­anything a cowboy would not have had – are also banned.    The mother and daughter who run the town live just off-site with electricity but they give it up for two weekends every month. “We are Britain’s only real-le mother-daughter cowgirls,” Jolene Truder says proudly as Scarlet, , helps her prepare dinner. “We help people live out their dreams of the Wild West lestyle and are obsessed with it.”    The Sunday People got exclusive access to Laredo – a town of  historically accurate buildings founded by Jolene’s father John, in . Scarlet, a Year  pupil, is helping Jolene carry on his legacy alongside the  members of the Laredo Western Club. She said: “I know most girls my age are into social media and Love Island. But I love le as a cowgirl. I feel lucky to be born into this. I don’t tell the kids at school. They used to bully me when they found out. But I know I’m the one who gets to have more fun.”  Jolene, a school cover supervisor, introduced Scarlet to cowgirl le as a baby, as John did with her  years ago. Son Morgan, , took part too until he went to university. The girls and the other members, who includes only three other ­women, have worked hard to make Laredo a true Wild West town. All of the buildings, including a hotel, a saloon, a blacksmith’s, livery stables, a bank and a marshall’s office, were built ­exactly as they would have been between  and .  The oldest, the photographer’s studio and Wells Fargo  Co offices, date to . The hotel took nine years. Jolene says: “It’s a labour of love. As a child, I resented how much time my dad spent working on the town. As I got older I learned about the feminine side – the outfits and hairstyles, cooking and the social things. Soon I was as hooked as he was.”  Jolene has  ­dresses, some homemade and others bought online, many imported from the US. Scarlet has  outfits. “You can sew a cotton dress for about £,” Jolene says. “Buying costs £ to £. All materials are natural – cottons, wool, silk. We do hair in traditional styles and keep jewellery authentic.”  Daily le back then was harder in almost every way – a lesson Jolene is proud to have instilled in Scarlet. She says: “Just making a cup of tea can take a half an houryou don’t have a fire ­waiting for the kettle. “After a few days, you’re knackered and ready toto ­modern comforts.” John, or JT as he was known, originally bred horses on the Laredo land. In the late s he and some pals built a cabin and corral.  Eventually, they launched the Laredo Western Club. John died in , aged , and left the place to Jolene. She says: “He saw it as a living history.” There are two club weekends a month but some members live in their buildings for up to six months.  They come from all walks of le and ­include a health and safety boss, a housing officer, a chip shop owner and a builder. The oldest – Jon Rayner,  – is famed for an ability to drink anyone under the ­table. The only original member is Dave Thompson, . New ones join by word of mouth.  Every person is ­assigned a building to care for. They dress to suit their role and must shed modern kit within an hour of ­arriving. Jolene runs the general store and Ralph Kiddy, , has the bakery. Laredo was open to the public until thieves broke in and caused damage.  The cash for ­running it comes from hiring it out as a film and TV set. In  it was in Johnny Depp flick Finding Neverland. Jolene says Depp was “lovely” when he overheard her swearing at a fellow member who left a mess in one of the rooms. She says: “I started shouting and cursing. I had no idea one of the biggest actors in the world was downstairs. He had a good laugh.” Scarlet was even an extra when Will Ferrell and John C Reilly filmed  hit Holmes and Watson.  But beyond the odd brush with stars, days are spent mostly on chores, broken up by coffee with neighbours. Scarlet says: “One thing I’ve learned is how to have a proper conversation.” Traditional hobbies are the only entertainment until Saturday night, when they have a knees-up in the hotel. Jolene says: “We are like family. People thinks it’s strange me and Scarlet spend so much time with a bunch of – mostly older – men. But it’s like having dozens of doting uncles and grandfathers.

The structure is made of black gemstone jet - a type of lignite - with inlays of semi-precious stones. It was found after the Ala-Tey necropolis, a reservoir near Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam, Russiaaposs biggest power plant, was drained. Experts say the deceased was a fashionable young woman who lived in the Hunnu-erain rural south Russia. It is believed she actually wore the object as a belt buckle. Natasha’s’ burial with a Hunnu-eraiPhone remains one of the most interesting at this burial site. Hers was the only belt decorated with Chinese wuzhu coins which helped us to date it, said Dr Pavel Leus, who led the team of archaeologists in the summer.    Photos of the accessory capture its extraordinary turquoise and red inlays. The buckle, around seven by three and a half inches in size, was discovered in the normally submerged Atlantis necropolis near the dam. The region is Tuva, a largely mountainous sprawl of beautul countryside - a holiday spot frequented regularly by Vladimir Putin. Other graves of prehistoric civilisations dating from the Bronze Age to the time of Genghis Khan are located in the area. Two more partly-mummied prehistoric fashionistas - buried with the tools of their trade - were unearthed earlier this year.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that. I am not retiring, not yet and not in the foreseeable future.”John has the tour to contend with first and is also lining up some television work.And at the age of  there is definitely no holding him back.

It involves learning about dferent cultures, environments and communities to help them where they need it.“The students taking part in the challenge have two years of learning before they go on their trip.“Through this they research their destination, choose their own itinerary and really start to understand why they are going on the trip.“After travelling to Borneo, the young people had a weekend to become acclimatised and training before we took a seven-hour hike into the rainforest where we stayed with  families in a longhouse for seven days and lived with the local community.“The reason for staying there was to help replace a pepper drying rack floor which is vital to the work of locals.“The longhouse is the home of  families and they all have jobs such as pepper farmers, hunters and fishermen. vw, px\"  “During the week spent with the families, the young people helped with pepper farming, rubber tapping and even catching their own lunch as they travelled to a waterfall where the fishermen catch their fish.“What struck all the young people was the huge work ethic and the value of community and family that the locals all have.“What makes the trip dferent is that we weren’t there to just give the community something – we were there to really learn about how they live and also see how important the environment is to them as it is their livelihood. vw, px\"  “At nights with the families we taught them Scottish country dancing and Auld Lang Syne and they taught us some of their traditions.”As well as working with the families in the longhouse, it was up to the students to organise their own travel, food, budgets and activities for the whole trip.This included organising meals where they even harvested and caught their own lunch, and taking part in “tourist” activities while still thinking about the environmental impact and making sure they had enough cash from their budget for train and bus travel.Although Hilda and two leaders from World Challenge were present, the adults were there for safety andthe students didn’t get off the bus at the right time, the adults kept quiet and let the young people work it out. vw, px\"  Hilda added: “What was amazing to watch was the young people changing before our eyes.“They not only thought about the environmental impact but also how they could take their spending power in to the country and go to local restaurants and cafes rather than going to KFC or McDonald’s while in the capital.“We also did our main trek for five nights where we slept in hammocks and made our food on open fires, which the students all prepared, and they had to organise their food before setting off.“They also had to think about what  they were taking into the country such as plastic waste.“Anything they brought that was plastic they had to take home with them, such as toothpaste and shampoo bottles, and they also decided not to buy water in plastic bottles. vw, px\"  “While in Borneo they saw the impact of plastic pollution in the water and it really hit home seeing the problems that we all talk about at home.“Even when they went sea kayaking, which again they had to organise, they all took nets out with them and they collected any plastic they saw.“To me it was so special to see these young people actively think about their impact on the environment and making changes, not because they felt that they were supposed to but because they wanted to.“The children also visited an orangutan conservation area where they were able to see wild orangutans feeding.“They were told about some orphaned babies and learned that one was nicknamed The Dandy.“All of the students decided they would dip into their tight budget and adopt the baby orangutan so they are now all adoptive parents.“It really was an amazing, le-changing experience for them.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d1dba5d3b6627.41351149.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds goal machine shankland fit for arbroath cup tie","story":"Goal machine Lawrence Shankland will be available for Dundee United’s Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup clash with Arbroath this weekend.Shankland made it eight goals in four league starts last Friday as he scored from the spot in the Tangerines’ crushing - derby win over Dundee.There was concern as he limped off  minutes from the end at Tannadice.United, however, have confirmed the problem was nothing serious and the -year-old is back in training this week.“It was just a cramp in his leg he couldn’t get rid of, so we took him off,” said assistant boss Gordon Forrest.“He did a great job in the game but when you look at our bench there are players who can come on and score.“Again it is credit to all the boys who are working hard in training and keeping themselves fit and sharp. When they are called upon, they do a job.”Defender Mark Connolly, who limped off injured during the first half against Dundee, is more of a concern.“Mark had to come off during the game so he is in the early stages of being assessed.“He has had a few little issues with his hamstring in the past, so he just felt it during the match so we had to take him off and make that change.“We will, hopefully, find out over the next few days how long he might be out for.”Forrest, meanwhile, has confirmed United have the right to recall striker Osman Sow from his loan at Kilmarnockneeded.“We are in good shape in that forward area and Osman is at that age where he wants to play games,” he added.“So that opportunity came up for him to go out on loan. We do have the option to recall himrequired.“But it will be good for him to go out and play.

That’s disappointing.“We have been working on them as a team but in both the first phase and second phase of set-plays we got it wrong and we couldn’t deal with it.“Against Inverness earlier in the season we did really well against a really high number of set-plays over the two games against them.“So I didn’t see it coming but it’s happened and we will be better at it.“We work on that every week, it’s built into our training. It’s something I loved working on as a player, others don’t, but it is something we will continue to work on.“Anybody looking at the game clearly could see nothing was won or lost down there, apart from our pride and three points.“I know Robbie will say the same. They set a marker and got a lot of pride.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d67969d72f2e7.89832614-e1567074280849.jpg ","title":"opening month of football has shown united are well ahead of dundee","story":"So what did Friday’s derby at Tannadice tell us and what have we learned from an eventful first month of the league season To take the most obvious first, it’s probably been that predictions this season’s promotion race in the second tier could well be a two-horse race may prove to be more than a little optimistic.Because, after only four games, the Tangerines look to be the only thoroughbreds in it and appear more than capable of streaking away from the rest of the field.Never mind the crushing - defeat of their city rivals and touted main contenders at the top of the table, all four of their outings so far have been mighty impressive.Two home games have seen them brush aside fancied opposition in the Dark Blues and Inverness with ease, scoring  and conceding just three goals.Just as he did when in charge at Hearts for the   campaign, boss Robbie Neilson has not just put together a very useful team, he’s got his timing spot on.Back then, the Jambos – facing a tougher challenge with both Rangers and Hibs in the ision – got off to a flying start by winning their first four outings.His current team have equalled that feat and will go one betterthey win down at Ayr in the middle of the month.Already they have the look of a team that’s going to be very hard for the rest to keep pace with and,September proves to be as good as August was, by the end of it automatic promotion will be theirs for the taking.Rightly, of course, Neilson has stressed there is a long way to go and challenges, possibly even tough times, will lie ahead.Privately, though, he has to be delighted with the start and feel the squad he’s assembled is capable of going the whole league season without suffering any more than one or two defeats.That’s not something any other manager in this ision will feel, simply because the other nine outfits all have the look of typical Championship sides – all capable of winning on any given day but also liable to lose a few.That’s certainly the case with Dundee, who’ve looked decent at times but showed on Friday they’re both inconsistent and fragile. Right now, boss James McPake must be scratching his head about that.Against Aberdeen in the Betfred Cup, his men came within a whisker of beating one of the country’s top teams.In the league, though, it’s been a dferent and worrying story. For  minutes in their opener they were in danger of being swamped by a Dunfermline side whose movement and pace they seemed to have no answer to, before rallying in the second half to earn a draw.If that first-half showing at East End Park was a warning future such lapses would prove costly, it was not heeded.After just over half-an-hour of the derby they were right in the game, maybe even a touch unlucky not to be ahead, but the loss of four goals in  minutes left them battered and badly bruised.With so many changes needed over summer, the early weeks of the season and even within games, that inconsistency was going to be a problem.However, Dundee were hammered by United and, given the quality of player they have, however new a team this is, it was an unacceptable outcome.It should also be said not many teams suffer the kind of beating the Dark Blues did against United and finish a season at the top of their league.Just one win from four games has to have Dee fans worried.Turning things round is going to take character.

Scott is obviously disappointed that he is not going to be playing in these qualiers as they are two great games.“It would have been two brilliant games for him to go into.“However, I think the good thing is that when Steve took the Scotland job on he played Scott in the first two games.“He sees Scott as part of that .”The hamstring tear suffered at Kilmarnock was the latest injury setback to marr McKenna’s international career.The centre-back suffered a hamstring tear against Rangers in the opening game of last season that ultimately ruled him out of action for six weeks.That injury saw him miss Scotland’s opening UEFA Nations League clash against Albania and the friendly with Belgium last September.McInnes believes the recent injury was particularly cruel for McKenna as he was in good form despite the speculation over his Aberdeen future.McKenna had submitted a transfer request days before the English transfer window closed on August  for Premier League and Championship clubs.Nottingham Forest and Queens Park Rangers both had bids for McKenna rejected before he handed in the request.Sheffield Wednesday came in with a late bid on transfer deadline day that was also rejected for the defender who is contracted to Pittodrie until .McInnes said: “Scott’s level of performance have been very strong. Unfortunately he missed spells of football last season with two hamstring injuries and this is another one.“This is a similar injury to when Scott over-stretched itagainst Rangers here making a blocking tackle.“He has over-stretched it again having lost his footing on that pitch and is out for the region of three to four weeks.“It may be a bit longer, maybe a bit shorter, but Scott has been a quick healer in the past.”Devlin’s call-up came  hours after histo the Dons starting line-up for the first time in six weeks after a hamstring injury.McInnes said: “It just shows you need that squad and how it changes because Mikey thought he was not getting into my team a couple of weeks ago.“Mikey is now in charge of he jersey and he comes back in now and plays.“We know we can rely on Mikey when he is called upon.“It is great to have that quality in the squad to call upon when you have injuries.McKenna is one of five centre-backs ruled out of Clarke’s Scotland squad with John Souttarand Stuart Findlayboth omitted with injuries.Grant Hanleyand Liam Palmerwere called up but dropped out with injuries.In reaction Clarke called up the Dons’ Devlin, , and Hamburg’s David Bates, on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.Uncapped Devlin was previously in the squad last November and was set to earn his first cap only to suffer an ankle injury training with Scotland that would rule him out for three months.McInnes said: “What looked like an innocuous injury when he was away with Scotland saw him miss the best part of three months.“He missed out on the League Cup final, playing for Scotland and a number of key games for us.“For a young lad he has a lot of injuries to deal with but hopefully he will have better times ahead.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d6004abb61e43.23715313.jpg ","title":"logan and campbell fitness boost dons","story":"Aberdeen have received a double fitness boost with right-back Shaleum Logan and midfielder Dean Campbell both set tofor the next Premiership clash.Logan missed the - defeat of Ross County prior to the international break having undergone a minor procedure on a groin injury.The defender is on course tofor the next clash against St Johnstone at Pittodrie next Saturday.Teenage midfielder Campbell has been sidelined since the - League Cup defeat of Dundee with a hip injury.Campbell had to withdraw due to injury from the Scotland Under- squad to face Japan in Pinatar, Spain, in two friendlies as preparation gets underway for UEFA European championship qualying in October.However, Campbell is also set to be fit to face the Perth Saints.Dons boss Derek McInnes said: “I think Shay will be all right for St Johnstone.“Under medical instruction he was advised not to play against Ross County.“Hopefully we can get him back in contact training in the week building up to St Johnstone.“Dean Campbell will hopefully be fit for St Johnstone.”Logan’s expectedwill be a timely boost for McInnes who had only four fit defenders for the clash with Ross County.Centre-backs Scott McKenna and Ash Taylor were also sidelined with hamstring tears.The manager said: “You could see on the benchthere were no midfielders and no defenders.

Savings will be identied following the implementation of the system to cover the ongoing costs.Discussions are currently taking place with senior officers within NHS Grampian to determine what level of financial support they can provide towards the project.Around , new children come into the service each year and the time-saving with the new digital system amounts to almost , hours per year for that cohort of children alone, or £, in terms of salary."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45127355-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45127355-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45127355-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45127355-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"run the benn event raises 4000 for charlie house","story":"A new race event has raised more than £, for a children’s charity.Run the Benn – an k trail race to Bennachie’s Mither Tap summit – raised the cash in support of Aberdeen-based charity Charlie House, which supports children and young people with complex disabilities and or le-limiting conditions.In total,  people registered to take part in the inaugural race.The event saw runners as young as six years old pulling on their running shoes to help to generate funds for Charlie House.Playing energetic music to keep runners motivated, a DJ was on hand near the top of Bennachie to see people off on their run back down.The event was organised by both Macdonald Pittodrie House Hotel and Juice Fitness  Lestyle.Susan Crighton, director of fundraising at Charlie House, thanked the organisers for selecting the charity as a beneficiary.She said: “We were delighted to be selected as one of the beneficiaries for the inaugural Run the Benn, alongside local charity BECS.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"get dancing get fit and have fun","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBack in April, the Mid Argyll branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society held a ‘Bring a Friend’ evening.The result was a super evening of dancing and laughter, not to mention some delicious home baking at half time, and the branch was delighted at the number of people who came along.Now the dancing season is starting again after the summer break and the members are hoping to welcome those friends – and others – to their regular Monday evening classes.Scottish Country Dancing is a really great way to stay physically and mentally fit while having a lot of fun and listening to some lovely music at the same time.

She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

Iain sensibly played short of the burn while Bruce had no option but to drive, splitting the fairway in the process leaving a  yard shot to the green. Iain#s second shot came up a bit short leaving him a dficult up and down, and the drama continued as Bruce almost holed his second shot to leave a tap in birdie. With nerves of steel, Iain chipped on to four feet and duly rolled in the putt for a well deserved victory of the Sam Andrews trophy.This was Iain#s first championship victory and in his acceptance speech he told the crowd of his delight at winning while complimenting the sterling work done on the course by Graham Prentice, John MacNab and Duncan Johnstone.Iain swept the boards, also winning the nett and senior championship at the same time. Captain Smyth also presented the John Reid Quaich to Duncan Johnstone, the James Johnson Cup to Iain Johnstone and the August medal to himself.Members were treated to a lovely buffet provided by Sheena, Georgie and Catherine, with celebrations carrying on late into the evening.Final totals: , Iain Macalister  , Bruce MacNab  , John MacNab ."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

The tragedy is I cannot tell my grandchildren the same because we messed up.ldquoBut so long as there are young people like those I met on Zomba Plateau about, we can have hope and faith in a future where all can share the bounty of this beautul creation.Afterwards, the youngsters moved on to the Liwonde Game Reserve where they helped restore no less than fourteen houses damaged in the severe floods of March.Then everyone got to experience a safari drive, many of whom for the first time, seeing elephants, hippos, warthogs, and lions up close.Also, a site visit was arranged to YONECO, one of the main sponsors of the camp, to learn of their special approach to promoting youth empowerment.To reinforce the talk the RYLA participants engaged with the women who live on the Plateau and men who make a living there passing on their newfound knowledge on how to minimise the effects of Climate Change.And handed out mango plants in small plastic sleeves that will provide a crop of fruit in three years.Nineteen-year-old leader, John Little said: ldquoThe pilot Malawi RYLA camp was a massive success. Over the week I saw impressive personal growth in the confidence and leadership of all participants, including myself.ldquoIrsquom proud of everyone involved as we delivered a yearsrsquo worth of

more importantly we know that great potential had been identied and developed and we had all made new friends for le.ldquoThe last day was an emotional experience with speeches, awards and a newly written RYLA rap song with backing choir!ldquoWe sang, we danced, we ate together, it was also enormous fun!ldquoMalawi is a breathtakingly beautul country and all the participants left the RYLA camp

Not only are volunteers providing fresh food for locals, they are also regenerating unused spaces, transforming them into lush green patches for all to feast upon. When filming wrapped, reporter Hilary Scott caught up with community gardeners Adam Skelton and Shirley Spence, to ask them how their gardens grow.THE High Street is the heart of the bustling town of Peebles.A derelict bit of land behind the former court building has been transformed into a tranquil greenspace and is now the Courthouse Community Garden.Adam Skelton told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoDuring the filming we discussed Borders Food Community Facebook Group which is a popular place for people to share food, plants, seeds, tools, and materials, as well as advice and information related to food growing, preparing, cooking and storing.ldquoAnyone can join the group free and there you can connect with lots of knowledgeable and very helpful grower, composters, cooks, preservers, picklers. The list goes on.ldquoWe also discussed land sharing. Various group members have allowed us to share their land and create group food gardens.And the Courthouse Community Garden is one of those havens.ldquoIt was an unused overgrown patch of land and we have converted it into a very productive little garden, explained Adam.ldquoThere is no contract or rent and we have not received any funding.The creation of this garden is down to the hard work of green-fingered volunteers and waste products, which Adam says is a ldquowin-win for all involved.He added: ldquoThe land owners get their land tended and access to free fresh food on their doorstep and we get to grow as we wish in this lovely space.Despite the success of Borders Food Community, Adam says he finds it odd that the vast majority of people are not eating truly local food when there are so many benefits.ldquoFor example therersquos the environment. There is no packaging or food miles, itrsquos so much tastier when fresh and all the nutrients intact and its better for local economy.Adam is very passionate about the work of community gardens and is encouraging locals to join Borders Food Community Facebook Group where they can discover their nearest community garden and get involved.The ITV crew headed to Innerleithen in the afternoon to discover a garden maintained by little and large green-fingers.Volunteers from community gardens across the Borders gathered at the Edible Garden along with St Ronanrsquos Primary School pupils.ldquoEveryone who wanted to got the chance to say a few words. It was great to have people from all the community gardens together in one place discussing more ways to collaborate together to further promote local food growing across the Borders, said Adam.The Edible Garden team were delighted to host the ITV Border Le crew.Shirley Spence said: ldquoWe enjoyed meeting the dferent groups of community growers and making new contacts. We were pleased with the comments and feedback about our garden and learning about other community gardens and their work in the Borders.And the children from St Ronanrsquos Primary School also

There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation. However, the march went off without any incident and there were no arrests, with only one warning which was drug related.A spit of rain earlier in the day failed to develop into poor weather as the marchers would round the town to hear speakers and listen to musicians at the rally at Kinloch Green.Mr Wilson said he was particuarly pleased at the turnout as there had been some confusion over whether the march would go ahead due to internal sions within the hierachcy of All Under One Banner, which has organised independence marches across the country.Following Mr Singh#s sacking, founder Neil Mackay resigned from his position on its national executive pending an internal investigation.Pro-UK Unionist group A Force For Good met the march on the shore front and say they filmed and counted the marchers, as they have at previous events, and afterwards claimed the turnout was just .Director, Alistair McConnachie, said: #All Under One Banner is basically the marching wing of the SNP. AUOB, and SNP MPs and MSPs, lie about the numbers which attend their marches, sometimes up to  or  times.#Unfortunately, they are not challenged by the Scottish media.

We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter childrens summer activities","story":"These activities, many of which have been provided free of charge, have been enjoyable and stimulating, not only for the youngsters but also the adults.We wish to express our sincere thanks to all those who gave their time and skills to delivering the activities.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year.

When the corn was eventually gathered in early September, it is said decaying corpses were discovered. They had lain in the fields since August , a day of barbaric infamy in Tranentrsquos history. The dead were victims of the Tranent Massacre, and one of the bodies may have been that of Jackie Crookston or Crookstone.I say lsquomayrsquo for there is ironically so little known about this well-known woman. A statue by David Annand of Jackie on Tranent High Street shows her beating her drum with a clenched fist, defiantly leading the protest against the Militia Act. The plaque by the statue calls her a ldquoresolute woman who joined the protest, and states she was one of those killed by the cavalry.Her heroic reputation is well established in local lore. The th-century historian John Martine called her ldquoa Tranent virago. This word describes a woman of brave, fearless qualities, but it has a sting in its tail. It can also be used to mean a woman who has overstepped her mark, broken cultural rules in relation to her role as defined by gender.And by leading the protest against the Militia Act she most certainly did this.Another th-century historian and collector of traditions, P. MrsquoNeill, was clear on her role: ldquoJackie indeed was the prime mover in the whole affair, he states.We have accounts of her beating her drum and leading the protest with chants of ldquonae militia. She is said to have threatened a captain of the cavalry and declared defiantly that ldquoshe didna care a pin though she were cut in halves, she wad hae nae militia. Another account has her telling a member of the yeomanry to leave or she would ldquothraw his neck, at which he duly rode off.If these accounts are true, she was indeed resolute on that day in defending her family, her neighbours and her community. Jackie was not the only woman on the streets that day, for women took a leading role in defending their families. But she was the most prominent, it seems.The Militia Act aimed to conscript young men into a militia by means of a ballot. It was resisted for a number of reasons, but for the poverty-stricken mining and farming communities of Tranent and the surrounding area, it was seen as an imposition which would take young men of working age away and potentially cripple their families economically.There is no space here to recount the details of the massacre, but much of what happened on that day remains hidden behind a mist of cover-up and official indference.And somewhere in the bloody carnage of August , , Jackie Crookston was killed, along with many others. Yet despite her leading role, her name was not included in the original list of people killed. Eleven deaths were recorded, but no mention of Jackie. ldquoHow her death escaped recording is dficult to explain, reflected P. MrsquoNeill in his book Tranent and its Surroundings.Perhaps an explanation can be found in an eyewitness account written immediately after the massacre. It was a letter from Archibald Roger to his we in Edinburgh.It begins: ldquoDear we, this comes to acquaint you that you need not weary for my ing home, for my sister is to be buried this afternoon at four orsquoclock, and I cannot come away till I see her decently interred. I am sorry to inform you of the cruelties that were committed here yesterday there were six persons shot dead on the spot, of which my sister was onehellip the number of wounded is not yet ascertained, but I am just now informed that  dead corpses were this morning found in the corn-fields and it is not known how many more may be found when the corn is cut.Was Jackie one of those lying undiscovered in a field  It seems so by some accounts. Is that why her death was not on the list  Sandy Mullay in his book The Tranent Massacre says she was shot in the streets, but there is also a tradition which states her body was found well away from Tranent much later in a field, with stab as well as gunshot wounds.Was she initially wounded and then a victim of later retribution  Was she hunted down in an unrecorded atrocity because of her role as ring leader, and a woman who didnrsquot know her place  She will have been easy to identy because of her prominence in the protest.Her death, just like her le, is unrecorded by history. Despite her leadership in the events, she was a woman and she was poor, and history lacks interest in such characters. A tax on the registration of births and deaths at this time meant many poor people lived and died unregistered even in parish records.So who was Jackie  We know she was born in Gladsmuir in June  and was a mother. Perhaps not all her children were registered because of the tax, but it seems she had at least four surviving at the time of the massacre. She was only  when she died, but how do we imagine her le  What was behind her passion in defending her community When I spoke of her to artist Mags Nisbet-Macfarlane, she was inspired to use art to search for the woman behind the historical glimpses.ldquoI felt connected to this woman I did not know, she told me, ldquoshe will have had a le that explains her defiance that day she had so little, but was protecting what was important to her.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery. For my son, an apple is a symbol of love. And my son loves the apples he eats, and the ones which walk with him.

In part, this could be because her fiction is risky, challenging, sometimes riotously funny, but as often sizzling with rage. Her titles include Man or Mango , Dot in the Universe, and Mimi, savage satires on gender politics which are nevertheless also filled with tenderness and optimism. Her fondness for emphasising words in capital letters or italics has irked some critics, who prefer the page to look ordered and calm. But since when was fiction a form of beta blocker  With Ellmann, you feel yoursquove had an injection of adrenaline, quickening your heartbeat and bringing the world alive.Compared with her other novels, Ducks, Newburyport takes something of a new turn. As always, a woman is at its heart, but in this instance, instead of a slim work, it is big: just shy of , pages. Told by an Ohio housewe, who bakes her way through the tale, it is a stream-of-consciousness portrait of modern-day America, in all its confusion, consumerism, and cupidity. A y glossary of abbreviations is appended, ranging from Ato ZPGby way of IHPand WMD . You get the picture.Theof the story is ambitious enough, but asshe needed something more to spur her on, Ellmann has written the entire book ndash barring the opening passage ndash in a single sentence. Does this sound intimidating  Probably. Or make the book hard to read  Not at all. It is like stumbling on an oasis in a desert, a refreshing, invigorating, restorative immersion in a piece of remarkable, thoughtful and truly innovative fiction. Too many headline-grabbing novels are dull and predictable, enervating rather than enjoyable, derivative when they should be daring. Such tedious stuff makes you forget that the original meaning of the word novel was something dferent, unique, and new.Thankfully the Booker  has recognised a work of exceptional talent. Its presence on the shortlist adds lustre to a prize that has been dogged over the years by accusations of mediocrity and popularism, charges that last yearrsquos winner, Milkman by Anna Burns, helped to refute. Ellmannrsquos fellow shortlistees are prestigious, including Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie, both of whom have won before, along with El Shafak, second only to Orhan Pamuk in Turkey for international acclaim, British writer Bernadine Eisto, and the Nigerian Chigozie Obioma, shortlisted for his second novel, as he was with his first.The competition is stf, but already statistics are being trotted out: were it to win, Ducks, Newburyport would be the longest to prevail in the historyrsquos prize, beating even Eleanor Cattonrsquos doorstopper, The Luminaries, by more than  pages. Apart from their size, however, these two novels are poles apart. There is nothing conventional about Ducks, Newburyport. Indeed, Ellmannrsquos literary credentials can be traced back to James Joyce, the exemplar of stream of consciousness, where the reader has to surrender themselves to the flow, trusting the author to keep their head above water until they reach their destination. In the fluidity of Ellmannrsquos prose therersquos an echo of Henry James, with his sharp and self-conscious interrogation of America. Therersquos a nod to Virginia Woolf too, but Ellmannrsquos wit and acerbity, her scorching political lens, are all her own.The direction her style has taken is perhaps no surprise. Ellmannrsquos late father Richard was a world-renowned expert on Oscar Wilde and Yeats, but above all on James Joyce. His biography of the myopic Dublin genius has never been surpassed, remaining one of the most acclaimed literary biographies of the last century. The linguistic poetry and emotional range of Joyce, who must have been an invisible but constant presence in the Ellmann household, seems to have got under his daughterrsquos skin at a formative age.The announcement of the Booker Prize next month, on October , will mark  years to the day since its only Scottish winner, James Kelman, took the prize in  with How Late It Was, How Late. This was a highly contentious choice, not just because of its interior monologue narration, but also its liberal use of the F-word, which horried one uptight judge. The controversy it sparked has never been forgotten. These days, though, you canrsquot help thinking the title sounds like a lament for the lapse of time between Kelmanrsquos success and that of anyone  living north of the Border.There is no doubting Kelmanrsquos status as one of our finest novelists. Along with Alasdair Gray, he is an obvious contender for a Nobel Prize, though the chances of that idiosyncratic telescopersquos lens turning in this direction seem slim. Unlike many others, winning the Booker did not make Kelman rich or famous. It did, however, raise his profile internationally, and set a benchmark for those keen to add something memorable to the literary cairn.Ducks, Newburyport certainly does that. Other than in their tireless search for a mesmerising and distinctive way of expressing themselves, at first glance there is little obvious common ground between this pair. It is only when you read their books and recognise their seemingly effortless brilliance that you realise how similar, and rare, they are.In the acknowledgements at the end of Ducks, Newburyport, Ellmann thanks ldquoEdinburgh City Council for my Saltire card, a dandy aid to the impecunious. Itrsquos a cheerful reminder that unless yoursquore a bestseller, the literary le is not deluxe. Yet listening to the naturalness of her narratorrsquos voice, and the stories she tells, makes you grateful that the writerrsquos feet are firmly on the ground, be it a New Town pavement, No.  bus, or mid-west America, where the future is unfolding fast."},{"url":null,"title":"pro-remain-electoral-pact-needed-stop-hard-brexit","story":"Hemmed in by hostile opponents in a Scottish Government debate opposing Boris Johnsonrsquos no-deal Brexit shenanigans, the blows rained down on them.

A Johnson win would undo all the unprecedented cross-party effort that has gone into trying to block a no-deal Brexit.The timing of an election has been much discussed, with Opposition parties more or less agreeing that they cannot allow a poll to take place before Boris Johnson has been forced to delay Brexit.But even , prior to the election, Mr Johnson had bowed to the demands of the Extension Bill and asked Brussels for a delay to Brexit , once elected he would most likely steer the country towards no-deal at the end of January instead of October.Of course he might be able to use those three months to negotiate a deal with the EU, but in spite of the Government spin suggesting that a deal is imminent, therersquos been precious little progress so far. Like a lazy child who insists hersquos nearly finished his homework when it lies untouched in his schoolbag, Mr Johnson has come up with nothing concrete yet to replace the Irish backstop, according to the EU, which is still waiting.So what can be done to prevent a hard Brexit  Mr Johnson must be kept out of Downing Street ndash which means Opposition parties forming an electoral pact.:Ian McConnell: No escape from Johnsonrsquos dire Brexit farce in Paris metro and airportNow, Irsquom not saying this will be easy. How, one wonders, do you sit down over tea and biscuits with a bunch of folk yoursquove been loudly slagging off for years  Is it like a school mediation session Perhaps they all have to write down something nice about each other and read it out loud.Itrsquos not easy for politicians of opposing parties to work together, but theyrsquove done it over the Extension Bill, and now they need to do it with the election. The latest poll shows Labour on  per cent, the Lib Dems on  per cent and the Greens on five per cent, UK-wide. Add in a strong showing for the SNP and Plaid Cymru, and an anti-no deal majority is possible ndash but onlythe pro-Remain parties are prepared to work in concert.They did it in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, where the Greens and Plaid Cymru graciously stood aside to help the frontrunner Lib Dems win. Now the Lib Dems, Labour and the SNP must consider similar action.What are the other options  Try to force through a referendum bill  There wasnrsquot enough support for adding a referendum provision to the Extension Bill, so that looks unlikely. Get the Extension Bill through, then hold a no-confidence vote in Mr Johnson in order to create a government of national unity to seek a new deal on dferent terms which could then be put to a referendum  This is an appealing prospect andpoliticians were characters in a childrenrsquos TV drama, then we could trust them to come together like this ldquoin the national interest , but again, it would require trust across tribal lines and a willingness to suffer the brickbats such an arrangement would inevitably trigger. Jo Swinson has said Jeremy Corbyn could not lead such a government, since few Tories would back him, and she may be right, but thatrsquos not to say a compromise candidate couldnrsquot be found.An election, however, remains the most obvious way out of the impasse, so the Opposition parties must be ready.It has felt at times in the past few days asthe plot of a Simon Pegg movie is unfolding at Westminster, one where a crazy sect of androids has taken over the government and is ejecting respectable Tory pensioners onto College Green in the rain, dropping the torn fragments of their Conservative Party membership cards at their feet. The fightback is surely imminent: Irsquom sure wersquod all like to see what Nicholas Soames can do with the parliamentary mace.But in the absence of a septuagenarian revolt, wersquoll have an election to try and put right this mess. An anti-no-deal electoral pact will be essential, becausethere isnrsquot one, all of this may well have been for nothing."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee-39-s-80m-museum-quot-boring-quot-little-quot-cafe-quot-say-experts","story":"Architects have dismissed VA Dundee as a ldquocafeteria, expressed concerns about its ldquohanging concrete elements and claimed the money had bought a lot of ldquofresh air.However, a spokesman for the museum defended the facility, arguing that it had been ldquodesigned to be a living room for the city and to promote debate about design.The cost of the project had been estimated at poundm, but overruns led to a final bill of nearly twice that amount.An imposing building based by the city waterfront, and designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, it opened in September last year after delays.

Our reporters have set the national news agenda week after week on topics including health, politics, environment, land use and justice.We even managed to secure the prestigious title of Newspaper of the Year at the Regional Press Awards in May ndash an achievement almost unheard of for a paper just a few months old.Along with ground-breaking exclusives on the scandals affecting both Glasgowrsquos flagship super hospital and Edinburghrsquos new Sick Kidsrsquo, we have successfully campaigned for nitrite-containing meats to be banned from schools and hospitals, revealed that Glasgow would have to sell off many of its prized properties to cover its staggering equal pay bill and exposed the politicians using controversial gagging clauses to silence staff.We have not only reported issues affecting the central belt, with our launch edition focusing on the crisis of a crumbling ferry fleet what was putting island communities and tourism at risk. We have followed the problems with community buy-out schemes, and highlighted the concerns among members of the fishing industry in rural areas.Our political coverage of the Brexit chaos of the last year, as well as Labours anti-Semitism problems and the ferocious debate around gender recognition reforms has regularly sparked public discussion and set the agenda for the weeks ahead.Editor-in-Chief Donald Martin said: \"For a paper so young, it has been wonderful to watch The Herald on Sunday achieve such great things.\"The publication has become a worthy addition to the Herald brand, and has allowed us to achieve our goal of giving our readers the best insight, analysis and opinion, without agenda or bias, seven days a week.\"I would like to thank the team who produce such great work every week, but I would also like to thank our loyal readers for helping us to create such a strong seven-day brand, both in print and online.\"Here are a few of the stories wersquove broken in our first year.HOSPITALS SCANDALSince a -year-old boy died following an outbreak of Cryptococcus linked to bird droppings at Glasgowrsquos Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in December, the Herald on Sunday has been at the forefront of investigating the problems at the scandal-hit hospital. Since the turn of the year, we have revealed internal documents showing the concerns raise by employees as far back as , the poundm neurological theatres lying empty after failing safety tests and the concerns by senior sources that the design focussed more on innovation than patient care and safety. The Scottish Government has since launched in inquiry into the problems at the hospital, and the Health and Safety Executive is currently investigating.Similarly, this newspaperrsquos coverage of problems at Edinburghrsquos Sick Kidsrsquo hospital started long before the delays to the facility opening were announced by health minister Jeane Freeman in July.In October  we revealed NHS Lothian chiefs considering taking the firm constructing the hospital to court to resolve issues around ventilation but decided against it and paid them to complete the work instead. Following Freemanrsquos announcement on another delay, we reported a senior trade unionistrsquos concerns that the facility may have be demolished and rebuilt, followed by further revelations by the health secretary that a further two yearsrsquo worth of work may be needed before it can finally open.POLITICSOn the day the UK was set to leave the European Union, and with Parliament in chaos, this newspaper produced a striking front cover demanding that MPs Choose Something after numerous failed votes on Theresa Mays Brexit deal. We revealed Boris Johnsons true views on Scotland ahead of his selection as Prime Minister, and that the probe into allegations against Alex Salmond covered the period during the Independence Referendum. When Labour began facing claims over anti-Semitism, this newspaper told how Jews in Scotland were considering leaving. We later detailed how senior party member sand Jewish leaders in Scotland felt Scottish Labour was unable to handle anti-Semitism within its ranks, due to complaints being jandled by London HQ.When former MP Natalie McGarry was convicted of embezzlement, the woman who blew the whistle came forward to speak to us about why and how she had made the decision to report her suspicions of wrongdoing. Another whistleblower, who revealed conversations between several MSPs stating Nicola Sturgeon was \"out of step\" with her party on gender reform plans, also told us about her decision to do so.One former employee of Joanna Cherry MP also came forward to share her experiences of working with the politician and her office manager Fraser Thompson, who were facing a probe into alleged bullying by the House of Commons officials. We were the only newspaper to reveal the nature of the complaints against the pair, which were later dismissed by investigators as not constituting bullying.Three senior SNP figures started a national conversation over online trolling and so-called cybernats, and their role in the Independence debate. Angus Robertson, Stewart McDonald MP and Alyn Smith MEP came forward to denounce online abuse, which featured in a front-page exclusive in May.NITRITESThe Herald on Sunday launched a ground-breaking campaign in March to help rid school meals and hospital food of chemicals linked to bowel cancer.Scientists placed processed meat containing nitrites in the same carcinogenic category as tobacco and asbestos, the danger comes when food preservatives such as nitrites are heated.Our initial story in February revealed that a majority of hospitals and councils, which are responsible for school meals, offered children nitrite-containing meat.The revelation led to our campaign, which urged the Scottish Government to ensure that nitro-meat was removed from schools and hospitals. Education Secretary John Swinney responded weeks later when a statutory limit was placed on processed meat intake for the first time.DIRTY WARIn April we reported a major step forward in one of the Heraldrsquos longest running investigations: the role of Scottish spymaster Gordon Kerr in the Dirty War in Northern Ireland.High-level security sources said that Kerr, the Scottish army officer who headed up the notorious military intelligence Force Research Unit, in Ulster, was to be questioned under caution by police investigating collusion, murder, kidnap and torture in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.The most infamous double-agent working for the FRU was Stakekne, who was named by the Herald newspapers as Freddie Scappaticci in .ABUSES OF POWERWith more of the population diagnosed with dementia, the use of Power of Attorney, which gives another person the ability to make decisions on behalf of someone who is deemed no longer capable, is on the rise. With that comes fear of abuse of the powers.In March we ran a story about Steven Fitzpatrick, who, with other members of his family, was being prevented from seeing his father. Steven had not been able to visit his father, Walter, for the best part of three years.The story revealed flaws in a system which is set to be used by increasing numbers of people. Since we ran the story, Fitzpatrick has been allowed to see his father, though he is still campaigning for change.CLIMATE CHANGEFrom the moment Swedish climate striker Greta Thunbergrsquos speech before the United Nations went viral, we began following Scottish children campaigning for change here. These young people - whether Holly Gillibrand,, from Fort William, Ruby, , from Perthshire, who, with her six-year-old brother, was the first climate striker to sit outside the Scottish Parliament ndash from the start revealed themselves to be highly informed.Some went on to meet with Nicola Sturgeon and put their case to her.

After all, Argyll is not part of the climate problem, it is part of the solution. That is because, according to the most recent figures published, for , the areas forests and bogs take nearly as much CO out of the atmosphere as its people put in.Indeed, some climate policy makers think Argyll and even Highland ndash home to some of Europes great peatlands, effectively globally signicant carbon sinks ndash might already be scoring carbon negative, though the figures are not quite there to prove that. They may already be global coolers.Argyll and Bute is close to zero net carbon, the aspiration for Scotland as a whole and big cities in particular. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants to get to \"zero\" by . That does not mean the country ndash a relatively important regional producer of oil and gas ndash will not use any fossil fuels. \"Net zero\" means that the whole country, rather like Argyll now, sucks up as much carbon as it belches out.Glasgow and Edinburgh have both announced a race to get to net zero first among UK cities ndash but they realise they cannot compete with wilderness areas in the Highlands.\"We dont have any wooded mountains to offset our emissions,\" joked one Clydeside policy-maker. \"We are going to have to cut carbon the hard way.\"Today, as local and national authorities mull some of the tough and le-changing decisions needed to wean us all off fossil fuels, The Herald on Sunday maps Scotlands net carbon output, broken down per capita.Policy wonks already know where the our carbon comes from, but for many Scots, the raw numbers may come as a surprise, perhaps because plotting CO emissions by local authority also tells us a story of lost industrial might and shting economic activity and population from west to east.Gone, of course, are the great factories and forges of Glasgow. Three or four decades after de-industrialisation, Scotlands biggest city, with its low car ownership and relatively good public transport, now generates less than half as much CO per capital as oil-rich, fuel-guzzling Shetland or suburban East Lothian. So too does the Clyde Valleys once industrial hinterlands of Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire.Edinburgh and Dundee also score less than the Scottish average of . tonnes of CO per capita per year. The number for Argyll, as of , is . tonnes. That does not mean Argyllers are eco-friendly far from it, as we shall see later.So where are Scotlands hotspots for carbon  Well, in the middle and east of the countrys central belt. Fe, which has some of the great volume whisky makers, generates more CO than Glasgow overall and ranks seventh in a per-capita league table.Falkirk Council, home of the giant Grangemouth petrochemicals and refining complex, is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the worst offender for global heating when emissions are ided per person. It produces nearly  tonnes of Co for every man, woman and child. Local officials are philosophical. Falkirk is not even in the running to get to zero net carbon, not while it is cracking crude.That does not mean that Falkirk is not improving. It is, and faster than the national average. But it does mean Scotland in the future will always need areas, like the Highlands and their peat bogs, that are increasingly carbon negative. Already, the trees and peatlands of the Highlands extract more CO from the atmosphere than large installations in Falkirk add.Where does Scotland overall stand on CO emissions  Middling, by European Union standards. And middling by UK standards. The country has one of Europes best records on renewable electricity but one of the worst on domestic heating. We remain addicted to gas boilers, though not for much longer,the Scottish Government gets it way.The gradual switch to renewable electricity has, however, had an impact. Scotland and England both recorded a % reduction in greenhouse carbon emissions between  and . The North-East of England has gone greener faster. Its emissions fell % in  years. The bad news  That was partly due to industrial closures. Scotlands total output of CO, less those carbon sinks, is m tonnes. .But of the net emissions that we can attribute directly to British nations and regions, Scotlands net per capita of . tonnes of CO looks distinctly average, around the same as East Anglia or North-West England. Britains worst carbon creator is Wales, home to remaining heavy industries, with a per-capita average of .. The least polluting is London, due, according to the UK Governments Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy, \"to the urban nature of the transport system, a high population density and its lower level of large industrial facilities than other regions\". The average Londoner generates . tonnes of CO.China, of course, remains the biggest greenhouse gas producer. But not per capita, which is as low as  tonnes, about the same as Northern Ireland.For comparison, the United States and Canada both generate  tonnes of CO per resident, as of . These are entire countries whose average is slightly higher than Scotlands most polluting region, Falkirk, though as of . Roughly speaking, Scotland is doing a better than Germany, Russia and Japan, about the same as Italy and Denmark and a little worse than France and Sweden, according to ious databases.Glasgow, though no longer the biggest contributor of Scottish local governments, already has a blueprint, published by its \"Climate Emergency Working Group\". It has announced eye-catching suggestions, such as plastic-free school dining and ambitious aspirations to recreate a municipally owned bus company.Everybody knows that further progress now depends on switching from gas central heating and fossil-fuel power in transport and industry. ScottishPower, which is supporting the citys Zero-Net Carbon initiative, says it reckons that means quadrupling output of renewable electricity.In Argyll and Bute per-capita consumption of fossil fuels for transport is higher than in Glasgow ndash after all the huge stretched out local authority has far less public transit than the big city.A spokesman for Scotlandsaccidentally greenest council had plenty to praise.ldquoWe have a number of renewables initiatives aimed at reducing carbon emissions in Argyll and Bute, such as Glengorm landfill sitersquos wind turbine which creates energy to run the operation on Mull while feeding power back into the grid,\" he said. \"We are also replacing more than , illuminated signs and streetlights with LED lighting, and there is a rolling programme of energy improvements at council buildings.\"Then he added: \"The arearsquos vast amount of greenery helps to offset carbon emissions.HIGHLANDS AND ARGYLLScotlandrsquos big cities may have announced a race to be the first to reach zero net carbon. But it is a race they have already lost. The forests and peatlands of Argyll and Bute and Highland Council are almost removing more carbon from our atmosphere than the people of the two local authorities are putting in. And that is for , the most recent figures available. They could already be in negative territory, making them net contributors to cleaning the planet. That does not mean that residents lead a particularly green lestyle. Argyll, for example, has far higher per-capita emissions for transport than Glasgow.FALKIRKNowhere in Scotland does anything like as much damage to the planet as Falkirk, at least on a per capita. The relatively small local authority, after all, is home to the giant petrochemical complex at Grangemouth. The area, in fact, generates more climate-changing CO than the whole of Edinburgh despite having just a third of the capitalrsquos population. However, Falkirk is making progress at much the same pace as the rest of the country, with its emissions per capita down from above  tonnes per person in  to just under  in .THE ISLANDSFor many, Scotlandrsquos northern and western isles are a green idyll. Far from it. Shetland has the fourth highest level of per-capita emissions in Scotland with figures of more than  tonnes per person, nearly double the Scottish national average. while Orkney and Eilean Siar do little better with . per person. All three archipelagos have high levels of heating and transport costs and even industry. Shetland, home of the Sullom Voe oil terminal, more than twice as much in industrial Co output as Glasgow per person. Shetlandrsquos transport contributions to global warming are rising toohellip.and are half as much again as GlasgowrsquosEAST LOTHIANEdinburghrsquos eastern commuter belt might not look like an engine for climate change. But with twice the per-capita output of Scotlandrsquos cities that is what it is. The local authority has high levels of Co generation from industry, transport and domestic dwellings, as of , and has made less progress than many areas in reducing its greenhouse gases.GLASGOWOnce the industrial second city of the empire, Glasgow is now aiming to be a clean green place. Itrsquos Scotlandrsquos biggest council, but not the one that produces the most Co. That honour goes to Fe.

The damage he has done to this country in a few short weeks cannot be allowed to continue unchecked. Even his own brother recognised that the grip the elder Johnson has on reality is slipping further as each day goes by. Jo Johnson resigned his Ministerial role and ruled out standing at the next general election, stating he was putting the national interest ahead of family loyalty.It is clear that a general election is needed. Boris Johnsonrsquos abandonment of Conservative and Unionism and his adoption of a very dangerous strain of English nationalism is such a signicant breach from his predecessor that it amounts to a political  with no mandate.

Boris Johnsonrsquos recent actions have shown he cannot be trusted with democracy and that he has no respect for parliamentary process.The only tenable option is to delay agreeing to a general election until the threat of a no-deal exit from the EU is off the table ndash guaranteed ndash and until the provision for an extension to the negotiating timetable has been entrenched.I believe that a general election will happen over the next few months, and it is clear that it is only Labour who can form an alternative government.Moreover in Scotland, we can stop the dual damage that Tory and SNP austerity has had on our communities and instead elect a government focused on the issues that people care most about ndash jobs, properly ing public services, with direct interventions to tackle poverty and rising inequality, dignity in older age and action on the climate emergency ndash rather than a government which is intent on constitutional chaos with a no-deal Brexit.A vote for Labour will also show the SNP that another independence referendum is just not wanted.And so, as we head into a new week, expect more political drama. In this drama, the job of the Labour Party will be to work hard to hold the disastrous Tories to account and in so doing pave the way for their removal from office at the earliest opportunity.We will also show that there is a clear and radical alternative, leading to a better future and that the Labour Party is the only vehicle for the realisation of it."},{"url":null,"title":"kirsty-blaclman-brexit-comment-scotland-must-choice-better-future","story":"Throughout the Brexit process Scotland has been completely ignored by Westminster ndash and our interests have been sidelined.

The Scots anchor mentioned that almost every time Mr McDonnell had been on the show he had called for a General Election, but not now. ldquoSometimes you do have to put your country before party, was the rather self-satisfied answer.McDonnell had one more task: not to fall into the same trap that his colleague Emily Thornberry had wandered into on Question Time when she said that she would negotiate an exit from the EU then, in a future referendum, campaign to Remain. McDonnell said essentially the same but in the quiet of a Sunday morning, away from the QT boxing ring, and with references to the way Harold Wilson had allowed his Cabinet to campaign on both sides in the  referendum, Mr McDonnell seemed the soul of reason.: Iain Macwhirters viewHe was not budging, however, on it being ABJ ndash Anyone But Jeremy ndash as PM in the event of a caretaker government, despite what LibDem leader Jo Swinson had said on not working with the Labour leader.

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

Only then can you appreciate the true scale of the towering structures – in this case as tall as London’s BT Tower or three Scott Monuments stacked on top of each other.But what was probably most surprising for me on my visit to Aberdeen Bay was the relative lack of noise. I had expected to hear a giant, rhythmic whomping sound and feel the turbulence as the rotors with a diameter of  metres chewed the air. It was all remarkably silent, save for the sea breeze, and strangely peaceful, hypnotic even.The way things are moving such developments could soon become almost as familiar a sight as their land-based counterparts. Offshore wind is the next big thing for the UK, particularly Scotland. Not only does it produce renewable electricity, helping the country achieve its climate targets, it is opening up a whole new industry – and perhaps offering a kiss of le to one that has been anticipating the last rites.With more than , miles of mainland coastline, Scotland has a lot of sea. And our much-cursed climate means we’ve also got plenty of wind. Globally the North Sea is considered one of the best places to build offshore wind farms because of its relatively shallow water and high wind speeds.Scotland also has something  that gives us an advantage in the bid to build a thriving offshore wind sector –  years of expertise in undersea engineering, thanks to our oil and gas heritage. Add to that the country’s experience in onshore wind, which has been growing steadily and has matured over the past couple of decades.All this together means Scotland can move swtly to take advantage of its offshore potential.What’s so good about offshore wind Offshore wind farms have the same green credentials as land-based turbines – they create renewable energy, do not consume water, do not emit environmental pollutants or greenhouse gases, while also providing a domestic energy source and creating jobs. Key advantages lie in the fact that offshore wind speeds tend to be faster and more consistent than on land, reducing energy intermittency associated with onshore turbines. Also being further away from human habitation means reduced visual impact and disturbance to local residents.So where are we at Scotland currently has five operational offshore wind farms, mainly pilot schemes – including the world’s first floating offshore site – together amounting to more than  megawatts of installed capacity. Scotland’s largest site, the Beatrice scheme, located off the Caithness coast, became fully operational this summer. With  turbines, it can generate a massive  megawatts of electricity – enough for , homes – and provides more than half of all the offshore wind generated in the UK.There are a number of others in development, including four giant commercial projects in the Forth and Tay – MW Neart na Gaoithe, MW Inch Cape and ,MW Seagreen Alpha and Bravo, with up to  turbines between them.The offshore wind sector is considered a UK success story, with the largest installed capacity in the world to date. Its contribution to annual generation increased from . per cent in  to . per cent in , and is expected to reach around  per cent by . More than , people are already directly employed in the sector nationwide, and this is likely to increase.So strong is the confidence in offshore wind, which has seen costs fall faster than anyone could have foreseen a decade ago, that Westminster has agreed a sector deal as part of the UK’s Industrial Strategy. This commitment aims to see offshore wind contributing up to  gigawatts of generating capacity by . Eight UK “clusters” have been formed under the sector deal, with two in Scotland – DeepWind, which covers northern and western Scotland, and Forth  Tay Offshore. The clusters are partnerships of industry, academia and the public sector, with the aim of developing a new offshore wind supply chain.The Offshore Renewable EnergyCatapult, a technology innovation and research centre for offshore wind, wave and tidal energy, has been set up to support the emerging sector.ORE Catapult’s Andrew Macdonald said: “Offshore wind is absolutely key to the future low-carbon economy. It’s a big opportunity for the North Sea and our job is to identy the challenges and help innovators through to market.”What’s coming next Crown Estate Scotland, which manages leasing of the seabed out to  nautical miles and holds the rights to offshore renewable energy and carbon and gas storage out to  nautical miles from the coast, is poised to open up a new leasing round this autumn.Potential sites are being outlined by Marine Scotland, but it’s likely there will be increased opportunity in deeper waters further offshore, reflecting advances in technology. It marks the first major leasing round for commercial-scale offshore wind developments in Scotland. John Roberston, head of energy and infrastructure for Crown Estate Scotland, says the resulting contracts will allow developers certainty and better visibility for the future. He says there is recognition that the industry is maturing and the leases will help build an “efficient, long-term sustainable industry”. So what’s not to like Donald Trump, whose Balmedie golf resort looks out at the Aberdeen Bay wind farm, warned the development would be a “monstrous” blight on the horizon. “I want to see the ocean. I do not want to see windmills,” he fumed. Then in , after formal construction plans were submitted, the future president filed a complaint to the Scottish Government, bemoaning “the horrible idea of building ugly wind turbines directly off Aberdeen’s beautul coastline”. The courts ruled against him.But Trump is not the only one who has concerns over offshore wind. The RSPB, which is generally supportive of renewable energy, challenged plans to build four giant offshore schemes in the Forth and Tay. The conservation charity claimed thousands of protected seabirds would be at risk of death or displacementthe -odd turbines were erected, which could threaten the survival of species already in decline. After a protracted legal battle judges found in favour of Scottish ministers and the projects are set to go ahead.“Offshore wind has great potential for vast quantities of generation, specically in Scottish waters,” said Charlie Nathan, senior conservation planner at RSPB Scotland. “But it comes with quite a considerable risk to marine wildle, particularly seabirds, so we’re very keen for any action taken to combat climate change not to create any adverse effect or new environmental problem on bioersity grounds. The projects we’ve seen come forward in Scotland have come with quite thorny issues around the scale of risk to internationally protected seabird populations up and down the east coast of Scotland.”He believes there is a “legal and moral obligation” to look after Scotland’s world-renowned seabird heritage. “Studies point to very substantial impacts. Obviously we disagree with the decision around whether those levels of impacts are acceptable or not. What we’re seeing now is projects going ahead, even though it’s there in black and white the scale of impacts, with thousands of birds being killed annually or dying because they are being displaced from their foraging grounds.“It gets even worsethere are several developments. Looking to the future, with vast amounts of offshore wind, there could be a situation where birds are no longer able to get to a lot of the best areas for feeding.”Some of the key risks for other wildle come around the construction phase. The impact of noise from piling for turbine foundations is known to displace marine mammals such as porpoises, dolphins and seals. There is also a potential risk to migratory species from underwater cabling, which gives off an electromagnetic field that could possibly disrupt their navigational abilities.Conservationists are calling for some kind of offsetting scheme, that would require developers to invest in beneficial environmental projects to compensate for negative impacts.Offshore wind could also spell bad news for fisheries, through both destruction of habitat and direct displacement of fishing fleets around offshore installations and undersea infrastructure. Fishermen are concerned their needs are being ignored as the industry takes off. Malcolm Morrison, fisheries policy officer for the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, said: “The fishing industry is not against offshore renewables per se, but we are focused on protecting our interests. We feel strongly that unlike when the oil and gas industry arrived in the North Sea in the early s, the level of engagement with our sector from the renewables industry and from planners involved in assessing many of these projects has been unsatisfactory, and we want this to improve.”He complains that plans have been published without any feedback sought from fishermen, then developers have shown unwillingness to make changes that would avoid problems. “Given the intense competition for space at sea, this could severely restrict fishing opportunities in the future,” he said.The SFF believes wind farm owners should offer compensation payments for displacing vessels using mobile fishing gear, as has been done for some creelers. He added: “Proper, ongoing engagement with the fishing industry by all involved in the renewables planning process, coupled with the introduction of enforceable licence conditions which protect and recognise the importance of the fishing industry as a food producer, are necessary.” How do we reduce the risks The .MW Aberdeen Bay scheme – or to give it its official title, the European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre– has been up and running for a full year. It currently hosts the world’s most powerful wind turbines, generating the equivalent of  per cent of Aberdeen’s domestic electricity demand – enough to supply , homes each year. It was constructed using specially designed suction bucket foundations that require no piling to install, massively reducing noise pollution that can disrupt marine creatures. It is also running a pioneering £. million scientic research programme to assess the environmental impacts of offshore wind, with in-depth scientic research and monitoring in a real-time environment.Jesper Kyed Larsen, environmental expert for Vattenfall, which owns the EOWDC, said: “We are trying to better understand what is the actual impact of offshore wind farms on wildle and the environment. Currently there is a lot of uncertainty when we are doing impact assessments for new projects over what the effects are on particular species or habitats.“I’m leading an environmental research programme where we can proactively improve the evidence base for offshore wind projects and mitigation of impacts. We get together with other people from the industry, with regulators, environmental experts, NGOs and academia to identy the key knowledge gaps, where we can bring down this uncertainty, then we can have more realistic assessments and decisions on wind farms, including mitigation that can be adopted to manage impacts. We’re trying to take an active role in getting us there so we are not getting stuck in discussions about potential impacts that may be not real in the end.“Animals don’t respect borders. It’s a big challenge to get international-level projects up and running. But as an industry we are at the scale of the North Sea so it’s really happening and it’s the way we need to move forward.”So what might the future of offshore wind look like There are numerous intriguing innovations coming forward and many more still at the concept stage. Scotland is already making headlines in this department – the Hywind project, off Caithness, is the world’s first fully operational floating wind farm.Coming soon to the UK for testing are supercharged turbines with a rotor diameter of m and output of  megawatts, to be installed at the ORE Catapult site in Northumberland. There are also proposals for vertical axis turbines and multi-turbine arrangements on a single pillar.Vattenfall’s Kevin Jones, who oversees the EOWDC, is enthusiastic about the pioneering work his team is involved in. The scheme uses remote-controlled submarines for underwater maintenance and drones that are programmed to carry out aerial surveys of rotors and other hardware. Maintenance-free bolts, guaranteed to stay tight for  years, have been fitted to the turbines. A local thunderstorm warning system has been installed, as well as an erosion-safe mode for blades and online cable monitoring. Plans are also being developed to build articial reefs around turbine bases, both to restore the underwater habitat and protect foundations and cabling from the effects of the sea. Across the industry there is also an increasing interest in multipurpose schemes, with a wide range of possible combinations. Andy McDonald is head of low carbon at Scottish Enterprise, which is involved with the clusters. He is confident that a move towards deep-water technology, such as floating turbines, could open up global opportunities for Scotland since many countries have very little shallow areas off their coasts. He also points to new collaborations that might once have seemed unthinkable, as a growing number of petroleum giants move into renewables.“It’s a logical progression for the oil and gas industry,” he said. “The energy sector is transitioning and they are already looking at what their role will be. They have a great deal of expertise in offshore energy and undersea engineering and a huge amount of infrastructure in the North Sea, so there are a number of things they can bring to the table in the transition to low-carbon and renewables. The industry has  years of experience of work in a very challenging environment.”McDonald says there is currently a lot of discussion over potential repurposing of drilling s and subsea cabling, much of which is due for decommissioning in the near future, for use in the renewables sector. “It’s a huge economic opportunity for Scotland,” he said. Offshore wind farms could also soon be used to power oil and gas s to remove the need for diesel generators and cut their carbon emissions. Other ideas include integration of offshore wind with floating solar farms, wave energy devices or even shellfish farms. “It’s something we’re looking into with interest,” said Vattenfall’s Jesper Kyed Larsen. “It has been an ongoing discussion for many years, whether there could be co-use of offshore wind farms. Unfortunately it’s not as simple as it may sound in terms of operating the wind farms and being able to have the kind of vessels we need and unhindered access, but we are investigating and trying to get ahead of any opportunity it could present for specic projects.”All this and more is set to be discussed by the industry’s top players at the  Floating Offshore Wind conference and exhibition, which is being held in Aberdeen on  October©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm winning the only aim of brexit loser boris","story":"Brexiteers may claim they value sovereignty but events of the past week confirm that all they really care about is victory, writes Euan McColmIt’s no longer about Brexit. I wonderit ever really was.The departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union – the seemingly interminable problem that’s felled two prime ministers and exposed a third as a fool – may be at the heart of the crisis that engulfs our politics, but the prize means nothing when compared with the triumph. Winning, at any cost, is everything.Boris Johnson may have led the Leave campaign in  promising that Brexit would be a cinch, that the EU would wave off the UK after meeting any and all of our demands, but now, having achieved his prime objective of becoming Prime Minister, he is bogged down in the swamp of his lies. He and his lieutenants are now desperate.The past week has, from one perspective, been glorious. Those who have long believed Johnson to be a selfish charlatan, a man for whom the achievement of high office has always and only ever been about the satisfaction of his ego, would have found it dficult not to enjoy the sight of reality smacking him in the chops.To watch the Prime Minister lose vote after vote – on Brexit and the matter of a general election – was quite the spectacle.But any pleasure to be taken from Johnson’s misfortune is tempered by the absolute misery of the situation into which he has dragged the UK.Back in , then Tory prime minister, John Major, described Eurosceptics in his cabinet as bastards. His bastards had nothing on Johnson’s.Take Leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg – a dangerous reactionary masquerading as a gentleman – for example. Rees-Mogghas long been one of those who sings from the Brexit hymnbook, where departure from the EU is all sunlit uplands. Last week, he found himself confronted, during a radio broadcast, by Dr David Nicholl about the risk to drug supplies posed by a no-deal Brexit. Inconveniently for Rees-Mogg , Dr Nicholl had been invited to contribute to the government’s contingency plans for No Deal and had raised concerns. On air, the neurologist asked the Commons leader what level of mortality rate he might be willing to accept in the light of a no-deal Brexit. Rees-Mogg rounded on Dr Nicholl, accusing him of “the worst excess of Project Fear”.When Dr Nicholl reminded Rees-Mogg that he had written the plans in mitigation contained in the government’s “Operation Yellowhammer” document, which predicts the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal, the cabinet minister sneered “well, you didn’t write very good plansyou hadn’t worked out how to mitigate”.This attack on an expert for failing to make facts tally with Rees-Mogg’s twisted reality would have been bad enough, but worse was to come when the Leader of the Commons used parliamentary privilege to compare Dr Nicholl to Andrew Wakefield, the disgraced former doctor struck off for his bogus claims that the MMR vaccine was linked to autism.Rees-Mogg, a coward, blithely abused the protection of the House of Commons in order to make an accusation that would have seen him suedhe’d repeated it outside. He later issued an apology.But Rees-Mogg is just a lickspittle, a supporting act in the Carnival of Crap which passes for our government. Boris Johnson is the huckster-in-chief.And what a performance he has delivered.Johnson stood for the Conservative leadership promising to uny the country and his party.On Tuesday, he withdrew the Tory whip from  MPs who voted with opposition parties to take control of Commons business in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit. This was unying in the same way that Rees-Mogg is honourable. After he ended the careersof the likes of former chancellors Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond, Winston Churchill’s grandson Nick Soames, and recent challenger for the Conservative leadership, Rory Stewart, the Prime Minister announced it was his plan to call a general election.Preferring to watch him flop about in the cesspit of his own creation, opposition parties refused to permit this.A day after the opposition united to kibosh Johnson’s election plans, the PM was hit by the resignation as a minister and an MP of his own brother, Jo, who said he could not reconcile family loyalty and the national interest. Andthat wasn’t grim enough, Johnson then attended a police academy in West Yorkshire where he made a wildly inappropriate – and barely coherent – campaign speech in front of number of cadets, one of whom fainted. The local chief constable later complained about the way his officers had been used by the PM.Johnson, we must never forget, is not a Brexiteer through conviction but because he judged that playing a leading role in the Leave campaign would maximise the possibility that he could become Prime Minister. Having signed this Faustian pact, he is now living with the consequences.So for the Prime Minister, the battle of Brexit isn’t about the pros and cons of EU membership, it isn’t about what’s best for the UK and its people, it’s about winning.This, too, is what motivates Rees-Mogg, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, and the scores of Little Englander politicians who pollute our discourse with their attacks on experts and their war metaphors. They must achieve Brexit – even of the most painful no-deal iety – at any cost because to fail would be to lose a culture war. Brexit must not be won so much as those opposed to it must be defeated.Euroscepticism is a flag around which those opposed to liberal values of openness and tolerance may rally. They might as well be campaigning to ban cats for all the value of the prize they seek.Brexiteers may claim they value sovereignty, they may claim they wish to “take back control” but, surely, events of the past week confirm that all they really care about is victory.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"looking back when a young jacob rees mogg campaigned in scotland with his nanny","story":"The Scotsman recalls his first foray into Scottish politics.Brexit campaigner Jacob Rees-Mogg started his political career back in Rees-Mogg was just  when he was selected by the Conservatives to contest Central Fe ndash a traditional Labour seat ndash at the  general election.The Etonian travelled to Scotland with a mind to hitting the campaign trail, but his upper-class background soon put him at odds with a largely working-class electorate.The son of late Times editor William, Rees-Mogg made the inauspicious decision to knock on doors in the former mining town of Leven on the Fe coast.But reports quickly emerged of the English candidate taking the familyrsquos nanny, Veronica Crook, in tow during canvassing while driving around the back streets of Fe in a Bentley.Rees-Mogg turned into cannon fodder, particularly for the tabloid newspapers.He was photographed in a pin-stripe suit visiting the doors of constituents in the Broom estate in Leven.Declarations by Rees-Mogg that people on benefits were the ldquoscourge of the earth didnrsquot help his position.Adding to his back story were reports of Rees-Mogg having to be saved by his Labour opponent Henry McLeish from being beaten up.McLeish told the Daily Record earlier this year: ldquoAt one point, somebody threatened to come onto the  and beat him up.ldquoA touching part to that was that after saving him from a potential duffing up, his father, the very distinguished editor of the Times, William Rees-Mogg, sent me a letter thanking me for how Irsquod managed to protect him, for which he was very grateful.Why your new suitable cabin baggage might actually fall foul of Ryanair rulesldquoIt was a delightful letter, basically saying lsquoI donrsquot often write to Labour MPs, but I would like to thank you very, very sincerely for the way you looked after my sonrsquo.ldquoJacob was like a fish out of water and clearly bewildered by places like Methil and Kennoway.ldquoI did not get the feeling he was the dangerous ideologue extremist we know him as today.ldquoHe was reasonably well behaved in my company because I think he was in fear of his le.ldquoThe fact he is looked upon by some as a future Prime Minister seems well beyond the realms of comprehension.

We’re not doing any deals with anyone. When we get into the next election I believe we will have a majority. When we get into the next election I believe we will have a majority.“Butwe’re a minority, we will have a minority government, we will not do coalitions - we’ve said no deals whatsoever.”The Scottish Government needs a transfer of power from Westminster - which controls the constitution - to hold a repeat of the  vote on independence.But he added: “I don’t think there should be another referendum. I think Scotland should stay united within the UK. It would not be a priority for us.“It may be for some folk, but we’ve got to deal with climate change and austerity etc...“It certainly wouldn’t be in the early years of a Labour Government. And there would have to be a proper mandate in Scotland - the Scottish people would have to decide.”The pro-independence SNP and Greens majority at the Scottish Parliament has already passedmotion calling for an independence referendum to be staged to provide Scots with an alternative to the chaos of Brexit.However, senior Scottish Labour figures in Scotland say the mandate secured by both parties in the  Holyrood did not explicitly set out demands for a second referendum, after Scots had been told the  vote was a “once in a generation” event.This could hint that it would take a clear majority for pro-independence parties would be required in the  Scottish Parliament elections.But the Conservatives in Scotland warned Labour would do a deal“One of the very few consistencies of the Labour party is its quest for the keys to Number ,” a Tory spokesman said.“Labour has repeatedly demonstrated it will happily trade the union down the river for the chance of entering Downing Street.“The Scottish Conservative party is the only party that can stop the SNP and stop Indyref.”Current polling suggests that Scotland is split down the middle on the issue of independence, with the most recent YouGov survey placing support remaining in the UK at %, while % backed remaining in the UK. The SNP is also poised for a sweeping victory in a snap election north of the border, possibly taking more than  of Scotland’s  seats.Nicola Sturgeon has said she will seek a section  order, allowing the transfer from Westminster to the Scottish Parliament, to test the ground for a second referendum, but it has been ruled out by Boris Johnson.SNP Deputy Westminster leader Kirsty Blackman said: “As the chaos at Westminster continues, it is increasingly unsustainable for dishonest Tory politicians, with no mandate in Scotland, to stand in the way of democracy.“The people of Scotland must have the opportunity to determine their own future - and in any coming election stopping Brexit and ensuring Scotland has the right to choose a better future with independence will be right at the centre of the SNP campaign.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp gains at general election would lend added weight for indyref2 demands","story":"SNP gains at a snap general election would lend #added weight# to the party#s demand to stage a second independence referendum, a constitutional expert has said.Recent polling suggests the Nationalists could expect to win back several constituencies lost at the last UK-wide poll in , while activists are confident their strong anti-Brexit message will resonate with voters disillusioned with the Conservatives’ handling of negotiations with the EU.But Nicola McEwen , co-director of the Centre on Constitutional Change, cautioned the “extraordinary” number of marginal seats north of the Border meant it was dficult to predict the result of an election yet to be formally declared.The academic said the SNP would be “more confident and assertive on independence” during the next campaign than in , when the party lost a third of its seats.“They will focus on opposition to Brexit, no deal, and Boris Johnson,” she said in an interview with Scotland on Sunday.She added: “If there is an election, I don’t think there will be straight drts in support from one party to another as so many complex issues are in play.“We have to be cautious about what the polls are saying for two reasons.

The Tories want us to leave the EU without a deal against the will of the people of Scotland.”Kirsty Blackman , the SNP’s deputy leader at Westminster, said the party relished the prospect of a general election, but was “taking nothing for granted”.“It’s clear the SNP is winning the support of voters, who trust us to stand up for their interests. As the chaos at Westminster continues, it is increasingly unsustainable for dishonest Tory politicians, with no mandate in Scotland, to stand in the way of democracy.“The people of Scotland must have the opportunity to determine their own future – and in any coming election stopping Brexit and ensuring Scotland has the right to choose a better future with independence will be right at the centre of the SNP campaign.”Meanwhile, Scottish Conservatives are facing the prospect of fighting an election without Ruth Davidson as leader.“There doesn’t appear to have been a drop-off in Conservative vote share in recent months given everything that’s gone on, but they don’t look capable of making gains,” said McEwen.“I think in the context of a campaign is where the loss of Ruth Davidson might be felt most acutely. We don’t know yet what role she would play, but recent elections proved she was a formidable campaigner.“She had more appeal in Scotland than Johnson, so almost acted like a counter-balance. It’s not obvious there is an alternative who can take up that role. I expect the Conservatives will do what worked so well for them in  – put opposition to independence at the front and centre of their campaign.”A spokesman for the Scots Tories said: “What is clear is that the SNP will exploit every opportunity to push for another isive independence referendum.“Only the Scottish Conservatives can stand up to the SNP.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable.

On Friday , Mrs Steenson received a call informing her that no bus was available due and mix-up between the EA and the transport provider. Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mrs Steenson said she had “issue after issue” during the summer months due to their errors.“My experience of it is that the Education Authority has a lot of people off sick, they are understaffed and there is a lot of pressure, and there just isn’t enough transport places available for the kids that need them. There are children being let down, and for us personally, it’s just not doable.

Another £, was donated to two English residents.The remainder of his estate, which included assets in Ireland, England, Singapore and New Zealand, was handed to the executors and trustees of his will - Joe Cahill and Dessie Mackin - for Sinn Fein.At the time Mr Cahill and Mr Mackin were the partys national treasurers. Their address is listed as  Parnell Square, which is the partys headquarters in Dublin.It was outlined in Mr Hamptons will that the money was to be used to cover election expenses, to fund Sinn Fein offices and advice centres, and to aid republican prisoners and their families in both Ireland and Britain.Mr Hamptons will stated: \"In the event that the organisation which is now known as Sinn Fein should cease to be in existence or should have split or taken a dferent name at the date of death then I direct that my executors and trustees are to apply my monies to the political party to which Mr Gerry Adams MP then belongs.\"\"Should Mr Adams pre-decease me or not be a member of any political party at the date of my death then I direct that my executors and trustees shall apply my monies to the republican or nationalist political party in the six counties, other than the SDLP, which has the largest number of elected councillors.\"Mr Hamptons donation was made public on Thursday by the Electoral Commission.A Probate Registry of Wales document confirms that when he died on January , , at a nursing home in Pembrokeshire, Mr Hampton left an estate in the UK worth £,,.However, at the time of writing his will in , he was living in a mobile home in Ireland.

The donation to Sinn Fein was paid to the party in instalments of £m and £, in April and May this year.The size of the UK estate and the mention of other global assets means that Sinn Fein may yet be in line for further donations from Mr Hampton.Under HM Revenue  Customs rules, Sinn Fein will not have to pay any inheritance tax on the £.m gt as any political party that has at least two MPs in the House of Commons is not liable to do so.Sinn Fein has seven MPs but because of a Westminster abstentionist policy they do not take their seats in the house.A political party also qualies for exemptionit has one MP and received no less than , votes at the last general election.

We worked with Nerve Visual to bring two of our most impactful exhibitions from the Ulster Museum to Derry.”The exhibitions referred to are Silent Testimony and Art of the Troubles. “Derry needs this gallery!” she added.The Nerve Centre reopened the former Turner Prize gallery space as Nerve Visual in June  when it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.A spokesperson for the Nerve Centre said it has received no core funding and was programmed and funded on a project by project basis.In just over three years it has hosted  successful exhibitions.However, writer and art critic Dominic Kearney said he couldn’t understand why it was so poorly attended, particularly as the Turner Prize was such a success at the same location.Nerve Visual only took over a section of the Creative Hub Building   in  but during the City of Culture year in  the same gallery space hosted the prestigious Turner Prize - one of the best-known visual arts prizes in the world.Mr Kearney believes the location is “terric” and “exactly” what Ebrington needs. “The space is perfect for a gallery and the exhibitions that they had there were very impressive.“The Troubles Art exhibition, Future Artist Makers and the Colin Davidson one was stunning, I’d hesitate to say beautul given the nature of its subject, but it was incredibly powerful.“It’s the only gallery that’s open to the public in Derry that deals with mainstream, accessible, representational art. For this to close is really going to detract from the local art scene, from Ebrington, the Waterside and Derry as a whole. Like a pebble dropped in a pond, the ripple effect will spread out from that building to the outer ring of the entire city.”He added: “It’s such a shame, in six years it’s gone from hosting the most prestigious modern art competition in UK to a couple of empty rooms.“People can only have so many cups of coffee, tourists need something to do when visiting the city. If there was a gallery dedicated to Irish art with links to galleries in Dublin, the Ulster Museum, and maybe Britain. Tourists would definitely want to go there as galleries are the type of thing people look for.”‘Massive draw’Local artists were regularly showcased at the Nerve Visual gallery.Stephen Lewis has lived in Derry for over  years, he’s an artist based at Bishop Street Studios who also works with the arts charities Creative Village Arts and ArtLink at Fort Dunree. He expressed his “disappointment” at the gallery’s closure.“There have been recent initiatives by the Nerve Visual, Tower Museum and An Culturalann to give folk here a chance to see art that is held in their own national collections - but it simply goes back to the inability to keep a space that is equipped to do this open.“People in the North West should not have to travel to Belfast to see their own art - The Ulster Museum often has  or  art exhibitions on at any one time - we built a world class gallery in  and we really should demand that this becomes our space to see our own art collections - properly advertised it could be a massive draw for locals and tourists alike.\"It’s understood there will be plenty of people interested in taking over occupancy of the building but at this stage it is unclear what will be based there.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

Competing in the competition for the first time, Andrew ploughed excellently over both days, winning a bronze medal on day one.With an aggregate score over the two days of competition used to crown the world champion, it was all to plough for on day two which focused on grassland.And Andrew was in good company with three former world champions making up the top five positions on the first day.He ploughed another fantastic plot to finish in fth place on day two, which placed him fourth overall, picking up the best newcomer award.Andrew said it has always been his dream to compete at the world contest.ldquoIt has been an unbelievable experience and I am so delighted to have won a medal. I am indebted for all the support I have received, particularly from my family, he said.Listooder Ploughing Society chairman Martin Gill spoke of his delight following the gala awards presentation.He said: ldquoTo go to the world contest for the first time, using borrowed equipment and to compete with the best in the world, winning a bronze medal and best newcomer title is a fantastic achievement.ldquoListooder has a long and successful history in ploughing. All three of our members who have competed at the world contest have all come home medal winners.In the reversible class, Hillsboroughrsquos James Coulter, who was also competing at the world contest for the first time, produced another fantastic performance.After finishing th on day one, James ploughed a fantastic plot the day after to win a bronze medal on grassland, finishing fourth overall and winning the best newcomer for the class.There will be little time for Andrew and James to celebrate as they prepare to compete in the Northern Ireland Championships at Cookstown this weekend..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin primary school opens new sensory garden  ","story":"CHILDREN, teachers and parents at St Maryrsquos Primary School, Aughlisnafin, celebrated the completion of a sensory garden and outdoor learning centre at the school with a barbecue and family fun night last Friday.The garden was officially opened by the school principal, Paddy Hardy, and Laura Brennan, chairperson of the schoolrsquos parent-teacher association.The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service and the RNLI were in attendance to advise the children on fire and water safety.Another special guest was Down gaelic footballer Rory Burns, who took on the children in a lsquoBeat the Goaliersquo competition.The school staff got involved by raising funds with a lsquoSponge the Teacherrsquo event which was a highlight for the children.A total of pound, was raised from all the activities and the barbecue.The school wishes to Fresh Food Centre, Castlewellan, Finnegans Butchers, Castlewellan, and Eurospar, Clough, for their donations.The school also wishes to thank everyone who attended the event for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Ban.jpg","title":"Ban on circuses with live animals  ","story":"CIRCUSES using live animals will be banned from performing throughout the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.The move calling for the council not to grant entertainment licences to circuses using live animals was passed at Monday nightrsquos full council meeting.It echoes back to a previous ban enforced by the legacy Down District Council which prohibited circuses with live animals performing on council facilities.The notice of motion, tabled by Alliance councillor Patrick Brown, was supported by  councillors. The only dissenting voice came from the DUPrsquos Harry Harvey, who voted against.The DUP councillor took an alternative view on the perceived harmful effect that circus le has on animals.Cllr Harvey said: ldquoI wonrsquot be supporting this motion as circus animals are very well trained and well trained animals are generally happy and well looked after.Cllr Brown told the meeting that many animals travelling with circuses were ldquosubjected to constantly being moved around cramped temporary housing, forced training and performance, loud noises and intimidating crowds of people.He continued: ldquoTravelling circus le is likely to have a harmful effect on animal welfare as captive animals are unable to socialise, get enough exercise or exhibit natural behaviours. Many animals develop behavioural and or health problems as a direct result of the captive le that they are forced to lead.He said that a recent report commissioned by the Welsh Government concluded that: ldquoLe for wild animals in travelling circuses... does not appear to constitute either a lsquogood lersquo or a lsquole worth livingrsquo.ldquoThe Irish government recently saw footage from the Animal Defenders International group which showed elephants and camels being repeatedly punched and hit with sticks to perform, said Cllr Brown.He added: ldquoIn May, the UK Government announced it would be banning wild animals in circuses from early . The Irish Government banned wild animals in January .ldquoAs usual, this being a devolved issue, Northern Ireland is behind the times yet again. This issue was actually raised in the Assembly as far back as  by my good friend Jim Wells MLA, who was very critical of the failure of Michelle OrsquoNeillrsquos Agriculture department to include such provisions in the Welfare of Animals Act .The councillor argued that some of the worldrsquos best circuses, such as the Cirque de Soleil, ddid not use any animals which ldquoreflects a global trend towards human-centered performances that no longer use animals, including the Russian and Chinese state circuses.He added: ldquoHopefully council will lead the way on animal welfare and pass this motion.The motion was seconded by fellow Alliance councillor Gregory Bain.Downpatrick SDLP councillor John Trainer, who also supported the motion said circuses did not provide a natural habitat for animals.DUP councillor Billy Walker, UUP councillor David Taylor and Sinn Feacuteinrsquos Willie Clarke all supported the motion on behalf of their respective parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Community.jpg","title":"Community bid to halt church’s sale of Crossgar centre  ","story":"CHURCH officials in Crossgar are being asked to abort plans to sell a building and consider donating it to local people instead.The community centre in Downpatrick Street mdash which was a former pub mdash was purchased two decades ago but is now on the market for sale as a commercial unit.Representatives of the Church of the Immaculate Conception and St Joseph are planning to meet with community representatives to explain the reasons for the sale which are understood to centre around increased running costs and reduced numbers of people using the facility.Community officials have expressed an interest in working with Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take over the running of the building,agreement could be reached to donate it to the people of Crossgar.They believe that the building offers major potential and could be developed to provide a range of services to meet the needs of a wide range of cross-community groups in the village.Community representatives want the meeting with church officials to be open to localpeople, arguing that a lot of public money has already been invested in the property over recent years which is used by the Crossgar Youth League among others.ldquoThe building could be transformed into a modern community centre with the right investment and commitment. There is a parking area at the rear with spaces for around  vehicles andthese are lost what happens, especially during the summer months when the villagersquos popular Youth League is in full flow, said one community official.ldquoLocal people have been using the property for around  years and we would very much like church officials to consider donating it to them so they can take it over and work with others to manage the running costs.Community officials say there was a need for a dedicated indoor community facility in Crossgar which would meet the needs of many groups and organisations.The added ldquoplans for a major new sports complex unveiled a number of years never came to fruition and were unlikely to in the future.Officials believe thatthe Downpatrick Street building was donated to the people of the village, its future as a community base could potentially be guaranteed.Community officials insist that one of their key priorities is looking after Crossgar Youth League which continues to go from strength to strength and also uses the car park at the rear of the building to store equipment.ldquoIt is no onersquos fault that the Downpatrick Street building is being sold. If there are concerns around its running costs why doesnrsquot the parish come and talk to us and give us the opportunity to work alongside others and take it over  suggested one community official.ldquoThere was a major push to open this building many years ago and a lot of public money was invested in it. The property is critical to the success of the Crossgar Youth League and is an enormous community benefit. It is the best thing we have in the village.ldquoThe loss of the building would have an enormous impact on the Youth League and indeed the Crossgar community. There is potential to do so much with the property and we hope it is not lost to the people of the village. We are asking for an opportunity to let us try and maximise its value to Crossgar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Delight.jpg","title":"Delight over confirmation for new road crossing  ","story":"A LONG campaign to enhance pedestrian safety in the centre of Killyleagh has reached a successful conclusion.Roads officials have confirmed that an existing pedestrian crossing in Catherine Street will be replaced by a new puffin crossing which will result in the provision of the townrsquos first ever traffic lights.The existing pedestrian crossing is being moved further along the busy main road and will be installed as part of a new pound, environmental improvement scheme which will result in the provision of new street lights and furniture. Existing paths will also be upgraded.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker mdash who has been lobbying for the existing pedestrian crossing to be upgraded mdash is delighted that it is finally going to happen.ldquoThe scheme has been included in the Department for Infrastructurersquos programme and will be installed as pat of the forthcoming environmental improvement scheme, he explained.ldquoI am delighted that after years of lobbying, this much-needed scheme is finally now in the programme and will be delivered. I hope that it will be delivered as soon as possible, given the huge volume of traffic which passes through the centre of the town each day.Cllr Walker said a number of traffic surveys have been carried out over the years to determine the need for an upgraded crossing and is pleased that one is finally going to be delivered and will be paid for by the Department for Infrastructure.ldquoThe importance of this puffin crossing cannot be highlighted enough, he continued. ldquoThe new crossing will see the provision of Killyleaghrsquos first set of traffic lights which in itself is signicant. The traffic lights will ensure drivers come to a complete halt while people are crossing.Cllr Walker said a number of people using the existing pedestrian crossing were hit by cars, while there were ldquocountless near misses.ldquoWhen people press the button on the new puffin crossing, traffic will stop immediately to allow them to cross safely. My thanks go to roads officials for finally agreeing that an upgraded crossing is necessary, he continued.ldquoThe biggest concern many in Killyleagh have is the speed of vehicles approaching Catherine Street from the Comber direction.

But he conceded that theof -hour AE services may be dficult.Mr McGoran was invited to address the Down Community Health Committee and said it was important that the South Eastern Trust was having a conversation with campaigners who are keen to continue discussions with officials to ensure the retention of existing services and the delivery of enhanced provision moving forward.Over previous years, relations between both organisations was particularly fraught at times and while they did not always see eye to eye, Mr McGoran hopes they can now move forward together.He said he had ldquonothing but respect for the Down community because local people cared about their health and social care services, committing time and energy to make sure the area gets the best provision it can.ldquoThis is not always obvious everywhere in Northern Ireland, Mr McGoran continued. ldquoYou have been at this for a long time and I have no doubt that without your campaigning work we would not have some of the things we have in this organisation today. I am also not sure that we would have the Downe Hospital.ldquoYour contribution and those who went before you has been fundamental in keeping this area in the spotlight, fighting ultimately for your services. I take my hat off to you. The Downe is here to stay and we have a fantastic facility and there are no staff better. In fact, we have incredible staff who work right across the organisation.Mr McGoran said that while administrators and campaigners may not have always agreed in the past about how the health trust did things, he suggested they all had the same aim mdashwanting the best health and social care that could be delivered, sometimes within challenging resources.Looking to the future, the health chief referred to an ongoing review of emergency care which has resulted in the group overseeing the exercise visiting the Downe and meeting with senior health officials.ldquoI do envisage that there is going to be further change for emergency medicine but when I was asked the question what did I think about the future of the service at the Downe, Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals in  yearsrsquo time, I could not really answer that, explained Mr McGoran.ldquoI was prepared to say what it would be like in five yearsrsquo time, but could not look beyond that. A five year vision is really something that you can get a hold of and we made it clear to those in charge of the review that the emergency care model we have in place at the Downe will be here in five yearsrsquo time.Mr McGoran said the health trust was on record with the Department of Health during the early stages of the current engagement that it still sees the current model at the Downe comprising the emergency department, out of hours GP service and weekend nurse-led minor injuries unit remaining in place.ldquoWe will still have acute beds in the Downe and it will deal with medically unwell patients. All of the current infrastructure we have will remain in place and our vision is to expect these to remain in place for the next five years, he confirmed.Mr McGoran said the one caveat was that it remained to be seen what the Department of Health will do with the information it has been provided with in relation to the future of emergency care, suggesting serious conversations about the way forward have only just begun.He added: ldquoThere is work ongoing and at some point there may be a consultation exercise. I do not know where all this is going to go and it is a bit early to speculate.Community Health Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady welcomed the health officialrsquos ldquoconstructive and honest engagement with campaigners.He said: ldquoWe need to go forward in a partnership, but that does not mean that we will always agree. Our community supports the Downe Hospital and also the centres of excellence in the bigger hospitals that our delivering our health needs.ldquoBut we need as much care as possible provided as locally as possible, safely and well adequately resourced in a brilliant building.Mr McGrady added: ldquoI hope that in five yearsrsquo time we will be looking at a very major extension at the Downe and a major increase in capacity.

mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy

without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors

This was foreseen in the design of St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse where there is excellent lantern sidewall and cowling ventilation in a tower  feet above the ground in this remote location. There is little hazard from the liquid mercury since it is not readily absorbed dermally.Campaigners have suggested that it would be interesting to see CILrsquos lighthouse keeper health monitoring records for mercury covering the past  years and more when the lighthouse was manned and used the present system. They also said it would be interestingto see the training records for keepers in safe mercury handling during all these years. ldquoPresumably, these would have been managed by independent bodies of experts since the Commissioners probably didnrsquot previously have and donrsquot today have any toxicological experts on your permanent payroll, says the campaigners letter.Another area of concern highlighted is the poor state of the lighthouse, including adjoining housing which a delegation from the Commissionerrsquos office recently visited.Campaigners point to the ldquolamentable state of the walls of the lighthouse station and the grounds, suggesting that they present a picture of ldquowoeful neglect and asking how CIL can expect the public to be impressed with a lack of basic asset maintenance.The letter highlights that the current Fresnel lens system turns  hours a day and is clearly visible from the road outside the lighthouse station.Campaigners say this in itself is a visual attraction during daylight hours ldquosince the magnicent large lens system is big enough to be seen turning on itrsquos mercury bearing and is even more magnicent at night.The letter continues: ldquoWe believe that CIL will miss a tremendous opportunity to preserve this lighthouse and its sweeping beamyou persist with your alternative bearing plans. The whole lighthouse station could become part of a wider tourist attraction in the area. Future generations will thank you for retaining the current historic beam system, still going smoothly after  years and showing no signs of obsolescence. You have not made an economic case for change of lens system at St Johnrsquos Point as far as we know and it is dficult to see how you can.ldquoWhat happens at the lighthouse remains the focus of keen and widespread local and political interest in this area and we will ensure this continues to be a high-profile local issue.The letter adds: ldquoLecale Lightkeepers are willing to fully support CIL and others in any preservation programme that involves retaining the sweeping beam. However, we reject the idea that the use of mercury in this lens bearing application represents a health hazard that cannot be managed by a sensible, low-cost maintenance programme involving chiefly adequate ventilation.

in the history of Northern Ireland politics.The executors of his will, Joe Cahill and Dessie Mackin, had previously held senior positions within the IRA and were Sinn Fein’s treasurers at the time the will was made, in .Last week the Electoral Commission said it had no concerns about the money and would not be launching an investigation.It is thought Sinn Fein could be in line for further donations

Image: BBC SpotlightAlthough it has long been known that Mr McGuinness was an IRA commander, he refused to discuss his actions in the organisation and insisted that he had never killed anyone.The images will be broadcast next Tuesday in the first part of one of BBC Northern Ireland’s most ambitious projects, a two-year re-examination of the Troubles which will run over seven programmes. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The first programme in the series also includes a former colonel saying that he was shown evidence by the RUC that Ian Paisley, the future First Minister, had supplied the money for explosives which caused one of the first explosions of the Troubles.The rare footage of an IRA car bomb being assembled was filmed in Londonderry in the early years of the Troubles.During the programme, former IRA bomber Shane Paul O’Doherty commentated on the pictures, saying: “There’s a huge charge there. A very dangerous alarm clock timer that could blow them all to hell.”When asked who he recognised, he said: “Well, there’s Martin....Martin McGuinness.” Mr O’Doherty said he was certain that it was the future deputy First Minister, saying “nobody walks like him, with a stoop in his back”.The car containing the bomb could be identied by its number plate. The BBC programme includes footage of the bomb exploding  minutes later in the centre of Mr McGuinness’s home city, Londonderry.The day after the bombing, Northern Ireland Prime Minister Brian Faulkner was brought to London to be told that security powers would be removed from Stormont and taken on by Westminster, leading to the collapse of Stormont.The Spotlight programme also includes footage of Mr McGuinness showing guns to young children and handing them bullets while seated in a car.Commentating on the film pictures, Mr O’Doherty said: “It’s Martin McGuinness.

However, Spotlight reporter Darragh MacIntyre said that it would be made clear in a future film in the series.He said that it had been shot by an American documentary maker and was never broadcast.Mr McIntyre, the reporter who in  exposed the then DUP MP Iris Robinson’s affair and financial dealings with property developers, said that the  footage “speaks to a time when within Free Derry and where in the north there was a sense that the IRA had it won, that they were the original guerrilla fighters and within a matter of months would see their way to a new united Ireland...so they were quite free - not just Martin McGuinness - when they were filming with this documentary team”.In , Mr McGuinness told the journalist Eamonn Mallie that he was “very proud that I was a part of the IRA in Derry” but declined to say whether he had ever killed anyone.Last month, former IRA member Kieran Conway said that as the IRA’s chief of staff at the time of the attack which killed Lord Mountbatten and others, including two children, Mr McGuinness had to “take responsibility” for what had happened that day.Another former IRA man, Anthony McIntyre, said of that attack: “If they knew about the children, and were quite prepared to go ahead and to sacrice their lives in order to get Mountbatten, then it’s a war crime”.However, Sinn Féin MLA and former IRA man Raymond McCartney denounced such criticism of Mr McGuinness, saying that he was “held in the highest of esteem across Ireland and internationally”.The Foyle MLA said: “It is reprehensible that anyone would make unfounded allegations against a man who is no longer here to defend himself.”Spotlight on The Troubles – a Secret History involve two -minute programmes and five hour-long episodes. The series has been overseen by editor Jeremy Adams, deputy editor Gwyneth Jones and producer Chris Thornton. It involves three senior Spotlight reporters – Darragh MacIntyre, Jenner O’Leary and Mandy McAuley.The first programme will be broadcast on BBC One NI on Tuesday at .pm and will also be shown on BBC

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

out how much it costs  ","story":"Do you want to complain about a neighbour#s high hedge  It#s going to cost you five times more in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council area.That’s £ - five times more than any other area in NI, says AllianceCllr Eóin Tennyson.Cllr Tennysonsays the Council must make it easier for people to deal with high hedges.He said: “As it stands, where mediation fails in dealing with concerns around high hedges – which can often be a real nuisance and source of frustration and stress for people affected – raising an official complaint in the ABC area costs up to five times more than other areas in NI.“Often people dealing with high hedge disputes have no choice but to make an official complaint, which is why it is dficult to comprehend why ABC Council insists on charging applicants £ – adding financial strain to an already stressful situation.“While the fee is ed to the applicantthe complaint is upheld, this is still a large outlay which can be prohibitive for residents seeking resolution to a problem that has often been lingering for some time.“The fee is set by Councils, so while in other areas like Derry and Strabane Council it costs £ to pursue a complaint, I must question why the fee is so excessive for people to access the same service in the ABC area.“That’s why we are not only calling for a review of the costs of high hedge complaints in ABC Council, but have urged officers to advance the development of a mediation toolkit or resource to help resolve a greater number of disputes at an earlier stage.”A Council spokesperson said: “The matter of high hedges was raised at this week’s Environmental Services Committee. It was agreed that a report, which would include how the fee was set within the framework of the council’s fee setting policy and the investigation process, would be brought to next month’s Environmental Services Committee.”Princess Charlotte arrives for first day of school - accompanied by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
