The Sentinelese attracted international attention in the wake of the 2004 Asian tsunami, when a member of the tribe was photographed on a beach, firing arrows at a helicopter (pictured)          Chau took a boat ride with the fishermen before venturing alone in a canoe to North Sentinel Island Shortly after his death in November, his parents John and Lynda Chau, who live in Washington State, revealed they had forgiven the tribe and urged Indian authorities to release the local men who Chau paid to take him close to the island.\u0027He loved God, life, help those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people.\u0027We forgive those reportedly responsible for his death.

John Chau\u0027s mother Lynda (left) claimed she had forgiven the tribe and urged Indian authorities to release the local men who Chau paid to take him close to the islandThe Andaman and Nicobar Police Department later arrested seven people including five fishermen and two of Chau\u0027s friends, alleging that they helped him get to the island despite it being illegal for anyone to go there.It still remains unclear if the police department has merely opened a murder investigation for the purposes of thoroughness or if they intend to level charges against the group which would pose a labyrinth of logistical and ethical challenges given its status as a protected tribe. Chau had written a letter to his parents before he kayaked to the island. In it, he told them not to hold the tribe responsible for his death if he did not come back alive.Before he was killed, he tried to approach the island at least one other time and was shot at.He described how an arrow pierced his bible as he approached them.\u0027I hollered, My name is John, I love you and Jesus loves you,\u0027 he wrote in his diary.

There were people who, in good faith, were sometimes as angry as you are, and they said that the source of all their ills was Europe.

Wilson, who was arrested and questioned but never charged with any offence, later tried to Ms Ingram for harassment, seeking £10,000 in damages from the mother-of-twoTears filled Carley Ingram’s eyes as she told a police officer how her landlord, Fergus Wilson, had abused her trust. Reporting what she believed to have been a sexual assault was traumatic, but her burning sense of injustice overrode any feelings of fear.She was relieved when Wilson was arrested over her allegations. But, four months later, the investigation was closed. ‘The police said there wasn’t any evidence,’ says Carley, 39, who was evicted from her two-bedroom home the week after Mr Wilson’s arrest.Mr Wilson has not been charged with any offence and must be treated as innocent of these allegations. However, Carley assumed that she would at least finally be able to put the landlord out of her mind.She assumed wrong.In January 2015, eight months after Carley made the allegation against Mr Wilson, she received a letter from the 70-year-old, who along with wife Judith, 68, has been labelled Britain’s biggest and most disliked buy-to-let landlord, announcing he was going to sue her.The Wilsons — who at one stage owned around 1,000 properties in Kent and have amassed an estimated £225m fortune — were suing Carley, a single, cash-strapped mother of two small children, for £10,000 for harassment because, Mr Wilson claimed her allegation was malicious.The action by the Wilsons, who have just announced plans to sell their remaining 300 properties, crashing local house prices and potentially leaving scores of tenants homeless, almost destroyed Carley. And her sad story is just one of the many that a Daily Mail investigation into Mr Wilson’s business practices has uncovered.‘I was physically sick when I got that letter,’ she says. ‘I only did what I thought was right.’Family pray for a miracle as rescuers searching for Spanish...Sex offender, 34, admits murdering man, 66, who showed off...Share this articleAfter two-and-a-half years of vicious claim and counter-claim, a judge at Maidstone County Court ruled in August 2017 that Mr Wilson had no grounds to sue.

I’ve called the Samaritans and woken up screaming,’ she says. ‘Wilson ruined my life.’          Fergus Wilson, pictured with his wife Judith, outside one of their buy-to-let properties in Ashford, Kent, said the allegations were totally \u0027unfounded\u0027.

Certainly she would not interest me’Family pray for a miracle as rescuers searching for Spanish...Sex offender, 34, admits murdering man, 66, who showed off...Share this articleAsk Mr Wilson, on the other hand, what it was like being wrongly accused of sexual assault — surely among the most devastating allegations a man could face — and he sounds cross, but far from crushed.Talking to me on the phone this week, he said Carley made a ‘totally’ unfounded allegation because she was behind on her rent and angry at being made to leave her home — something his former tenant firmly denies.And then he digresses, at pains to stress that Carley is not his ‘cup of tea’ anyway, which is why, apparently, his wife of 50 years was untroubled by the allegations: ‘Judith knows full well that I don’t like big fat ladies. Basically she wasn’t a very attractive lady. Certainly she would not interest me.’By his own admission a colossus of a man who steamrollers over conversation and appears capable of causing offence every time he opens his mouth, he is, nonetheless, apparently eager to exercise his own form of diplomacy.‘Many of your readers will be ladies who are perhaps overweight and I’m not trying to upset anybody. Basically, my preference is for nice thin ladies.’ And then he asks me: ‘Are you a nice slim lady, or a big lady, dear?’In the context of a conversation about an alleged sexual assault, his remarks seem inappropriate. But they are perhaps unsurprising.          Atilla Lant, 45, from Ashford, Kent, was sued by the Wilsons who claimed he caused £4,000 in damage to their property. The damage was caused by a faulty boiler which the Wilsons refused to fix. They later lost in court and were ordered to pay £2,500 in compensation to Mr LantThis is the man, after all, who in 2014 hit an estate agent over the head in an argument over a boiler.In 2017, a leaked email to a letting agency revealed that he had a policy of not permitting ‘coloured people’ to rent his properties because they made ‘houses smell like curry’ — a ban later overturned by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.This week he told me: ‘No coloured persons seem to have taken offence that I’m aware of. They’re saying it’s sound advice. If you’re in Ashford trying to sell your Asian-occupied house to a white person, for goodness sake get rid of the curry smell first.’Although he denies being racist, he remains staunchly unrepentant as to his appalling remarks on people of different races. Instead, he says he takes more than his ‘fair share’ of Ashford’s black families and ‘we have to accept curry is difficult to get out of the wallpaper’.The same year, leaked letting criteria also reportedly revealed he had banned single mothers, abused women, those earning under £30,000 a year and plumbers — most of whom he suggested he either considered troublesome, likely to lead to damaged properties or prone to falling behind on rent.Last month Judith — in whose name most of the Ashford properties are believed to be registered — was ordered to pay £25,000 in fines and legal costs for failing to supply hot water to a disabled tenant.The defeat prompted a petulant outburst from Mr Wilson, who said: ‘Following my wife’s conviction for not restoring hot water, she immediately withdrew from letting further houses in Ashford and has greatly accelerated the disposal of her portfolio. This will result in a flooded market in Ashford and a drop in house prices by £50,000 to £100,000.’Yet, not so long ago, the Wilsons were widely respected as aspirational entrepreneurs in Ashford. Both former maths teachers, the couple, who have two middle-aged daughters, acquired their first buy-to-let property in 1986, subsequently acquiring a massive portfolio of starter homes in the sought-after commuter town.By the early Noughties, they had monopolised the area, at one stage purchasing a house a day, their wealth increasing by some £70,000 between breakfast and dinner as property prices soared.          The broken boiler caused considerable damage in the house Mr Lant had rentedNeither Fergus Wilson, one of nine siblings and the working-class son of a Ford car plant foundry worker, nor Judith, whose father ran a nursery business, flaunted their burgeoning bank balance. They drove second-hand cars, shunned holidays and endearingly insisted their wealth ‘didn’t really mean anything’.But Mr Wilson’s recent disparaging comments mean respect for the couple has been replaced with revulsion.The couple live in a relatively modest £1.25 m home on the outskirts of Maidstone, surrounded by four Dobermanns and a sign outside the front gate reading ‘Smile, you’re on CCTV’ .And — sadly for poor Carley — they still have her in their sights.‘All Wilson does is belittle and insult,’ says Carley, whose sons were aged six and ten at the time she reported Mr Wilson to the police.She recalls how happy she was to move into Mr Wilson’s two-bedroom property in 2013, paying £800 a month in rent: ‘It was near the children’s school and my best friend lived down the road,’ she recalls.Mr Wilson met Carley on the morning of May 7, 2014 to investigate a window broken during a previous tenancy. Mr Wilson says that during this time Carley ‘ended up telling me all the problems in the world’ before he left ‘at the appropriate time’.          Wilson has claimed he is suing Kent Police for £1m over their handling of the investigation into Ms Ingram\u0027s allegationsOf course, Carley’s account differs, but because the police found no evidence to corroborate her claims, the Mail cannot repeat her allegations. It appears she was more affected as a result than Mr Wilson, who, when I ask if he was upset about being arrested, says, ‘only for a relatively short period of that day because it took so much time up’, — time, he says, when ‘I could have been earning money’.When, the following January, Carley learned she was being sued for £10,000 (the maximum Mr Wilson could sue her for), her distress intensified. With only around £200 spare after paying her rent each month, she says she couldn’t begin to prepare for the potential pay-out if she lost.‘Every time I got letters my stomach would flip.’ Even though Mr Wilson now can’t sue Carley, he has no intention of laying the matter to rest. He says he is suing Kent Police for £1 m for their handling of the case — a ‘claim for compensation’ police say they are unable to comment on — and intends to use his considerable fortune to take out a private prosecution against Carley for perverting the course of justice.Surely he’s not still after her money? ‘She doesn’t have any money,’ he says. Instead, he intends to land her in prison.‘If she’s convicted she’ll get a custodial sentence. It’s a principle. You cannot have people like this lady carrying on.’Strangely, however, Wilson insists he isn’t bothered by other smears against him, dismissing many as ‘fake news’.The Wilsons’ business has also, he says, been impacted by a lack of workmen willing to repair his properties in this Brexit era, leading to an influx of tenant complaints. ‘We were so reliant on European workers who’ve returned home. Can you find me some Eastern Europeans?’ he asks.Emma Beaney, 26, was forced to move from one of the Wilsons’ houses last April after three years. During her tenancy, Emma, a hairdresser, married to Shane, 27, a factory worker, says the bathroom flooded three times and pipework under the sink broke.‘On one occasion, we waited two weeks for the bathroom to be fixed. He never fixed the pipes under the sink — we had to throw the water from our washing up bowl away outside, until my parents’ neighbour fixed it. There were so many leaks that didn’t dry out and the house was always damp and cold. Shane and I ended up arguing. It was so stressful.’Last January, Emma says Shane kept getting electric shocks from the sockets: ‘Then one day the wall got wet from where, we realised, the boiler had been leaking.‘Buckets we put underneath it overfilled every night. The front of the house was flooded.’After Emma messaged Mr Wilson on a Tuesday, he sent someone to investigate that Thursday before 3pm — although she had explained she would be at work and they would be unable to enter. Emma then told him she was legally entitled to request 24 hours’ notice of a landlord visit. ‘That obviously annoyed him,’ she recalls. ‘He told me I was overflowing the bath and didn’t know what a leak was. Then he said he wanted my husband and me to find somewhere else to live.’The ‘upset and angry’ couple moved out two months later. ‘It’s disgusting he doesn’t feel responsibility towards his tenants,’ says Emma. ‘He makes my blood boil.’      "},{"url":null,"title":"Three sacks human remains including bones BABIES wash beach","story":"   Three sacks of human remains - including the bones of babies - have washed up on a beach in New Zealand (stock image)\u0027We had locals and members of the public picking up bones for at least a week since the slip, that included two young boys finding a jaw bone,\u0027 he told the Bay of Plenty Times.Among the bones found were a child\u0027s forearm and two skulls, Mr Tapsell said. Shocking pictures of dozens of dead brumbies emerge by dry...Second black box is found alongside human remains from Lion...Share this articleAs a result of the discovery, the collection of seafood was banned at the beach for six weeks on January 14. The found bones will be held by the police until they could be buried again. People from across New Zealand have contacted Mr Tapsell to say they believed they were descendants of those buried at the site.

I’m scared of people who manipulate you with miracle ideas.’Mr Macron was speaking on Thursday evening to an audience in Bourg-de-Peage, south of Lyon, in a ‘people’s debate’.          Rubbishing the June 2016 referendum in which a majority of the British voted to exit the EU, the head of state said: ‘Be aware of people who sell you dreams, that tell you all your anger can be solved by a referendum. I’m scared of people who manipulate you with miracle ideas’Some were so-called Yellow Vest anti-government campaigners who themselves want France to leave the EU.But Mr Macron told them: ‘Take the British. They voted for Brexit. There were people who, in good faith, were sometimes as angry as you are, and they said that the source of all their ills was Europe. It’s rubbish!’Attacking Brexit poster campaigns that in 2016 promised more money for the NHS and other good causes, Mr Macron said: ‘There were lots of buses passing by reading that you were going to save something like 36 billion pounds if you get out of Europe.‘And it will be done in 15 days, and then people voted. There were people who voted for Brexit, who did it in good faith, they were angry, and they thought their situation was impossible, because the system was unjust.In a clear reference to former Conservative politicians including Prime Minister David Cameron, who resigned after losing the Brexit referendum, Mr Macron whistled as he mocked their departures.‘The result is, it’s in fact been going on for two years now and those who promised a Brexit literally left within two weeks. They didn’t even want to govern!It follows Mr Macron saying that Britain leaving the EU without a deal would be a disaster for everyone, and especially the British.Instead, he believes the UK will now ask for more time to negotiate a new trade deal.Speaking more widely about the issue of referendums, Mr Macron said they were a poor form of democracy, that could be manipulated by fake news, and that parliamentary government should be respected at all times.  Amber Rudd warns May she could quit to block a no-deal BrexitAmber Rudd warned the Prime Minister she could quit the Cabinet to back a plan to block no deal.The Work and Pensions Secretary said she would \u0027wait and see\u0027 what the orders to Tory MPs were on Tuesday night - insisting she wanted a free vote.Tuesday sees the next stage of the Brexit drama come to a head as MPs vote on Theresa May\u0027s Plan B and a raft of amendments on what to do next.

Did I sense any regret about the situation he’d left behind? Not really’ This picture has actually lost me a few jobs. Plus I think I might even have lost a flat because of it. I was looking at a property and was chatting to the estate agent and told them that I’d recently shot David Cameron. We put an offer in – for the asking price – but it was turned down. So yes, I do suspect people don’t like David Cameron.But when you shoot someone like Cameron, though, you have to remain neutral. If you turn up thinking too many things then you’ll inevitably forget something, or position the lighting wrong, and the subject will get irritated. You have to go in with clarity. Whether you’re a former prime minister or a bus driver, I’ll always have the same clarity of thought.The photograph came about as part of a project I was working on, aiming to capture interesting faces in the style of artists such as Holbein and Caravaggio. It took place in Cameron’s office, almost exactly one year after his resignation. My degree is in medieval history, and so shooting people who are part of our history like this gives me an excuse to touch history.He arrived in his gym clothing, which was rather funny, and he was worried he looked a bit pasty. I explained my ideas, and about how I wanted to capture this sort of meditative statesman feeling. I wanted a sense of looking backwards at the current political situation.I was worried that Cameron might be a difficult person to photograph, but as a sitter he proved to be a darling. He had a lot of patience. You have to separate politics from the person, and he was a charming chap.I knew the public would be wondering, what is he thinking? That’s why I wanted him in this pose, shot in profile. There are no other pictures of Cameron like this – the others normally capture the signature “call me Dave” look. But now he’s not in power he can afford to show more emotion and try different poses.I do think the contemplation was genuine. I’ve worked with a lot of actors in Los Angeles so I know what faking it looks like. I’ve also worked with many politicians, both Conservative and Labour, and when I ask for a certain look, some of them can turn around instantly with that expression. But David seemed to me a genuine guy, a family man, who had a real sense of the seriousness of office. Did I sense any regret about the situation he’d left behind? Not really.However, I never mentioned the B-word during the half hour we had for the sitting. I decided that wouldn’t have been a good idea. But he seemed very happy to talk about other things throughout his career. He told me that the most interesting place he’d visited was Libya after Gaddafi.I was inspired by Sir James Guthrie, the realist painter who depicted a lot of politicians straight after the first world war. They’d experienced all that horror and history, and he captured that moment. Backdrops are important for me. Guthrie painted in a muddy brown, suggestive of the trenches. I went with a fading blue backdrop. You can interpret that as the European flag fading away, or simply as the blue of Conservatism.I’m a realist photographer so I like to capture everything – the grey hairs, blotchy skin, all the details and lines. I want to say – this was the true image of David Cameron at this moment in history.He’s not the first leader I’ve photographed – I did John Major back in 2017 for another project. When I went to shoot him there was a sense of betrayal there. It was in his mouth, in his breath. But with David there was not that sense. He was energetic, almost raring to go. There was a restlessness I could really sense. I think he wants to return after this Brexit situation is resolved. I think he’ll be back.Born: Chester, 1982.Training: King’s College London.Influences: Caravaggio, Titian, Ribera, HolbeinHigh point: ‘Sir Patrick Stewart portrait sitting, New York.’Low point: ‘Not picking up a camera after I graduated.’Top tip: ‘Direction, direction, direction: break the ice with your subjects.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/489d18d6f3822d33cbe2ceca9609e550be49c10c/0_0_3809_3000/master/3809.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d7ed4a40d300daa1caa50f49bba15d2 480w","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

Fears are growing over the levels of global trade, given the standoff between the US and China, while the slowdown in the Chinese economy has lowered demand for UK manufactured goods. The car industry, also struggling with a new set of rules around vehicle emissions, has been particularly hard hit, dragging UK economic growth close to a standstill.Britain’s budget deficit, the gap between spending and income from taxes, was higher than expected in December, as the government spent more than it received. Although the UK’s finances are steadily improving on an annual basis, the performance over the last month was worse than the City expected. Borrowing was about £3bn, versus an estimate of £1.9bn. The Office for National Statistics said the UK’s contribution to the EU budget was £1.5bn higher than in December 2017 transfers to Brussels can fluctuate at the end of each year.UK car sales fell at the fastest rate since the world plunged into recession a decade ago, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. While consumer demand has waned as the Brexit vote dents households’ finances and knocks confidence in making big purchases, several other problems have plagued the car industry. Factories struggled to adapt to new emissions tests brought in late last year after the VW emissions scandal, while sales in China fell for the first time in almost 30 years as the Chinese economy slows. UK growth has slowed as a consequence, while Germany slipped into recession in the second half of 2018 in a sign of the wider malaise.

When the opposition triumphed in elections for the national assembly in 2015, he stripped the body of its powers and set up the National Constituent Assembly instead through dubious elections. Last year he won an equally dodgy presidential vote boycotted by the opposition. Opposition leaders are jailed or have fled into exile protesters have been arbitrarily detained and tortured. While some still believe Mr Maduro continues the work of his charismatic predecessor, Hugo Chávez, even many Chavistas have turned against him. An unpopular president relies on control of the judiciary and military support.These desperate times have united the splintered opposition, for now at least, around Juan Guaidó, the youthful and barely known figure who heads the national assembly and has just declared himself acting president. He is backed by Donald Trump, usually so enamoured of authoritarian leaders and careless of human rights, who has taken an uncharacteristic stand in a country which happens to have the world’s largest proven oil reserves. Canada and most members of the Lima group regional bloc have also recognised Mr Guaidó, reflecting the broader risks posed by Venezuela’s unravelling, and the inability to find another way forward, as well as the rightward shift in the region. The EU has been somewhat cagier.Mr Trump’s move is risky as well as cynical. Latin America has plentiful experience of the cost of US-led interference and military “solutions” to crises. Russia, which sent two bombers to Venezuela last month in an unsubtle show of support for Mr Maduro, has warned that US actions could have “catastrophic consequences”. China, the country’s largest creditor, is standing by him so are Turkey and Mexico.The question is what comes next. Clearly the opposition’s aim is that the military, particularly lower down the chain of command, can be chipped away. The concomitant risk is of rival factions turning upon each other. The other issue is what happens to US diplomats if they ignore orders to leave the country. Some suspect a pretext for further action by Mr Trump, who reportedly mooted an invasion several times in 2017 and says “all options” are on the table if Mr Maduro cracks down on the opposition. Brazil’s new far right president Jair Bolsonaro has made his sympathies clear. The prospect of military intervention is terrifying, and could make the current catastrophe far worse.It is clear that Venezuela cannot recover while Mr Maduro is in charge. Research has suggested most Venezuelans want a negotiated settlement and fresh elections. Previous attempts at talks between Venezuela’s political players failed due largely to bad faith on the government’s side. International engagement must take the form of considered action to support Venezuelans inside and outside the country, not crude and dangerous interventions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f481e3b0a3af56a77d26e211b95bf53b7bfeb8f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d86608d7c246a7d98f6fc9125b55507","title":"brexit britain europe european article 50","story":"An old New Yorker cartoon shows a middle-aged man at a drinks party saying to another: “But that’s enough about you, let’s talk about me!” This is Brexit Britain talking to the rest of Europe. To be sure, all nations are obsessed with their own affairs. A Polish joke has it that the entry for elephant in the encyclopedia reads “the elephant and the Polish question”. But most European countries have at least some accompanying sensitivity to what is going on around them.I wonder how many people in Westminster this week even knew that the leaders of France and Germany were signing a new treaty of cooperation in Aachen that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, deeply shaken by the level of support for the gilets jaunes protests, had launched a “national debate”, much like the one being called for in Britain that Poland had been shaken by the senseless murder of the liberal, pro-European mayor of Gdańsk, Paweł Adamowicz, in an atmosphere of partisan conflict so bitter that the nation could not even unite in the face of such tragedy. Reflecting all this turmoil, the whole continent is gearing up for European elections in May which will be a battle royal between two fundamentally different visions of the European future – a conservative, nationalist one spearheaded by the Hungarian Viktor Orbán and the Italian Matteo Salvini, and a more liberal, internationalist one represented by the much weakened Aachen duo of Macron and Angela Merkel. Orbán and Salvini don’t intend to leave the EU, they intend to run it. So it’s not just the future of the UK that will be decided this year, it’s also the future of Europe.This is the background against which our European partners are appealing to the UK, with a mixture of exasperation and desperation, to tell them what it wants. Because of Theresa May’s incompetent intransigence, the immediate choice before the country is “no-deal Brexit or delay”. There is only one responsible answer.Fortunately, there are enough people in parliament, supported by numerous inidual members of the government, who recognise that we can’t go on like this. If two key amendments tabled with cross-party support are passed next week, parliament itself will be able to take the initiative in debates about Brexit every Tuesday – and if no way forward has been found by the end of February, the government will be instructed to seek an extension of article 50.Before formulating the request for an extension, however, politicians would do well to stop for a moment and – unlike the man at the drinks party – look at it from the other’s point of view. If the UK is constrained by its laws and politics, so is the EU27. The key legal problem is those elections to the European parliament. European law says that the new parliament cannot legally convene on 2 July unless there are properly elected representatives from all the member states. If the UK remains a member state, but does not hold European elections, everything the new parliament does would be vulnerable to legal challenge.Behind the legal problem is the politics. Some people in the EU really want the UK to leave, and would be happy to use this issue as a justification for pushing the recalcitrant Brits out of the door. Many more would in principle like the UK to stay, but are completely exasperated with London’s shillyshallying and feel it is more important for the rest of the EU to get on with saving itself. Then there are those who really want us to stay, including the likely next chancellor of Germany, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (aka AKK) and other leading German figures who recently conveyed that message in an extraordinary, heartfelt letter to the Times. But they, too, are impatient for the UK to say what it wants. Specifically, as the European commissioner Pierre Moscovici puts it, the EU needs a “reasoned request” for extending article 50.Now here’s the rub. Most EU sources agree that it would be relatively straightforward to get an extension until 1 July (thus not significantly affecting the new European parliament). Those extra three months might be sufficient for the UK parliament to agree some tweaked version of May’s deal, or to put the goal of a softer Brexit (somewhere between permanent customs union and Norway plus) into the political declaration. They are nothing like enough to have the national debate we need and then hold a carefully prepared second referendum. Moreover, it is not until after the European elections, the appointment of four top people in the EU (the new presidents of the European council, European commission, European parliament and European Central Bank), and quite possibly the emergence of Kramp-Karrenbauer as head of a new German government, that we will have a clearer idea of what kind of EU it is we will finally be deciding to stay in or leave.For clarity on both the British and the European side, we need another year, until 29 March 2020. Yes, I already hear a collective groan echoing from Durham to Delphi – but seriously, what’s a year when a century is at stake?The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.\u0026nbspThat committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no ergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026nbspBut it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\u0026nbspThe problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.\u0026nbspThe backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.\u0026nbspThe new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.\u0026nbspBut an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.\u0026nbspThe Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is\u0026nbsp a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspExtending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.\u0026nbspStaying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the\u0026nbspEuropean court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.\u0026nbspSince the May government (insofar as it still exists) will not prepare such a reasoned request, we on what I call the 3Rs side of the argument – the 3Rs being referendum, remain and reform – should do it ourselves. Some of our well-qualified lawyers and former officials should explore informally with European colleagues possible legal solutions to the genuinely knotty problem of the European parliament after 1 July. As important, our politicians should take a closer look at a continent in which everyone is facing challenges that have many of the same causes as the Brexit vote, and try to put our reasoned request in that wider European frame.One of Britain’s chronic problems in Europe is that while there have been many pro-European British politicians, there have been far fewer who actually speak European, in the way that French and Germans, Poles, Spaniards and Italians instinctively do. For they start with both head and heart from the premise of a shared future. Even from pro-European British mouths, the phrase “remain and reform” can all too easily sound like “you must reform so we can remain”. The burden of our song should be the other way round, “we must remain so together we can reform an EU that needs it to survive and prosper”. That melody at least has a sporting chance of finding some sympathetic ears.If we Brits are to get the time we need for the biggest political decision of our lives, we must speak not just plain English but also elementary European.• Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and  columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc4c6c98ab14f76e10c5f90c4ec6bf5762e725a/0_549_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947eb6c932f4e9a7a6ea9967ccaff401","title":"hardline brexiter history leavers britain","story":"Too many prominent leavers are not in fact patriots, but nurse a hatred of Britain as it really isThe decision of his enemy “could not be reconciled with reason,” once mused a great statesman. “I felt sure she would be ruined for a generation by such a plunge, and this proved true. But governments and peoples do not always take rational decisions. Sometimes they take mad decisions. Or one set of people get control, who compel all others to obey and aid them in folly.”Any takers, Balliol College, Oxford? No? It’s Winston Churchill, considering why Japan, already mired in an unwinnable campaign in China, would “court destruction” by going to war with Britain and the US in 1941. “I have not hesitated to record repeatedly my disbelief that Japan would go mad,” Boris Johnson’s idol wrote in his history of the second world war. “However sincerely we try to put ourselves in someone else’s position, we cannot allow for processes of the human mind and imagination to which reason offers no key.”I came across this fun insight while trying to take my mind off Brexit, by doing a spot of ironing to Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History podcast about the Asia-Pacific war of 1937-1945. But Brexit has a habit of worming its way back into your brain: the Baby Shark song of constitutional crises. I’m not saying that the pickle Britain is in is comparable to the situation in Japan in 1941. I can’t quite see Jacob Rees-Mogg masterminding a scheme to catch the Belgian fleet at port, and the ensuing chain of events leading to a multiple-front war, ending with the nuclear annihilation of Sheffield and Bristol.Another is that a conviction that you will prevail because your country is uniquely amazing (quite strong in Japan in 1941, I understand) is no protection against catastrophe. Indeed, it is much more likely to lead you towards it. This is a point that seems lost on leavers – history fans though they profess to be. Many have invoked our great imperial past as something we were destined to return to post-Brexit. In the giddy aftermath of the vote, Andrew Roberts thought that “one of the many splendid opportunities” offered by Brexit was the resuscitation of Churchill’s dream of a CANZUK union, comprising Canada, Australia, New Zealand and us. There was talk of Empire 2.0.These days, the vibe is more “let them eat turnips” Britain as underdog as opposed to would-be oppressor. However, a nasty strain of exceptionalism remains the default mode of the Brexit elite, usually abetted by a woeful misunderstanding of the qualities that have actually helped the British people in the past.Earlier this week, the pro-crashing-out economist Roger Bootle told the Bruges Group that the reason Britain could never make its peace with the EU was that we are one of only four European countries not to have endured occupation or dictatorship this last century. How conveniently he forgets that Ireland and Malta have indeed spent much of their history under occupation – British occupation. And how cleverly he reframes geography as a matter of virtue rather than luck. An old trick of the ruling classes, to confuse virtue and luck.It is not healthy patriotism that underpins that leave project but its toxic inversion: a hatred of Britain as it actually is, a contempt for its young, a dismissal of its businesses and an eagerness to make the poorest pay. Brexit hardliners are invariably the ones with dubious links to overseas pressure groups, with asset funds in emerging markets, with schemes to move their HQs abroad. The British reputation for pragmatism, good business sense and moderation is not some God-given destiny it required some active application of the same qualities. It required some sense of responsibility towards the next generation. These are supposedly conservative values, but they were sold off a long time ago, the proceeds half-forgotten in a vault in the Cayman Islands.Sadly, collective insanity isn’t necessarily a vulnerability in one’s opponents. Churchill again: “Madness is, however, an affliction which in war carries with it the advantage of surprise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21a0b521ad59a847a29f361eba56c1581443ab65/451_161_3074_1844/master/3074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08823ed3fb3285f68d341d7b24f4a1fa","title":"thai film maker wins uk contemporary art prize artes mundi","story":"Apichatpong Weerasethakul to receive £40,000 for his political artwork InvisibilityThe Palme d’Or winning film director and artist Apichatpong Weerasethakul has won one of the UK’s most important and lucrative contemporary art prizes.On Thursday evening, Weerasethakul was named winner of the eighth edition of the Artes Mundi prize, a biennial competition rewarding political art from across the world. It comes with a prize of £40,000, the largest visual art prize in Britain.The Thai artist is best known as a feature film maker, winning the top prize at the Cannes film festival in 2010 for his mysterious, contemplative film Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives.Weerasethakul’s work often explores the contradictions in Thailand between the country’s welcoming capitalist modernity and the often brutal, repressive military regime.His work is often described as oblique and that is arguably the case with his 12-minute film, Invisibility, on display at the National Museum Cardiff as part of the Artes Mundi prize exhibition. It has darkness and snatches of shadowy film and text that Weerasethakul hopes people will see as dream-like. At one point the text reads “This film is called Invisibility. A proposal for camouflage.”The judges praised Weerasethakul’s gallery work for its vigorous interrogation “of filmmaking, storytelling and the political and social position of the artist”. They added: “When times are tough it is sometimes not safe to talk about politics explicitly and Apichatpong Weerasethakul provides us with some subtle tools of resistance: the methodology of camouflage demonstrated in Invisibility is a powerful weapon in these turbulent times.”Artes Mundi was founded in 2002 to recognise and support contemporary artists who “engage with the human condition, social reality and lived experience”.Previous winners include the British artist John Akomfrah, American Theaster Gates and in 2012 the Mexican artist Teresa Margolles whose work shone light on Mexico’s horrific drug-related violence.Weerasethakul was named winner from a shortlist that also included Anna Boghiguian (CanadaEgypt), Bouchra Khalili (MoroccoFrance), Otobong Nkanga (NigeriaBelgium) and Trevor Paglen (USA)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eab3648cb303b1bc6160a2ca63fdf33aa2d9a63/0_374_5559_3336/master/5559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=333a7c74fe8f4c796aa0dfdb69c56ecf","title":"my toxic supervisor ruined my health but my university did nothing","story":"My supervisor was a known bully but when I reported his behaviour to my university, he received a promotion I arrived in the UK with a highly skilled work visa and a prestigious European grant. I thought I had hit the jackpot: my contract guaranteed enough money to pay the bills and fund high-quality research, my supervisor was a big name in the field, and my project would allow me to pursue big ideas and make a difference.But that’s not how things turned out. The superstar supervisor turned out to represent everything wrong with academia. During one of our first meetings, he made clear that although my contract allocated a certain number of annual leave days each year, I shouldn’t use them. During one six-month stretch I didn’t have a single day off, not even weekends or Christmas. Ninety-hour weeks were the norm, and Friday and Saturday nights were primetime. Once, the superstar called me on a Friday night demanding that I retrieve a document he had forgotten and deliver it to him at home. When I asked permission for a Thursday and a Friday off to visit family, he refused. I left on Friday anyway – and got hell for it.The superstar was publicly magnanimous but privately wretched to everyone who crossed his path. When he showed signs of this early on, disparaging colleagues and tearing his PhD students to pieces, I chalked it up to his arrogant personality. I ignored his cruel actions, shuddering – but doing nothing – as he sabotaged one PhD student’s field research and another’s involvement in international policy. When he launched a devious scheme to upturn his own denied promotion, I learned how one could circumvent merit with shrewd politics. He delivered all his hostility untraceably – as he said, never put into writing anything they can use against you.I said nothing and did nothing: what effect would it have wrought on me? But sooner or later, it was my turn. Every day, he made certain that his abuse arrived to me, in person, by phone or by thickly coded email. He chopped my research visits into impossibly short stints. One host asked why, and when I told him, he replied: “You can tell he does his research from 5,000 kilometres away.”It came to a head when he manipulated my research and authorship privilege one too many times. I wrote several book chapters and journal articles in his name that he withdrew either after falling out with the publications’ coordinators, or because he wanted to teach me a lesson. My health suffered terribly from the stress. Finally, I approached the head of the department and asked to work under someone else. If that were impossible, I said I would leave. The superstar threw a fit: if he could not own me, he would do everything in his power to see me disgraced. So I finished my contract remotely, plagued by serious health problems.Meanwhile, the superstar supervisor got promoted.When I learned of Britain’s growing interest in putting a halt to bullying in academia and promoting “dignity at work”, I compiled a detailed complaint and submitted it to the university’s HR department. It could have no impact on me, but I hoped that it might serve as on-hand support for the next casualty. Instead, it ran into a brick wall: the policies of the corporate university merely pay lip service to employment rights, and have little to do with the way things actually work. I have yet to settle on what bothers me more: my supervisor’s perverted behaviour and ethics, or the university’s tacit support of them. Both problems extend far beyond me, my supervisor, and my university, and illustrate how toxic research culture can be. Policies are nice for sticking in the legal files, but researchers work under a different university policy: the real one.Some details have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dcc58b2922de4a5b130e3240343d9ce66ed42fc/0_0_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1be9950b29b242dfb5363761b0e1bd4","title":"universities pressure selling place offers to school leavers","story":"Regulator warns rising use of ‘conditional unconditional offers’ may break consumer lawUniversities in England making “indiscriminate” unconditional offers to potential students may fall foul of consumer legislation against “pressure selling”, the sector’s regulator warned as it launched a consultation on admissions.The Office for Students (OfS) said it was particularly concerned at the growth of so-called “conditional unconditional offers” in recent years, which see universities giving students guaranteed places only if they name that university as their first choice.“So-called pressure selling tactics – for example, applying psychological pressure, or creating an impression of urgency in decision making – could be a potential breach of consumer protection law,” the OfS said in a report into the effects of separating offers from A-level grades.“We will make clear where ‘pressure selling’ practices are at risk of breaching consumer law, and empower students to challenge this as well as taking regulatory action ourselves if appropriate.”The comments came as the regulator published its own research into the upsurge in unconditional offers made by universities in England, which have risen sharply since the government removed the institutional cap on undergraduate places four years ago. According to the OfS, the number of offers with an unconditional component made to school-leavers rose from 3,000 in 2013 to 117,000 in 2018.Figures published by the Ucas admissions service last month showed that one in three 18-year-olds applying for university places in England, Wales and Northern Ireland this year received some form of unconditional offer. The OfS’s remit only extends to higher education in England.The use of the offers – instead of conditional offers that require applicants to achieve specific A-level or other exam results – have been criticised by schools for removing the incentive for pupils to achieve their best performance. But some universities say it helps integrate potential students earlier in the process, as while as lessening stress.The OfS’s research said there was as yet no statistically significant difference in drop-out rates between school-leavers admitted with unconditional offers and those who entered with conditional offers. But it did suggest that around 1,000 sixth formers in one year had lower than expected A-level grades as a result of accepting unconditional offers.The explosion in unconditional offers has led to calls, most recently by the Universities and Colleges Union, for an overhaul of the university admissions system so that students applied after receiving their exam results, and so do away with conditional and unconditional offers.Nicola Dandridge, the OfS’s chief executive, said the issue raised wider questions about whether the admissions system could cope with “an era of intense competition” between universities.“On this question, the OfS will bring together a range of parties – including the Department for Education, Ucas, students, higher education providers, schools and employers - to consult on how the admissions system can best achieve the goal of providing every student with a fulfilling experience of higher education,” Dandridge said.Damian Hinds, the education secretary for England, said he was disturb by the steep rise in the use of unconditional offers.“I believe that widespread use of these offers is not in the best interests of students, who should be encouraged to reach their full potential,” Hinds said.“I am urging universities to use their offers responsibly and not just use unconditional offers to get students through the door. Where institutions cannot justify the rising numbers being offered I have made clear to the Office for Students that they should use the full range of powers at their disposal to take action.”The OfS said that students from disadvantaged backgrounds were more likely to receive unconditional offers, but said it was because they were more likely to apply to universities that made them, rather than being deliberately targeted.“If we identify cases where unconditional offers are having an obvious negative impact on students’ choices or outcomes, we are of course prepared to intervene,” Dandridge said.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said it was “deeply concerning” to see the surge in unconditional offers, with disadvantaged young people the most likely to be affected. “It’s clear that the Tories’ free market experiment in higher education is failing students,” Rayner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6ed9122d4c468be285a7a5e8aeb0553d062bbee/286_186_2065_1240/master/2065.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0621425b3bc0f9a98b869b94e72b6c8d","title":"bye bye blackbird rspbs big garden birdwatch marks 40 years","story":"World’s biggest wildlife citizen survey maps changing fortunes of Britain’s bird populationsThe garden of 1979 was filled with glossy gangs of starlings, the atonal chirp of sparrows and the tap-tap of song thrushes breaking open snail shells.In 2019, you’re more likely to hear the screech of a ring-necked parakeet, the “coo” of a collared dove or the “woo” of a woodpigeon.The Big Garden Birdwatch is marking its 40th year this weekend, with half a million people expected to spend an hour counting the birds in their garden or local green space in what is the world’s biggest wildlife citizen science project.The 130 million bird sighting records have charted the rise of ring-necked parakeets across London and the south-east, and the resurgence of the reintroduced red kite – people are allowed to record this big bird of prey if it is seen flying over their garden rather than in it.Mike Clarke, RSPB chief executive, said: “Everyone has a role to play in saving nature and protecting our wildlife. Big Garden Birdwatch participants have made a significant contribution to monitoring garden bird numbers over the past four decades.“It’s an enjoyable, easy, inclusive activity that anyone can do and a great opportunity to connect with nature.”While many of the population trends are caused by forces beyond gardeners’ control, including climate change and an intensification of farming, people can make their backyards and green spaces more bird-friendly. The RSPB recommends keeping gardens chemical-free, allowing bushes and thick hedges to grow, and providing bird food, water and north or east-facing nest boxes.Participants are asked to spend an hour on Saturday, Sunday or Monday recording their local birds and sending the results to the RSPB.

This natural climate variation causes warm and dry conditions in the tropics, meaning the plant growth that removes CO2 from the air is restricted.Levels of the greenhouse gas have not been as high as today for 3-5m years, when the global temperature was 2-3C warmer and the sea level was 10-20 metres higher. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C rise above pre-industrial levels that scientists advise, according to the UN. But the past four years have been the hottest on record and global emissions are rising again after a brief pause.“Looking at the monthly figures, it’s as if you can see the planet ‘breathing’ as the levels of CO2 fall and rise with the seasonal cycle of plant growth and decay in the northern hemisphere,” said Prof Richard Betts, at the Met Office’s Hadley Centre. “The graph is a thing of beauty, but also a stark reminder of human impact on climate. Each year’s CO2 is higher than the last, and this will keep happening until humans stop adding CO2 to the atmosphere.”“This news is worrying and compelling,” said Prof Nick Ostle, at Lancaster University. “It represents a call to innovate with rapid and radical responses to offset these growing emissions.” He said cuts in fossil fuel use, deforestation and emissions from livestock were needed: “It’s a massive challenge but there are real opportunities to make an impact inidually and globally.”The Met Office has a good record of forecasting global CO2 levels and predicts that the average rise over 2019 will be 2.75 parts per million (ppm). That would put it among the highest annual rises in the 62 years since good records began.Only years with strong El Niño events, 1998 and 2016, are likely to be higher. The rise in 2016 was 3.39ppm. In the decade after the first measurement on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa in 1956, annual rises were less than 0.9ppm per year.An El Niño event occurs when the tropical Pacific swings into a warm phase, causing many regions to have warmer and drier weather. Trees and plants are natural carbon sinks because they absorb CO2 as they grow, but this is reduced in El Niño years.“This year we expect these carbon sinks to be relatively weak, so the impact of record high human-caused emissions will be larger than last year,” said Betts.The Met Office forecasts an average CO2 level in 2019 of 411ppm. Monthly averages are expected to peak at 415ppm in May, before the growing season temporarily reduces levels to 408ppm in September, when CO2 will begin rising once again. The level of CO2 in the atmosphere before the industrial revolution sparked the large-scale burning of coal, oil and gas was 280ppm.“It never rains but it pours,” said Prof Dave Reay, at the University of Edinburgh. “Our own CO2 emissions are still increasing, and now the world’s natural carbon sinks are set for a bad year too. We know these sinks have been mopping up around half of all our emissions to date. We can only hope their faltering in 2019 is just a short-term blip, as without their help any chance of a safer climate future will turn to dust.”Prof Jos Barlow, also at Lancaster University, said the rising destruction of forests is serious concern: “This has been a particularly bad year. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased to around 8,000 square kilometres in 2018, which is equivalent to losing a football pitch of forest every 30 seconds. There are also worrying signs that deforestation is occurring at a faster rate in other Amazonian countries, such as Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1dde463555c33832ac00fc34b6984c04b4ac349/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1140\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a9725b549a5f862824f492fa5c368c32 2280w","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

David Luiz had scored the decisive penalty. The players of Tottenham were on their knees and it will be Maurizio Sarri’s team who will be trying to face down Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final.Over the two legs, they will feel they deserved nothing less. Chelsea certainly responded with great vigour to Sarri’s criticism after their defeat by Arsenal on Saturday. They led 2-0 at half-time only for Fernando Llorente’s goal to take the game to its dramatic finale, when it boiled down to which group of players could hold their nerve from 12 yards.Christian Eriksen went first for Spurs and put his shot into the bottom right-hand corner of Kepa Arrizabalaga’s net. Érik Lamela, the team’s next penalty-taker, went to the other side and beat Chelsea’s goalkeeper again. Yet Willian, with a feinting run, had scored for Chelsea in between. César Azpilicueta’s effort was a beauty, picking out the top corner after a long run-up, and then it was Eric Dier breaking free from the line of Spurs players to start the long walk from the centre-circle, hoping for some of the joy he encountered during England’s penalty shootout against Colombia in the World Cup.Dier’s decisive penalty in Moscow was not particularly well taken. It was better, however, than the one he hit over the crossbar here and Chelsea never looked back once they had that advantage. Jorginho rolled in their next penalty, with an unorthodox little skip, and when Luca Moura’s kick was saved that cleared the way for David Luiz to confirm Chelsea’s place at Wembley on 24 February, by which time Gonzalo Higuaín, ineligible to make his debut against Spurs, should be fully integrated into a team who on this evidence, can take criticism from their manager better than many people anticipated.Against Arsenal, Sarri thought his players had lacked conviction and did not have the strength of personality to do anything about it. Yet the idea Chelsea could be so passive in this semi-final, given all their conflict with Spurs over recent years, was never realistic. David Luiz played through pain for most of the match after taking an early bang from Dier. Or just consider, perhaps, the moment when N’Golo Kanté’s low, spinning shot went through the legs of Moussa Sissoko to deceive the Spurs goalkeeper, Paulo Gazzaniga, to make it 1-1 on aggregate.There was no pumping of fists from the scorer. His teammates were rushing to embrace him but he was looking past them all. Kanté was pointing to the ball, making the point that he wanted someone to retrieve it – and quickly. He wanted the game to restart, with Spurs in retreat, and in those moments it felt almost like a trick of the imagination that Sarri could question the competitive courage of his players.Along the way, Eden Hazard might feel he proved his point, too. Sarri is right if he considers Hazard is not the classic leader, in terms of rolling up his sleeves, the old-fashioned way, and rousing his teammates, John Terry-style. There are different forms of leadership, however, and Hazard’s performance was a reminder why he is still the player who carries Chelsea’s greatest hopes.Playing on the left, with a licence to roam, he was in his strongest position, eluding opponents, cutting infield and making it his business to get into the penalty area. For Chelsea’s second goal, the ball went left to right, from Hazard to Pedro and then the overlapping Azpilicueta. The cross came in low and Hazard made an awkward shot look easy to give Chelsea an aggregate lead for the first time.For Spurs, that opening 45 minutes was an ordeal and a stark reminder about their reduction in performance when Harry Kane is missing from Mauricio Pochettino’s side. Dele Alli and Son Heung-min were other absentees and there can be no doubt Chelsea, trying to claw back a 1-0 first-leg deficit, must have been encouraged by the fact their opponents were deprived of key performers, especially when Pochettino had also left out Hugo Lloris, his first-choice goalkeeper. Spurs could have done with Kane, in particular, during the penalties.Spurs still had the incentive of trying to rid themselves of the one thing that is always held against them: that they have never won a trophy in the Pochettino era. It made for a compelling match, two of the Premier League’s leading sides slugging it out, under the floodlights, with the volume turned high and the underlying sense, in the stands and on the pitch, that these teams and their supporters are really not too fond of one another.Spurs were reeling until, five minutes into the second half, Llorente’s goal changed the complexion. Danny Rose, who had replaced the injured Ben Davies, supplied the cross from the left. Llorente had David Luiz in proximity but the Brazilian’s body position was entirely wrong. Llorente kept his eyes on the ball, six yards out, and headed in the goal that levelled the match again.After that, both sides went hunting for a winner and, for the first time, Spurs threatened to get on top. Giroud could have restored Chelsea’s lead within a minute and put a header wide in stoppage time. Hazard, of all people, squandered another decent opportunity but, with Spurs becoming increasingly dangerous, Llorente wasted a good chance from Eriksen’s brilliant right-sided delivery. Llorente apologised to Pochettino when he was substituted and, once again, Tottenham were left to reflect on what could have been."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4bb90dc8b2d31d222f6f4d0595a432e4a4caba8/295_63_1349_809/master/1349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b69b2d1d4f7c0f6051bc6497386fce44","title":"thierry henry suspended monaco manager 104 days","story":"Thierry Henry has been suspended by Monaco three months after his appointment as manager. They have won only two league games under the former Arsenal striker and are 19th in Ligue 1. The club said a final decision was pending and that Franck Passi, who arrived last month to provide experienced assistance for Henry, will oversee Friday’s training session.It has been a troubled spell for Henry, who walked into a relegation battle when he replaced Leonardo Jardim on 13 October. At that point Monaco were 18th but their fortunes have not improved during a 104-day, 20-match stint and his frustrations rose to the surface in the buildup to Saturday’s game against Dijon, who are one place above them.Henry said his team were “going to war” in their effort to arrest a five-game winless run in the league and suggested an attitude problem within the squad. “We need guys who want to save the club, who don’t think about themselves,” he said. Asked who would be left out at Dijon, he replied: “You will see. There are too many names.”Monaco had shown signs of life after Christmas, a penalty shootout win over Rennes in the League Cup preceding draws at Marseille and at home to Patrick Vieira’s Nice on 16 January. After the latter, Henry observed that Monaco, who have been undermined by big-name departures and a lengthy injury list, were beginning to play the way he wanted. Henry’s former Arsenal teammate, Cesc Fàbregas, was tempted to join from Chelsea and the outlook appeared brighter.But they took another step backwards with a 5-1 home defeat to Strasbourg last Saturday, playing 83 minutes with 10 men, and were defeated 3-1 at Stade Louis II by Ligue 2 side Metz in the French Cup on Tuesday. That appears to have pressed Monaco into action, with reports suggesting Jardim could make an unlikely return should Henry’s exit be confirmed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be82f864eba131e051298e8e77e6b26763d7fa93/0_204_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b47a109445a1b9a0dde1fcd99a405606","title":"football transfer rumours juan mata arsenal free transfer","story":"Today’s rumours are giving you a run for your moneyThe Mill is up bright and early, licking its lips ahead of a huge showdown between Arsenal and Manchester United later on. Who will come out on top in the tug-of-war for Juan Mata? To be fair, there’s little indication United are pulling especially hard: Mata’s contract runs out in the summer and there’s been scant progress on a new deal, so let the games commence. The Gunners believe Mata won’t be put off by the underwhelming fortunes of recent transfers – in either direction – between the two, but they have Juventus, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain for company and, of course, need to face him and his team-mates in an actual football match this evening.Anyone awaiting a real blockbuster signing at the Emirates this winter may be waiting … a while. There’ll be no Andrey Arshavin in the snow this year but there could be a loan move for Paris Saint-Germain’s versatile Christopher Nkunku, a 21-year-old midfielder who can also fill in up and down the right-hand side. Arsenal will turn to him if their long-running pursuit of Barcelona’s Denis Suárez falls flat, with the Catalan club playing hardball over a permanent deal. Sevilla or Real Betis could be Suárez’s next destination. In the meantime it’s scraps from the cupboard in N5 at the moment.Talking of scraps – albeit of a different stripe – connoisseurs of uncompromising, brick-outhouse defending in the Uruguayan mould will be curious to see that Diego Godin is set to end his long spell with Atlético Madrid and join Inter Milan in the summer.Barcelona’s winter dealings have the feeling of an alien trying a little too hard to blend in with us mere earthlings.

He could be freed up be Manchester City if Pep Guardiola can snaffle Ajax’s supremely talented Matthijs de Ligt. Next up for Barça? Presumably Scott Arfield and Sol Bamba.Next up for City, though, could be a raid of Spain’s other big power. David Silva is getting on a bit, so what harm another midfielder with silky technique and a low centre of gravity? That man might be Isco, who is out of favour under Real Madrid head honcho Santiago Solari and could depart in the summer if the status quo remains.In more assiduous planning for pre-season, Liverpool will apparently find their names inserted in a brand new contract for the RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner – allowing them, along with nine other unspecified clubs, to take him for £61m if he signs the deal. Somebody who won’t be arranging tours to the far east this summer, though, is Thierry Henry. As trailed yesterday, he’s been shown the door by Monaco and looks set to be replaced by the man he … erm … replaced, Leonardo Jardim. His old chum Patrick Vieira has problems of his own at Nice: Cardiff want to sign his defensive midfielder Adrien Tameze and have had a bid rejected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf32f96c813ce0fff223d1f932b050b7809cce0a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a8dbc1295518e80ec1e1b7b10c9f436","title":"fa cup fourth round 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Cue up the 1999 footage before Friday night at the Emirates, plus Accrington, Newport and Shrewsbury all eye upsetsThe difference between victory and defeat on Manchester United’s last trip to London, their 1-0 sneak past Tottenham at Wembley, was goalkeeper David de Gea’s stunning performance but he did not board the first-class train carriage taking Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s team to the capital. Instead, Sergio Romero will don the gloves with Lee Grant as reserve. Despite Romero being the Argentinian national team’s long-term first-choice, De Gea’s absence surely lifts Arsenal’s expectations. Solskjær has displayed old-school values since taking over, won the FA Cup twice with United, and started that legendary 1999 semi-final replay against Arsenal, but modern practice dictates reserve goalies getting their chance in the competition. Barring Unai Emery deciding to rotate out his leading strikers, that spells opportunity for Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. JBExcept for anyone who took part in or spied on Derby County’s training this week, no one knows exactly what sort of shape 38-year-old Ashley Cole is in these days. But we may get some insight this Saturday, when the best English player of his generation could play for his new club against Accrington Stanley. While it would be wonderful to see Cole close to his best, the right and proper thing to hope for is a dramatic victory for the League One side, who, thanks to victories in previous rounds against Colchester, Cheltenham and Ipswich, have a chance to advance to the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time in their history. Accrington operate in a different world to your Coles and your Frank Lampards – the £180,000 in prize money they would get for beating Derby would surpass their entire season-ticket revenue – and the scenes of joy that would accompany a home win on Saturday would be priceless. PDIt’s deja vu all over again as Manchester City meet Burnley in the FA Cup at the Etihad for the second season in succession. Last year, the sides met in the third round and City ran out easy winners despite going behind. At the time Burnley were seventh in the Premier League while their opponents were coasting towards an easy title win. A little over a year on and much has changed: Pep Guardiola’s men are playing catch-up against a Liverpool team currently enjoying a sunshine break, while Sean Dyche’s squad are fighting for their Premier League lives. While both men treated last year’s FA Cup tie with the utmost seriousness, circumstance and necessity suggest they may not do so on Saturday. BGNow Manuel Pellegrini has shown Marko Arnautovic that no inidual is bigger than the team, the next task for West Ham’s manager is to restore the Austrian’s hunger. Arnautovic’s attempts to force through a move to China have been an unwelcome distraction for West Ham and there are no guarantees the 29-year-old will knuckle down after being dropped against Bournemouth last weekend. While the forward is in contention to feature against AFC Wimbledon on Saturday night, it remains to be seen if strong and decisive management from Pellegrini will draw the right reaction from a seasoned professional whose dismay at being denied a transfer left him unable to play a Premier League game. He could return with a point to prove or could just leave Pellegrini thinking he should have taken the money by sulking for the rest of the season. Only one thing is certain: West Ham need a motivated Arnautovic after witnessing the very worst of Andy Carroll against Bournemouth. JSFollowing their victory over Liverpool, Wolves travel to New Meadow on what promises to be a bumper payday for Shrewsbury Town. Currently 18th in the third tier, they are managed by Sam Ricketts, who will attempt to mastermind a famous victory over the club he skippered to the League One title in 2014. Ricketts has already made plenty of headlines in this year’s competition, having first been told to stay away from Wrexham’s defeat at the hands of Newport County after being approached by the Shrews while still manager of the Welsh club. Upon taking up his new role, he watched from the technical area as they came from 2-0 down to dispatch Stoke City in a third-round replay. With former Wolves and Wales teammate Dave Edwards now on his playing staff but nursing a minor groin injury, Ricketts has a big decision to make. A player with Wolves for nine years, Edwards is desperate to be involved on Saturday but for his manager it could be a case of ruling with his head rather than his heart. BGWhile Millwall are battling to stay in the Championship, it would be a mistake for Everton to underestimate Neil Harris’s side. The south Londoners have been on a good run since the festive period and will relish the opportunity to make an evening at the Den as uncomfortable as possible for their Premier League opponents, just as they did when they knocked Bournemouth and Leicester out of the FA Cup two years ago. The banana-skin potential is high. It will be loud and intimidating and Everton will be in trouble if they start with the wrong attitude. Marco Silva, who is under scrutiny after a few disappointing results and toothless displays, must make sure his stars understand what Millwall are about. JSIt might look like Newcastle have had Watford’s number this season – they beat Javi Gracia’s team at St James’ Park in November and then held them to a draw at Vicarage Road the following month – but a key feature of each of those games was Watford’s wastefulness. Gerard Deulofeu was the main culprit, repeatedly goofing in front of goal in both matches. If he plays on Saturday, he can expect to get opportunities to atone because Watford are the better team, much happier and far more likely than Newcastle to win a trophy in the foreseeable future, facts that are always worth mentioning to anyone who whines about the nefarious influence of foreign owners in English football. PDHaving been thrashed 4-1 at home by Preston last weekend, QPR will hope to avoid further embarrassment on Saturday when League One leaders Portsmouth visit Loftus Road. While Steve McClaren may well give fringe players such as Matt Ingram, Osman Kakay and Bright Osayi-Samuel a game, the QPR player fans would probably most like to see lining up against Pompey is Grant Hall. The defender, once a first-team staple, has completed 90 minutes just twice this season following a 2017 diagnosis of tendonitis which left him sidelined for the best part of two years. Hall has revealed the injury led to him struggling with a bout of depression he felt unable to talk about until QPR director of football Les Ferdinand pointed him in the right direction. The player received a rapturous welcome when he completed the duration of his side’s third-round win against Leeds. He has not played since but fitness permitting should start against Portsmouth. BGNewport County’s punishment for their third-round victory over Leicester City is a 540-mile round trip to the Riverside Stadium, where on Saturday they will take on a Middlesbrough side 56 places above them in the league. Having made almost £500,000 already from this year’s FA Cup, Michael Flynn’s men treated themselves to a night of luxury at The Belfry on Thursday and were due to train at St George’s Park before continuing their journey to Teesside. Despite this pampering, their players would almost certainly prefer to be playing at Rodney Parade, an inhospitable, hostile environment that both Tottenham and Leicester have struggled to deal with in the past year. Getting a result against whatever side Tony Pulis fields will be a tall order, but the prospect of a money-spinning home replay you’d give them every chance of winning will be all the motivation this battling Welsh side needs. BGBarnet are the only remaining non-league club in the FA Cup and their most recent match was a 4-0 king by Braintree Town, the worst team in the National League. But we should not read too much into a result skewed by a red card shown to their goalkeeper, Mark Cousins, in the third minute. Their form prior to that game was decent, with six wins in nine matches, including that splendid counterattacking triumph at Sheffield United in the third round. They will no doubt aim to do something similar against Brentford on Monday but the Championship side will arrive with ominous momentum. Thomas Frank struggled after replacing Dean Smith as head coach in October, mustering just four points from his first 10 matches in charge, but he has stabilised the side in recent weeks and they are unbeaten in their last seven matches. But has the balance been upset again by the sale of key defender Chris Mepham to Bournemouth? Barnet hope so.

In a conflict zone where rape is routinely used as a weapon of war, other girls were less fortunate that night. She was just 12.After fleeing into the forest, Marie and her relatives found their way several days later to Kaga-Bandoro, an impoverished town in wartorn Central African Republic (CAR) where a camp had been established for internally displaced people.But Marie’s ordeal was not over.One morning, she went to collect water just outside the camp. At the well, two gunmen cornered her. “They caught me and raped me. Afterwards, I had to see a doctor.” She pauses. “The rape had caused damage.”Encircled by hostile militants on all sides, this besieged camp is a threatening place, especially for children. Aid workers run makeshift classrooms to nurture some kind of hope for the future and teachers push a curriculum of forgiveness and unity. Under dusty tarpaulins sit dozens of pupils, including former child soldiers and young survivors of rape. At rickety wooden desks, they count, read and sing, continuing an education against the odds.“To break the cycle of violence, forgiveness is essential,” says Therese Aka, a child-protection specialist with the UN’s children’s agency, Unicef. “These children are crucial to rebuilding the country.”CAR’s war has no rules. Places that protect and support civilians – churches and mosques, schools and hospitals – are all targets. In Kaga -andoro, soldiers have ransacked the town’s only school repeatedly, looting tables, chairs, even doors.In NGO parlance, makeshift classrooms are dubbed “temporary learning spaces”. But for aid workers like Joslyn Sanzé, the phrase is misleading.“In reality, there’s nothing temporary about them,” says Sanzé, an education officer for Unicef. “People have been in this camp for so long. This is their home now.”In one of the most dangerous countries for humanitarians – who faced nearly 400 attacks last year – Sanzé is on a mission to help as many children as possible. But with up to 20,000 in this camp alone, and only a handful of tents, resources are at breaking point.Nationwide, violence has forced more than a million people – a quarter of CAR’s population – from their homes. Two-thirds of children are in urgent need of aid: 1.5 million in total, up from 1.2 million in 2016. The humanitarian response is chronically underfunded not once in the past three years has even half of the required support been obtained.“This war is creating a lost generation,” Sanzé tells . “These are children who have seen their own parents and teachers killed or attacked. When they arrive at this camp, they feel so lost. But here, they find new friendships and their hope is reborn.”Spotting a UN policeman enter a classroom, Sanzé moves off to ask the officer to leave his holstered gun would panic the children.Teachers – themselves uprooted by fighting – are hired to work in these classrooms, bolstering their sense of purpose despite the desolation.“These teachers are survivors,” says Sanzé. “They have lost everything but this work allows them to find themselves again.”One such survivor is Elizabeth Yaketé. Strict, no-nonsense and devoted to her profession, this primary school teacher fled into the bush five years ago when militants attacked her village and burned down her house. Today, in defiance of the dirt, danger and dire sanitation, her clothes are spotless each morning as she arrives at class from the camp’s labyrinth of huts.“Everyone has the capacity inside themselves to teach,” says Yaketé, in her early 50s. “All these children want peace and to return home. I teach them to forgive and to move on from what happened in their villages, not to take vengeance and kill even more people.”This relentless cycle of reprisals was set in motion by the outbreak of war in 2013. A largely Muslim alliance of rebels seized much of the country and toppled the government, atrocities triggering revenge attacks from predominantly Christian militias. A brief calm followed elections in 2016, but violence has returned as the rebel coalition disintegrates into rival factions.These groups fight over mineral resources and terrorise civilians with impunity, making life for children here more dangerous than ever. CAR’s government and the numerous rebel groups that collectively control most of the country are due to meet on Thursday in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, in a bid by the African Union to revive stalled peace talks.To the south, in Alindao, Amnesty International revealed in December, Blue Helmets deserted their posts as militants massacred up to 100 civilians. Investigators said UN soldiers retreated to their base as rebels fired artillery into a crowded camp, storming the site and torching homes. The many dead included women, children, the elderly and disabled people.Amid this maelstrom, Marie and thousands more like her battle on with their education.“This camp feels very strange,” she says. “It is not home. But I can’t leave because soldiers still live in my village. My studies are all I have.”Sanzé is equally determined to persevere, even in the face of such horrors. The next generation, he says, must not be abandoned.“If we give up now, my country will fall apart,” he says in Kaga Bandoro as morning classes end and children stream out of crowded tents in scorching heat. “We have to sacrifice ourselves for the sake of the country. Education is the foundation of everything in life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/196dadf9bc8178c4679be1104705c5664514aee0/0_106_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c2624c2120d01fd6f74b999e08d7e73","title":"balancing quality and performance audio advice for voice apps","story":"Tips on compression and the top audio formats for spoken word apps from  Voice Lab If you are a newcomer to working on audio within the sphere of voice, it can seem like there is a lot to learn about encoding and formats, but the truth is, a little bit of knowledge can get you a long way. Although Google’s audio format and compression recommendations are somewhat lacking, by heeding our advice and avoiding a couple of potential potholes we came across at the  Voice Lab, this article should keep you in good stead for managing audio on your future voice projects.Broadly speaking, audio enthusiasts have a passion for fidelity. In music production circles, for example, there is an almost perverse obsession with capturing and replicating performances or recordings as accurately as possible.To do this, you need formats that involve no compression at all. You might have heard of WAVs or AIFFs, which do just this. However, a byproduct of uncompressed audio is unwieldy, large files, as they have to capture huge amounts of information, much of which goes well beyond what our ears can hear, and beyond what most sound systems can hope to reproduce.Although they sound great, large files are slow to load, so within voice interactions – where even short delays can have detrimental effects on the conversational experience – what can be done to preserve rapid loading times? Reduced file sizes.Compression in theoryTo reduce audio file size, we need to apply compression, and there are two ways this can be done: lossless or lossy compression. For our beloved audio enthusiast friends, lossless compression formats such as FLAC (free lossless audio codec) allow those glorious original sounds to be stored in a smaller file, which when retrieved remain fully intact, in all their glory! A delight to our highly attuned and sophisticated audiophile friends’ ears!Compression in realityThe real-world challenges of bandwidth restrictions and a need for speed of audio delivery mean the audiophile’s iron grip over priorities begins to slip away when audio moves into the world of voice.This battle for audio quality appears futile when you consider the myriad devices upon which digital assistants are available, from the high-end headphones which can indeed replicate high quality sounds, through to the small speakers on smartphones, which certainly cannot.So, as lossless compression formats do not do quite enough in terms of file reduction, “lossy” formats go further. Familiar lossy file types such as MP3 and AAC shrink audio files to a far greater extent, but this time with compromises – as some of the information is lost for ever. Cue weeping audiophiles.By cleverly using auditory masking, which is where quiet sounds concurrent with loud sounds cannot be heard, and psychoacoustics, the branch of psychology concerned with the perception of sound, these compression modes look to only save information that we as listeners can and will notice, and not the stuff we will not.The popularity and proliferation of MP3 and other lossy formats reflect, in part, their extraordinary success in creating perceptively high-quality audio while maintaining small file sizes.At higher bitrates, most people cannot tell the difference. Can you?Not all formats are created equallyYet, with each format applying its own algorithmic strategy on how to create smaller files, it is only when you begin to reduce the amount of data a file holds per second – from the higher end 320kbps (kilobits per second), 192kbps and 128kbps bitrates of music encoding best practices, to the lower bitrates of 64kbps, 32kbps and even 24kbps recommended for voice – that noticeable acoustic artifacts begin to emerge. At this lower end, it becomes clear that not all lossy formats were created equally.When the Voice Lab looked at Google’s audio documentation while developing our first project, we were very surprised to see the guide recommends a bitrate of 24kbps for MP3 or Ogg Vorbis.We were surprised, firstly, by the extent to which Google prioritises small file sizes above all else, in recommending such a low bitrate as 24kbps. But secondly, surprised that by recommending MP3 or Ogg Vorbis at the same bitrate, Google appears to suggest these two formats offer a parity of quality when, in reality, they do not.Have a listen to the below video to get an idea of how dramatically different the two codecs of MP3 and Ogg Vorbis perform, even at 48kbps, double the bitrate recommended by Google. Ogg Vorbis comes out the undisputed winner, as it does at lower bitrates.Practicality of useIn terms of practical considerations, despite its inferior performance, the widespread proliferation of MP3 makes it the easier format to work with, as default audio players such as iTunes offer MP3 encoding options, allowing easy conversion of your WAVAIFF files.Using Ogg Vorbis requires a little more effort. For the Voice Lab to use Ogg Vorbis on our Year in Review project, we used a command line utility, FFmpeg, to script batch conversions of our uncompressed audio.Despite requiring an initial upfront effort in set-up, the script saved the team lots of time over the course of the project, and the gains in Ogg Vorbis audio quality were considerable and absolutely worth the effort.It comes as little surprise that Spotify favours encoding its music in Ogg Vorbis over MP3 for precisely this ability to maintain both audio quality and small file sizes.In conclusion, Google’s selection of 24kbps as its recommended bitrate for both MP3 and Ogg Vorbis reflects its focus for audio within voice to be on producing small files sizes for rapid playback, rather than higher fidelity and rich audio.However, by ensuring you do not assume Google’s recommendations for audio suggest parity between the formats, by implementing use of Ogg Vorbis over MP3, you can achieve higher audio quality standards while maintaining those small file sizes and high retrieval speeds that voice requires.Find out more about the Voice Lab’s mission or get in touch at voicelab@the."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd478d91f63710edbc14e166f95afc0d256b850a/0_91_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e57ad62edaaa91067366f7886da1790","title":"as huffpost and buzzfeed shed staff has the digital content bubble burst","story":"Fears are growing that current models of paying for online journalism are brokenIn 2005 a 31-year-old media studies graduate called Jonah Peretti helped to found an online news and comment website called the Huffington Post. A year later he started an experimental side project called BuzzFeed.The two sites would help create an online media boom, as investors rushed to buy stakes in the belief such outlets were more nimble and more in tune with the desires of readers who grew up on the internet rather than with traditional newspapers and broadcasters.On Wednesday, HuffPost’s parent company, Verizon Media Group, and BuzzFeed both announced plans to lay off hundreds of staff. The news signalled a collision between the dream of an online media boom and the accountants’ harsher reality: questions over the long-term profitability of digital media companies, and, as a result, concerns over the future of online journalism itself.“What if there is literally no profitable model for digital news? Or none that actually scales and endures without, say, the established readership base and brand of the New York Times?” asked the MSNBC presenter Chris Hayes, summarising a growing fear among media executives that the current model of paying for journalism on the internet is broken.The same news executives are coming to terms with the fact that, in the modern world of mobile consumption, most sites are just another form of distraction. Their competition is not just rival scoops – but a vast online ecosystem of entertaining, shareable and social content.“It’s clear that we have a digital content bubble,” said Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, the director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University. “There’s no question we’re going to see more cuts, both in legacy media and digital-born ones.”He said part of the issue was the investors who backed online media startups thought they were investing in fast-growing tech businesses, rather than something resembling a traditional news outlet.“In some ways, for journalism to succeed as a business it needs patient investors who are content with incremental growth and modest returns on investment.”This attitude fed into the financial culture of the companies, which often hired staff at breakneck speed. Online site Mic rented glitzy offices in the World Trade Center in New York, shortly before the company collapsed after last year’s changes to Facebook’s algorithm, which hit many online publishers’ traffic hard.BuzzFeed placed an emphasis on retaining employees by providing generous working conditions such as free lunches, featuring sushi and rock oysters. Vice was famed for the decadence of its parties under its former chief executive Shane Smith, who was in charge when the company was hit with accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct. Major online media companies, which are often referred to as startups – despite, in many cases, being more than a decade old – are now having to control costs. At the same time, they are being asked questions by investors who are wondering about the true value of their stake.BuzzFeed’s email announcing layoffs made it clear the company would not be seeking to raise any more funds, and the business appears to have abandoned its once-proposed plan to float on the stock exchange.This is despite the fact the company is hoping to record income of $300m in 2018 following doubt-digit revenue growth, while its UK edition is close to profitability – a performance that would delight many traditional outlets but is not enough for investors.Even as online media companies have fought off a slew of low-rent competitors mimicking their distribution methods, they have also had to contend with more established outlets learning from their skills in experimentation.In BuzzFeed’s early days, the company mastered the art of gaming Facebook’s algorithm by building lists and posts based around identity and entertainment issues, which would appeal to readers and encourage them to share. Suddenly, an established online brand could be matched by the use of an organic distribution network: readers themselves.The result was a run of posts which would reach millions of views, aided by carefully-studied insights – such as the fact that adding the word “actually” to a quiz headline could supercharge its traffic.Those insights helped to maximise viral reach, with an attention to detail and deep analysis of what prompted humans to share that sometimes belied their apparently frivolous content and headlines.Gradually, ongoing changes to Facebook’s algorithm eroded some of the competitive advantage in the field. BuzzFeed looked to develop its presence on other platforms and invest in the serious news journalism which saw it publish the Trump dossier and be shortlisted for a Pulitzer prize.At BuzzFeed, Peretti constantly suggested Facebook would be forced to pay for content, an outcome that has yet to materialise, before seeking to create TV-style programming for other companies. Last year he floated the eye-catching idea of a mega-merger of online media companies to take on Facebook and Google but sources at the company have played down the importance of this.He told staff on Wednesday they would look to ersify income away from the main website and hoped to be “clear winner in the market as the economics of digital media continue to improve”.Instead, there has been an unexpected swing back to big traditional outlets, with the likes of the New York Times seeing enormous demand for its subscriptions, at a time when newspapers are closing across the rest of the US. Some outlets are relying on contributions from readers, a model which has helped the ’s parent company edge towards breaking even after years of heavy financial losses.Others prefer to rely on wealthy iniduals: the Atlantic is benefiting from an investment by Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple’s founder, Steve Jobs, while MEL Magazine has won plaudits for its coverage of online culture, despite being the corporate branding project of a razor manufacturer.“The challenges that the establishment players and new players face are very similar,” said Nielsen, who urged competitors not to gloat at the pain experienced by new rivals, with many journalists set to lose their jobs.“We live in a world with intense competition for attention, for advertising, and for people’s money. There may be schadenfreude – these people were the future once – but this is not in any way good news for traditional players.”How the online media cuts are affecting online publishers:Employees: 11,000Valuation: $5.2bn in 2018Revenue: $600mJob cuts: 800What’s happening: The parent company of HuffPost, AOL, Yahoo, and Tumblr was founded in a bid to take on Google and Facebook by creating a new media giant but has struggled to gain market share.

This is his 14th studio album, and, he says, his last, after an extraordinary career in which he has transformed the music of the continent. Since his days with Mali’s legendary Rail Band, his solo work has included everything from the electronica and keyboard-backed breakthrough solo set Soro in 1987, to less happy jazz funk albums, exquisite semi-acoustic sets Moffou and M’Bemba, and a collaboration with Gotan Project’s Philippe Cohen Solal, who produced his last offering, Talé, six years ago. The title of this final album translates as Another White, in reference to his early struggles as an albino musician (also the theme of his 2009 album La Différence). Although it includes the autobiographical Lerou Lerou, it is dominated by praise songs – to God, mothers, hunters and … a friend who gave him a plane.This self-produced release is aimed at the commercial mainstream, with the throbbing backing dominated by keyboards, guitars and horns pitched against female backing singers and occasional flurries of the kora. There are too many collaborations, with Angélique Kidjo and rapper MHD appearing on the cluttered Itarafo and Alpha Blondy contributing to the reggae track Mansa Fo La, though Ladysmith Black Mambazo’s rousing harmony vocals are a welcome addition to the semi-acoustic Ngamale.What makes Un Autre Blanc distinctive and special is Keita’s vocal work. He is on compelling form throughout, from the soaring, pained anti-war song Syrie to the magnificent Tiranke, on which he switches from thoughtful passages to bursts of controlled power, with backing provided by ngoni and his own acoustic guitar. If this truly is his last recording, he’ll be badly missed.Also from Mali, the world’s finest ngoni band, Bassekou Kouyate and Ngoni Ba, return with Miri, an engagingly laid-back set in which Bassekou’s wife, Amy Sacko, is joined by male singers including Afel Bocoum. And Tartit, Mali’s finest female-led desert blues band are back after 12 years and still in hypnotic form, with AmankorThe Exile. From New Orleans, Leyla McCalla’s The Capitalist Blues is a gloriously varied blend of local jazz, zydeco and calypso, with reminders of her Haitian roots and angry new protest songs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1d129e62f2f899f5f682d7a843394afbd851908/0_192_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24b17e5c0ac89230456ff0029670e63b","title":"business of kidnapping inside the secret world of hostage negotiation ransom insurance","story":"Official policy in the UK and US – unlike in many other countries – is to never make concessions to kidnappers. Those taken sometimes die as a result. Is it time to rethink? By  Joel SimonIn 1982, a British insurance broker named Doug Milne set out in search of new markets. His speciality was kidnapping and ransom insurance, known in the industry as K\u0026ampR. Milne enrolled in a Spanish-language course in London, and a month later, with rudimentary skills and only one or two solid contacts on the ground, he boarded a flight to Bogotá. On his first day in the Colombian capital, Milne was walking to a meeting with a potential client when, he recalled, “a guy pulled up alongside and this chap who was walking in front of me, his head just exploded”. It was a drive-by assassination.Milne cancelled the meeting and spent the afternoon in a bar near Bogotá’s entertainment district. “I missed my meeting and I think I left there about 11pm after having drunk a couple of flagons of Tres Esquinas rum,” Milne told me. He was, of course, horrified. But he also realised that he’d come to the right place. While he knew nothing about the victim or the motive, the murder drove home to him the extent to which Colombian society was at the mercy of criminals and guerillas. His clients needed what he had to offer.Kidnapping and ransom insurance was created in the 1930s, but it wasn’t until the 60s that it began to really catch on, following a spate of kidnappings in Europe by groups such as Eta in Spain, the Red Army Faction in Germany and the Red Brigades in Italy. The appeal was simple: in the event of a kidnapping, the insurance would provide reimbursement for ransom payment.There were caveats to prevent fraud and to ensure that the existence of the policy did not actually increase the risk of kidnapping. The first was that the policy had to be kept secret. In fact, it could be voided if its existence became public. The concern was that if the kidnappers knew of the policy, they would demand more money.The second principle is that the policy will only reimburse the ransom once it is paid. The insurance company never fronts any money. In order to raise the cash, the victim’s family will probably have to liquidate assets – mortgage the house, sell stocks, pool money from other relatives. This process makes the negotiations credible by dragging them out. This is not just about minimising the payout by the insurance company. Quickly making good on a large ransom raises the expectations of future kidnappers. It can make hostage-taking more lucrative and more common.When K\u0026ampR insurance first came on the market, the policyholders were left on their own to negotiate with the kidnappers. But in the mid-1970s, an insurance broker named Julian Radcliffe came up with an idea that would revolutionise the industry. Along with a few colleagues, Radcliffe convinced their company to set up a subsidiary focused on hostage response. The subsidiary, which they named Control Risks, would hire security experts – mostly former military and police – to handle negotiations. The cost of hiring the consultant was included in the policy and borne by the insurance company. In 1982, Control Risks became an independent company.By the early 80s, hostage-taking was on the rise in Latin America, particularly in Colombia. When Milne arrived in Bogotá, he discovered a vast, untapped market. As an insurance broker, he sold a variety of policies offered by different companies available through the Lloyd’s exchange in London. The job of the broker is to serve the client and to advocate for their interests in the event of a claim. The underwriters represent the insurance companies. Specialised, high-risk policies were placed on the Lloyd’s insurance exchange, and Milne would field offers from different underwriters. He would select the policy that best suited his client.To his South American clients, Milne was as quintessentially British as James Bond. He attended boarding school in Scotland, and dresses in tailored suits with a perfectly positioned pocket square. He enjoys a stiff drink, sometimes two. “When I went to Colombia, everyone wanted to see me,” Milne told me. “I started with a few contacts, but it grew like Topsy. All their friends at the golf club wanted to meet. It suddenly became a viable business.”Some grumble that in an industry that values discretion, Milne is a bit of self-promoter. But no one denies his success. By the time he wrapped up his stint in Latin America in the 1990s, he had sold hundreds of new policies, recruited a specialised team in London focusing on the Latin America market, and developed a new service to provide risk mitigation – a “preventative training” programme that educated clients on how to reduce the risk of kidnap and how to respond if it does happen. He then convinced insurance companies that they should foot the bill. (After all, both insurance companies and their clients have an interest in reducing the likelihood of a kidnapping.)London is the global centre for K\u0026ampR insurance, but it has not always been a comfortable fit. Different countries take different approaches to dealing with the kidnapping of their nationals – and the UK, along with the US, has long been a leader of the so-called “no concessions” camp, officially refusing to negotiate with terrorists, pay ransom or make concessions.In April 1986, Jennifer Guinness, the wife of banker and member of the Guinness brewing family John Guinness, was kidnapped by a gang that demanded a ransom of £2m. She was rescued in a police raid only eight days after being abducted. But the fact that a K\u0026ampR policy had been triggered and Control Risks were brought in to negotiate a possible ransom sparked outrage. “Private security firms such as the ones called in on the Guinness kidnapping are operating at the very frontiers of official tolerance,” a top police official announced.The Thatcher government charged that the insurance industry was fuelling a global kidnapping epidemic, facilitating the payment of ransom and undermining the British no-concessions policy. The logic of that policy is that paying ransom puts a target on the back of British citizens, increasing the risk of future kidnappings. It also puts money into the hands of terrorist organisations, which is used to finance their ongoing operations.In 1986, the issue of K\u0026ampR insurance was debated in parliament, which passed a motion expressing concern. There was even talk of working through European institutions to impose a ban on K\u0026ampR insurance throughout the European Union. Recognising that its existence was under threat, the security industry rallied, arguing that since the policies were kept secret, it was clear that people were not being kidnapped because they had insurance. Rather, they were being taken hostage because they had resources – and banning insurance would not change this. Since the policies only provided reimbursement and were always written for amounts less than the net worth of the policyholder, the industry also argued that insurance did not drive up the amount of payment. What’s more, the industry pointed out that the availability of K\u0026ampR insurance helped international businesses to manage risk, which in turn allowed companies – including British and European companies – to operate in dangerous environments while exercising appropriate “duty of care” toward their employees.While the British and European debate eventually wound down without new legislation being introduced, inidual countries throughout the world continued to wrestle with how best to respond to kidnapping. Italy, for example, passed a law in 1991 that banned the payment of ransom and the sale of K\u0026ampR insurance. (One consequence was that the families of kidnapped Italian citizens simply stopped reporting the crimes to the authorities.) Meanwhile, Colombia banned ransom payments, then unbanned, then banned them again. Spain operates a very different policy, where its intelligence services are told to bring hostages home at all costs. Because of its willingness to pay, the country has a tremendous record of success.Through the debates and policy changes, the K\u0026ampR industry not only survived but thrived. Then came September 11 2001, which changed the terms of the whole discussion. Rather than challenging the K\u0026ampR industry as a whole, governments increasingly sought to draw a clearer distinction between criminal groups, to whom ransom could legally be paid, and terror groups, to whom it could not. The US and UK governments both maintained lists of Foreign Terrorist Organizations who could not receive ransom payments. In industry parlance, these groups were designated as “proscribed”.This attempt to draw distinctions between criminal and terrorist organisations raised many tricky questions. It was clear that K\u0026ampR policies could not reimburse policyholders who paid a ransom to a terrorist group. But could security consultants handle negotiations? Could they help families to raise and assemble the funds? And what about the families themselves? Would they be held legally liable for paying ransom to terrorists? “It’s all a grey area,” Milne acknowledged.Further complicating the process is the fact that kidnappers often try to hide their identity. Hostage negotiators told me that some terror groups pretend to be criminal organisations so they can collect ransoms. The opposite also occurs. Criminal groups who are ignorant of the legal prohibitions sometimes pretend to be terror organisations in the hopes that the fearsome reputation of these groups will push negotiations along. Under the law, the onus is on the insurance company to demonstrate that kidnappers are “proscribed” in order to invalidate the policy. Negotiators working for the victim’s family would sometimes refrain from asking obvious questions about the group holding the hostage. They simply preferred not to know.Meanwhile, decisions about which groups were designated as terrorists were often politically determined and sometimes arbitrary. For example, a 2011 case, Masefield AG v Amlin Corporate Member, determined that the payment of ransom to Somali pirates was legal under British law. As a result, Somali pirates were presumed to be criminals rather than terrorists, even when ties to al-Shabaab militants were alleged. Meanwhile, it was illegal to pay ransom to a criminally oriented kidnapping cell in Nigeria if they were seen to have ties to proscribed groups such as Boko Haram.In effect, the collision of disparate national policies and the insurance market creates complexities that determine who lives and who dies in international kidnapping cases. In 2008, a Canadian journalist, Amanda Lindhout, was kidnapped in Somalia, along with an Australian colleague, Nigel Brennan. As young freelancers, they did not have insurance. Officially, neither Canada nor Australia pay ransom. Driven by desperation, their families found a way forward.The one factor in their favour was that the group that kidnapped the pair was a criminal and not a terror organisation. Because they were not “terrorists,” the Canadian government entered into negotiations, offering to build a school or provide development aid in exchange for Lindhout’s release. But the kidnappers wanted cash. They tortured Lindhout to put more pressure on her family, which had few resources. Realising that the negotiations were going nowhere, Lindhout’s mother, Lorinda Stewart, decided that the only hope was to pay a ransom. Canadian officials warned Stewart that paying ransom was against the law and that she could be prosecuted for doing so, but she forged ahead.Once Stewart made the decision, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which had been handling the case, withdrew all support. The hostage-negotiation team that had been camped in her living room moved out. Stewart, working with the Brennan family in Australia, eventually raised enough money to hire a security consultant from London-based firm AKE to take over the negotiations. The consultant advised the families that negotiations would take several months and they would have to pay a ransom of around $600,000 each. His prediction was spot on. Lindhout and Brennan were freed in November 2009. Their families ended up in massive debt.In some cases, US and British hostages have also been freed through dramatic rescues. On 25 January 2012, US Navy Seals dropped into Somalia and rescued kidnapped US aid worker Jessica Buchanan and her Danish colleague Poul Thisted, shooting dead nine of their kidnappers. Officials had decided to launch a rescue because Buchanan had developed a kidney infection, and they believed her life was in danger. Negotiations, which were being carried out by a security consultant and monitored by the FBI, were not progressing fast enough. Most importantly, the US had good intelligence on the hostages’ location and ideal weather conditions for a successful rescue.Despite such successes, rescuing hostages through military force is not a scalable solution to international hostage-taking. Only a handful of countries have the military capacity to pull off such a raid, and they are also extremely risky. According to industry data, either a hostage or a rescuer is killed in half of all rescue operations. One tragic example was the 2009 raid carried out by British special forces in Afghanistan that freed kidnapped New York Times reporter Steve Farrell, but led to the death of a British soldier along with two Afghan civilians. Farrell’s Afghan colleague, journalist Sultan Munadi, was also killed, possibly shot accidentally by British forces. These deaths were all the more tragic because private negotiators who were communicating with the kidnappers already had a deal for both hostages’ release. It was not clear that the British government was ever aware.In September 2011, a dramatic case tested the resolve of the British authorities’ no-concession policy, when a British couple, Judith (“Jude”) and David Tebbutt, were attacked by Somali pirates while vacationing in Kenya. Their son Ollie, a 25-year-old furniture designer, was at a job site in Glasgow when a colleague came to tell him that the police wanted to see him. “Because my parents were on holiday, I assumed something bad had happened, like maybe a car crash,” Tebbutt recalled.After a week-long safari, his parents had booked a stay in a secluded resort called the Kiwayu Safari Village on the Kenyan coast. One night, Somali kidnappers raided the property and abducted his mother. His father David was killed trying to resist.For weeks after being given the news, Ollie was in close contact with the Foreign Office. He was also visited by representatives from SO15, the counterterrorism command of the British politan police, who were investigating the possible involvement of members of al-Shabaab in the abduction. Eventually, Ollie was able to arrange a proof-of-life telephone call with his mother. The kidnappers wanted a huge sum – around $10m. But Ollie discovered that tucked into a travel insurance policy obtained through his father’s work was a clause that provided kidnapping and ransom insurance. “It was incredibly lucky, really,” Ollie said.Through the policy, two security consultants from Control Risks were assigned to the case. “That’s when the government said: ‘You have to make a choice – it’s either us or them.’” Ollie recalled. He found the security consultants to be sober professionals. They explained how the negotiations would work, and that the sole focus would on getting his mother back alive. “They were very much like, we do this every day, and this is expected in this part of the world, and this is our pattern for what a Somali kidnap looks like,” he said.Meanwhile, the government representatives explained that Britain did not pay ransom, and would not countenance any arrangement that put money in the hands of terrorists. While the identity of the kidnappers was murky, the line between al-Shabaab militants, pirates and criminals in Somalia was a fluid one. The best that British officials could offer the family was to essentially walk away – to put what they called “clear water” between the government and any negotiations. Their rather charitable interpretation was that since the kidnappers were demanding money they had to be criminals.As an only child, Ollie was the family’s point person in the negotiations. He moved into his parents’ home, and over the next six months negotiations were carried out around the kitchen table. They were surprisingly orderly. After each phone call, the kidnappers would arrange a follow-up conversation. Generally, they kept their appointments. A Control Risks consultant would brief him on what to say, and sit by his side. A representative from the politan police monitored the discussions, but did not participate or interfere.The Tebbutts were a comfortable middle-class family, but did not have millions. Ollie found the kidnappers had a pretty good sense of the value of their hostage, and over the next few months, under the guidance of the Control Risks negotiator, their demands steadily dropped. They finally agreed to accept a ransom of around £600,000. The only way Ollie was able to come up with that sum was to use the death benefits he received following his father’s murder.In March 2012, Ollie and the negotiator travelled to Nairobi to make the final arrangements. Control Risks contracted a pilot to drop the money, but there were some tense moments when the authorities that controlled the local airstrip demanded a larger cut. Once that was worked out, and the kidnappers indicated they were prepared to release their hostage, things changed. “At that point, the security consultant drove me to a crossroads in Nairobi,” he recalled. “On one side there was a jeep with the Foreign Office guys in it, and I just crossed the road and got in their car. That was the last time I saw anyone from Control Risks.”From that point on, the British government took over. British officials travelled to the Nairobi airport to collect Jude, and then took her to the British high commission, where she was reunited with her son. Eventually, the full ransom that Ollie had paid was reimbursed under the terms of the K\u0026ampR policy.On the one hand, Ollie is grateful that the British government allowed him to pay a ransom despite the fact that his mother’s kidnappers may have been linked to al-Shabaab. (A British researcher told me that he visited the FCO office to discuss the case while Jude was being held, and was told the government was not interested in hearing any information about the terrorist ties of the kidnappers.) On the other hand, his experience caused him to focus on what he sees as the hypocrisy and heartlessness of the government’s position. In order to apply pressure, Jude’s kidnappers were depriving her of food, slowly starving her to death. If negotiations had dragged on for a few more months, “she would have died for sure,” Ollie believes.Ollie is soft-spoken and understated, but he told me he thinks the British government’s policy is “so crazy”. He continued: “It makes absolutely no sense. I don’t believe for a second that the kidnappers are checking passports or trying to figure out who is from where. They just grab whoever they can. I don’t think the British policy protects people in a way that they claim it does, but they are so entrenched in this idea. The idea that they get to choose who a terrorist group is based on pretty flimsy reasons sometimes. At the same time, governments sell weapons or trade with regimes that are incredibly bad.”The logic of the no-concessions policy, he believes, is that a certain number of hostages must die in order for the government to show its resolve. If the British government had designated Jude Tebbutt’s kidnappers as terrorists, he says, “my mum would not have come home.”Security consultants and private negotiators fill a critical role in hostage recovery, and have an undeniable record of success in criminal cases. They can even do some things that governments can’t, such as credibly claim limited resources as a strategy to get the price down. Governments, of course, can’t plead poverty.Yet the whole system, as imperfect as it already is, breaks down in terrorism-related cases. If the victim is from a “no-concessions” country, security consultants can offer only limited support. If the victim is from a country that negotiates, such as France or Spain, the private security consultant is generally asked to step aside while national intelligence agencies takes over. While the security consultants are pleased to see their clients come home, they are not happy about the massive payouts.“The market is now too inflated,” one experienced security consultant told me. “Governments have deep pockets and are basically unable to do what a traditional K\u0026ampR consultant would do, which is to put up resistance, to claim an inability to pay, to bargain, to try and disincentivise the crime.”Such arguments may seem self-serving, but there is evidence to support them. In one case, a New York Times journalist who was captured in Afghanistan in 2008 tried to argue with his captors, who were demanding $25m and the release of 15 prisoners. He told them they were out of touch. They countered that the French had recently paid $38m for the release of an aid worker, and that an Italian journalist had been ransomed for $15m and the release of several prisoners. Quickly capitulating to high ransom demands – as some European and Asian governments have done – makes kidnapping more attractive and lucrative around the world. While governments might make a distinction between proscribed and criminal groups, kidnappers don’t. And so the markets are inextricably linked.So what should governments do? If the goal is to bring the hostages home safely while reducing the threat of future kidnapping and minimise the money flowing to terrorist groups, then there are legitimate questions about whether the no-concessions policy is achieving the desired result.First, a series of studies carried out in recent years provide little evidence that kidnapping victims are targeted according to nationality. Thus refusing to pay ransom does not appear to reduce the incidence of the crime, but does greatly increase the likelihood that the victim will be killed. Perversely, in the current environment, it may actually increase the money flowing to terrorists, because kidnappers can execute their British and American hostages, who because of the no-concessions policy have little value, as means of putting pressure on the European countries that pay multi-million-dollar ransoms. This is why the problem must be defined differently and more narrowly. How can western countries work together not to stop ransom payments to terrorist kidnappers – which is an unattainable goal – but rather to minimise their size? Clearly, the K\u0026ampR industry has a key role to play.However, the benefits that security consultants provide are only available if people have access to kidnapping and ransom insurance. Governments should work with the industry to develop innovative ways to extend coverage to vulnerable groups. K\u0026ampR coverage can be tucked into travel-insurance policies or provided through employers whose staff operate internationally. For high-risk groups, such as freelance journalists and volunteer aid workers in conflict zones, the challenge is more difficult. But governments can work with the industry to develop specialised products, even if these require public subsidies.Finally, the families of kidnapping victims who lack insurance should be given access to security consultants in extraordinary circumstances, such as those with national security implications. This can be done by creating an industry-wide pro bono standard, whereby security companies increase their volunteer services. It could also be done via some sort of government pool that needy families can access if certain standards are met.When I met with representatives from the Foreign Office, I found them dug in to their view that the no-concessions policy was simply not up for discussion or debate. This is a shame, because data made available in recent years does not support its central contention, namely that refusing to pay ransom reduces the risk of future crime. Moreover, as Doug Milne notes: “By refusing to allow concessions, you drive the negotiations underground, so the intelligence you might otherwise get following the case disappears. The families feel they could potentially be prosecuted. And the government becomes the enemy.” That’s a bad outcome that does not serve the hostage, or advance Britain’s national security. It’s time to consider a new approach.Adapted from We Want to Negotiate: The Secret World of Kidnapping, Hostages, and Ransom, published by Columbia Global Reports and available to buy at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bd6796a9d30d57abc0c4b54d22c6062c07df8b4/0_95_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=881d4f1c49b46159d7bc179ac8e7bdce","title":"planning for no deal on the brexit frontline podcast","story":"With less than 10 weeks to go until Britain leaves the EU and still no withdrawal deal agreed, businesses around the country are scrabbling to prepare for the worst-case scenario of a disorderly Brexit.

When a statue of Captain Matthew Flinders was installed at Euston in 2014, the only regret of those who had campaigned for a memorial to the explorer – who led the first circumnavigation of Australia – was that his final resting place, understood to be somewhere near the London rail station, was unlikely ever to be known.Five years later, that mystery has been solved by archaeologists working on the new HS2 rail link. The remains of the British navigator – buried over 200 years ago – have now been discovered in a graveyard being excavated to make way for the high-speed line between London and Birmingham.Only a small proportion of the 40,000 bodies being exhumed from St James’s cemetery, behind the station, have been identified so far, making the discovery of Flinders’ remains earlier this month a “needle in a haystack” find, according to HS2’s lead archaeologist, Helen Wass.While some of those buried in the cemetery had tin name plates on their coffins, many of these have not survived. But when Flinders died in July 1814, aged 40, the plate on his coffin was made of lead, meaning it was still legible.“All the records showed that he was buried there, but actually finding someone with a breastplate confirming their name is really amazing,” said Wass. “It is so exciting.” The find is more remarkable because when Flinders’ sister-in-law visited the cemetery in 1852, the location of his grave was already lost.As the first person to circumnavigate the continent and the explorer who popularised its name, Flinders is a figure of national importance in Australia, where a mountain range, two national parks, a university in Adelaide and one of the main streets of Melbourne, among many other things, are named after him.As such, said the country’s high commissioner to the UK, George Brandis, the discovery of his remains is “a matter of great importance to Australia”.In his native Britain, however, he has been largely forgotten, despite a biography that could almost compete with Robinson Crusoe, the novel that first inspired him as a child to go to sea.Born in Lincolnshire in 1774 to a family of surgeons, Flinders joined a navy ship aged 16 and a year later was sailing with the notorious Captain William Bligh, formerly of the Bounty, who taught him navigation and chart making. By 24 he had charted Tasmania and been the first to prove it was an island.Five years later Flinders had circumnavigated the entire continent, and charted much of its coastline, accompanied by his beloved cat Trim and an Aboriginal man called Bungaree – notably the first person ever to be described as an “Australian”.Forced to dock in Mauritius on his way home in 1803, Flinders was arrested by the French, with whom Britain was by now at war, and held on the island for seven years. Trim, his companion in captivity, disappeared the following year, likely stolen and eaten by a hungry slave years later Flinders was still mourning “the best and most illustrious of his race”. In many of the statues of Flinders in Australia – and at Euston – he is accompanied by the faithful Trim.“He wants to go to sea, and the way to do that is to get to grips with mathematics and trigonometry, which he does really, really well. I think he must also have had quite a lot of charm, as he is promoted and supported by people quickly.”Along with many of the other skeletons excavated from the St James’s site, Flinders’ remains will now be examined by osteo-archaeologists. They will be looking for lessons as to how his life at sea affected his health.

Sure. A maiden. Starc plays out Perera, preferring to block than bludgeon. Kurt’s turn. 100th over: Australia 302-8 (Patterson 29, Starc 7) Bang, bang! Batting for 67 balls without a boundary, Patterson has struck two in two balls off Chameera, pulling with power through midwicket then flogging a cut shot past point for another. Getting his chance later in the over, Starc got a bouncer down to his feet for a quick single, Patterson making it three fours in the over from the final offering with a cross-bat wallop through point! 15 from it, the 300 up as well.“Down at the Australian Open arena,” Abhijato Sensarma says, trying to make us jealous. “Djokovic is serving an utterly moral-draining pounding to the talented French tennis player Lucas Pouille, taking the first set 6-0. As it happens to be, David Warner is in the crowd with a cast on his hand. He sits next to Ricky Ponting. The former has a smile on his face, with the on-air commentators mentioning the ‘pain’ he has caused the country. ‘Just for a while,’ the man adds, with a tone which leads me to not believed him easily.” Keep a close eye on that.99th over: Australia 287-8 (Patterson 16, Starc 6) Runs around the field off Perera, Patterson a couple to point then another to cover. Starc then takes two to midwicket to finish. Yep, I think they’re preparing themselves for happy hour. I neglected to post the Head and Paine wickets from Lakmal’s earlier spell. 98th over: Australia 282-8 (Patterson 13, Starc 4) After the drinks break, Starc has one ball to face to finish the successful Chameera over and he’s off the mark with a lavish cover-driven boundary. It makes sense for them to put the foot down here with 17 overs left tonight and a healthy lead already in the bank.A 21-ball duck for Cummins, Chameera earning his edge with another ball that tails away delightfully. I’ll say it again: beware the injured fast bowler! Fantastic cricket from the Sri Lankans, doing the best with what they have after dark.97th over: Australia 277-7 (Patterson 12, Cummins 0) Perera’s radar is a touch off this time, a leg bye from Patterson then a bye down the legside. To finish, the more recognised batsman gets one to midwicket to keep the strike. As soon as the set is done, Perera runs down to the rooms. “Is there a nightclub down there?” asks Michael Vaughan. “Love Island,” replies Kerry O’Keefe. That kicks off a conversation about what the villa would be like if Shane Warne went in. Huss wants none of it. 96th over: Australia 274-7 (Patterson 11, Cummins 0) If Chameera is going as badly as his body language between overs suggests, this is a brave spell from him, charging in and bending his back well enough to jag back into Cummins’ pad with arms raised. He then capped the over with one that went the other way, beating the right hander outside the off stump. On Fox, Kerry O’Keefe is comparing Lakmal to Terry Alderman. The attack leader is standing on the boundary, ready to come back on shortly. It should be fun when he does. This is why day-night Tests are superb.95th over: Australia 274-7 (Patterson 11, Cummins 0) Before Perera started the new over, Chameera again looked to be battling with a hobble to long leg. Can they keep him on long enough for Lakmal to recover and go again? Bowling at Patterson, the off-spinner nearly beat the dancing left-hander to begin, which meant that he stayed home in defence for the rest. 94th over: Australia 273-7 (Patterson 11, Cummins 0) Chameera looked a spent force half an hour ago but now he’s back on the field and beating the bat of Cummins with a lovely little away swinger. There is no pace about but with the pink ball at this time of night it is all about accuracy. 93rd over: Australia 273-7 (Patterson 10, Cummins 0) Perera was through that set in about 90 seconds, doing Lakmal no favours. Patterson made it to double figures along the way, from the inside portion of his blade to square leg. Cummins also inside edged near the bat pad but not near the hand of the catcher. With that over bowled, Lakmal leaves the field, which means his fine spell is complete. 92nd over: Australia 272-7 (Patterson 9, Cummins 0) Not to be! The hat-trick ball was his worst of the set, waaaay outside the off stump. Chandimal retains the five slips (!) for Cummins throughout the over, beating him with a pair of beauts. The second of those prompted an enthusiastic appeal from the posse behind the wicket but Umpire Illingworth wanted none of it. What a wonderful spell. How many more can he get through? 91st over: Australia 272-7 (Patterson 9, Cummins 0) Perera is getting plenty of movement and ample bounce from round the wicket but Patterson is up to the task. Suddenly, his job is a very important one. Stand by for the hat trick ball! 90th over: Australia 272-7 (Patterson 9, Cummins 0) We will have to wait for the hat-trick ball, Lakmal’s pair of wickets from the final two deliveries. What a superb over from the Sri Lankan attack leader, at the very moment that they looked set to be batted out of this Test with their two other quicks off the field injured. That’s leadership. Lakmal is on a hat-trick! He has squared up the Australian captain first ball, finding the edge, just making the journey to Mendis at second slip. That’s a gorgeous piece of bowling and an equally fantastic catch coming forward. Well, it may have been a nice time to bat but Head has not made the most of it. It came back a long way from Lakmal, shaping back into the left-hander from over the wicket, clipping the top of the stumps. Sorry for saying in the previous post that it was Patterson facing, the man on debut was watching that safely from the other end. IS HEAD OUT LBW TO LAKMAL? Umpire Illingworth says so! But he’s sent it upstairs. Stand by. 89th over: Australia 269-5 (Head 82, Patterson 9) Patterson gets off strike first ball in the same way he got off the mark, to mid-on with a firm push off Perera. Head is content playing conservatively until the final delivery, cutting a couple into the gap. Test cricket is never easy, but this truly is the time to cash in.88th over: Australia 266-5 (Head 80, Patterson 8) Lakmal again, who might have to bowl for the entirety of this long final session. There isn’t a lot going on, Head defending the accurate deliveries and leaving the wide alone, including one down leg. Super shot to finish, leaning back to crunch a slightly shorter ball through point for four from the balls of his feet, ala Joe Root at his best.87th over: Australia 262-5 (Head 76, Patterson 8) It is back to Perera for the injured Chameera, the offie who sent down a lovely set to begin this session. He’s now coming from the Stanley Street End, the sun slowly setting over his left shoulder. Coming round the wicket to Head, he takes one to square leg. Patterson’s turn, the new man leaning into a drive but only as far as the man at cover. “Patterson has just got to be careful,” notes Michael Vaughan on TV after miscuing a defensive push. “He’s just leaning over too far.” 86th over: Australia 261-5 (Head 75, Patterson 8) Lakmal gives Head enough room to free his arms and punch down the ground off the back foot for three to begin, taking him three quarters of the way to a ton. This is the third time that the South Australian has made it into the 70s in Tests but he simply has to convert this time around. With bowlers down everywhere, he won’t get a better chance. 85th over: Australia 258-5 (Head 72, Patterson 8) Yup, Chameera is in more trouble than the early settlers, chatting to Chandimal between balls, limping back to his mark. But, of course, beware of the injured bowler. Sure enough, he beats the blade of Patterson before the over is done then leaving the field. We have an answer to the Jim Maxwell poser! From Carl Jepson: “The aforementioned gentlemen commenced their test careers at No. 7?” Ding, ding, ding! Bradman’s first has been of interest to me this summer because it was played at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground, where two Tests were held - including his debut. Nearly a century on, Manuka next week becomes just the 11th in Australia. By comparison, in India during the 2017 tour, Australia played at three new venues - Pune, Ranchi and Dharhamsala - making 27 in their history.84th over: Australia 256-5 (Head 71, Patterson 7) Lakmal does replace Perera, which is a bit disappointing for those of us who enjoy watching finger spinners do their thing with the new ball. For that, you can thank Dipak Patel. As it was in the previous over, the only scoring shot is a three to Patterson, this time leaning on a full ball, placing it through cover. With Chameera all-but cooked and Kumara off the field, there’s a lot riding on Lakmal’s spell right now. “Evening Adam.” G’day, Phil Withall. “With regard to the banner. The whole thing has been badly dealt with from the beginning. Cricket Australia seemed to think it would just blow over and no harm would come of it. That is the most disappointing aspect (the content of the banner is obviously abhorrent beyond belief). The soft handling of things like this only empowers the idiots to repeat such things and escalate them. The less punishment the more ennobled they become. Prejudice has no place in sport or society as a whole and those that display it need to understand this.”Well said. For CA’s part, I suspect there might have been some confusion about what the statement means. Of course, it is coded. If a Pepe the Frog banner were unfurled it would be just the same. Anyway, as I said, you’re all across this. 83rd over: Australia 253-5 (Head 71, Patterson 4) Patterson gets three more now, tucking Chameera off his pads easily enough. The quick gets through the over with his pace dropping. As they note on TV, he looks spent at just the wrong time. 82nd over: Australia 250-5 (Head 71, Patterson 1) The new man is playing with soft hands until Perera gets one to drift and turn beautifully, beyond his outside edge. He’s getting considerable bounce with the second new ball, too. Another excellent delivery follows, going on with the arm. The expectation was that the offie was on now to help change ends of the quicks but they should keep him going on the evidence of this set. To finish, Patterson dances down the track to take his first run in Test cricket, down to mid-on. It took 14 balls and included a 40-minute wait. But he’s away now and what a relief that must be. “They (CA) won’t do anything about this unless the cops do?” asks Laura Caughey, our favourite Irish umpire. “And they banned three players for a year for ball tampering after the ICC already issued their sanctions?” Nice pick up. The players are back on the field. Perera has the ball at the Vulture Street end, bowling at Patterson who is yet to score with Australia resuming at 2495. PLAY! An update on the disgraceful nonsense from last night. I’m pleased that WA Police are investigating as that is the only real way that CA will ban the idiots for three years, as they have the capacity to do. I know that I don’t need to explain the origins of that particular slogan to OBO readers. To that end, it’s a disgrace that they could just stroll into, say, the WBBL final tomorrow. They’re not welcome.This will mean nothing to those in the non-footy states, but Luke Hodge is on Channel Seven at the break with Damien Fleming. I can’t wait to eat that right up. What do these men have in common? As Jim Maxwell entered the dinner room here behind our position here in the press, this is what he put to me. In turn, I said I would begin by asking the OBO if they can work it out in less time than I did. McCartney, Noble, Kippax, Bradman, GS Chappell, and now, Kurtis Patterson. Go! Hello, by the way. How about a debut ton for the new southpaw with all the runs coming in the final session against the pink ball? Dare to dream. For now, keep me company with a formal note or a searing hot take. I’m open for business. Australia’s session, Australia’s match, but still that defining innings remains elusive for Australia’s batsmen. Marnus Labuschagne got close with his 81 - the top score of the summer for Australia in Tests - but his composed knock ended when he handed his wicket away out of the blue shortly before Dinner.Travis Head may yet pile on the runs to become Australia’s first centurion of 2019 but his innings has not been without good fortune. He should have been caught two hours ago but Niroshan Dickwella and the slip cordon made a meal of a routine edge behind the wicket. The final session of the day promises plenty. Under lights Kurtis Patterson will show what he’s made of, and with his side already in command of this Test the shackles should be off for the young New South Welshman.Adam Collins will take you through the next phase of play so I shall take my leave, find a spoon, and resume my career as a Pete Townshend lookalike. See you tomorrow. 81st over: Australia 249-5 (Head 71, Patterson 0) Patterson’s dot ball debut extends to eight but he does rotate the strike courtesy of a leg-bye. It’s an innocuous opening over with the new ball by Lakmal, his pace in the mid to high 120s kph which is far from threatening at this level without prodigious sideways movement. Head is happy to stand his ground and stride off for the Dinner interval.The second new ball has been taken immediately. Lakmal will have one over with it before the Dinner break. 80th over: Australia 248-5 (Head 71, Patterson 0) Head dabs out a maiden with the end of the session fast approaching. Not only that but the second new ball is also now a consideration. 79th over: Australia 248-5 (Head 71, Patterson 0) The left-handed Patterson begins his Test career with five dot balls. Oh no! Such a shame for Marnus Labuschagne. He’s been chanceless all session but in the shadow of the Dinner break he chips Dananjaya harmlessly to short midwicket and he has to go. There was a century and more for the taking but a summer’s summit of 81 will have to do. 78th over: Australia 248-4 (Labuschagne 81 Head 71) Dickwella is adamant he has Head caught behind off the bowling of Perera but Richard Illingworth is unmoved and Sri Lanka have no reviews remaining. Short and wide from the bowler and not the smartest shot from the batsman. We await the DRS replays. 77th over: Australia 247-4 (Labuschagne 80 Head 71) Dananjaya’s back into the attack after that light relief from Karunaratne but it’s an inauspicious start, a full toss followed by a long hop. Among this Labuschagne sprints an all-run four and dabs a single into the offside to reach 80, Australia’s highest inidual score of this Test summer. 76th over: Australia 240-4 (Labuschagne 74 Head 70) *Milestone Klaxon*: this is now Australia’s highest fifth-wicket partnership versus Sri Lanka. In further good news for Australian sport, Sam Stosur has just won a grand slam. 75th over: Australia 238-4 (Labuschagne 74 Head 68) Karunaratne gets a third over and he justifies it with a beautiful opening delivery that kissed the deck and gambolled beyond Labuschagne’s outside edge. There’s an appeal for LBW soon afterwards but umpire Erasmus is wise to a faint inside edge. 74th over: Australia 234-4 (Labuschagne 71 Head 67) Sri Lanka’s fielding so far has been dreadful, missing catches, chaperoning boundaries and gifting singles. The latest aberration allows Head to jog through for a run but it almost works in the tourists’ favour. With Labuschagne on strike Perera beats the bat for the first time in a long time and appeals heartily for LBW. It’s declined on field but SRI LANKA REVIEW! The ball spun past the inside edge of Labuschagne’s bat from a delivery sent down from over the wicket. DRS confirms it was missing leg stump and Sri Lanka burn their second and final review. 73rd over: Australia 231-4 (Labuschagne 69 Head 66) More right-arm reputation destroyers from Karunaratne, but this time he loses his line to Head and invites a delicate glance to the fine-leg fence for the first boundary in yonks. There’s a much shorter wait for the next four, Karunaratne offering too much width and Head slashing confidently through the offside ring. 72nd over: Australia 223-4 (Labuschagne 69 Head 58) This match is happening, I am absorbing it, but I’m damned if I can pick out much to report. One leg-bye from the latest unremarkable over. 71st over: Australia 222-4 (Labuschagne 69 Head 58) Sri Lanka turn to the part-time medium pace of Karunaratne. I love this. Proper old school net bowling medium pace junk. Keeper’s stood up, pace is a smidgen over 100kph, and the batsmen are terrified of getting out. A couple of singles keep the game moving.

The truth is, there are simple food switches we can make to eat fewer animal products, and with the likes of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s introducing non-dairy versions of some of its most popular flavours, being vegan is now easier than ever.Here are five simple store cupboard updates that will help you be a little more vegan …Flax seedsThe sheer number of things you can use flax seeds for is, quite frankly, mind-boggling.First off, flax eggs. One tablespoon of ground flax seeds mixed with 2-3 tablespoons of warm water becomes a mixture that has the same texture and volume as egg white. You can use these flax eggs in place of chicken’s eggs when binding bakes or adding body to things such as pancakes.Ground flax seeds are also a powerful thickening agent for everything from porridge oats to pasta sauces. Adding a subtle nutty taste and a slightly crunchy texture, they work best with deep flavours such as curries.What makes flax seeds even more essential for vegans is that they contain omega-3, the same kind of good fats you get from oily fish. These oils are essential for optimal brain function, blood flow and can even help reduce the risk of heart disease, so if you’re not getting enough flax seeds in your diet, now’s a great time to start.Keep them whole, boil them with some water and you can even make your own glue or hair gel with them – check out the videos online if you don’t believe us.A word of warning: once ground, flax seeds start to lose their beneficial properties over time, so if you buy them whole, grind them up in a smoothie maker and store them in the fridge. That way, you’ll get the most from these mighty, mini seeds.ChickpeasWhen we say chickpeas, you probably think hummus, and rightly so. Hummus has become a firm favourite in the UK over the past decade, enhancing mealtimes as a condiment and serving up a time-saving savoury snack when combined with veggies or pitta bread.If you have a blender and have never made hummus, you’re missing a trick. It’s a whizz – just blitz a can of chickpeas with a tablespoon or two of tahini, olive oil, lemon juice and salt, then add a teaspoon of water at a time until it all turns into that wonderfully familiar, rich, pale, hummusy-textured gloop.Chickpeas aren’t just tasty, though – they’re an excellent source of complex carbs and fibre.And whatever you do with your can of chickpeas, don’t throw away the water. Known as aquafaba, this juice is rich in starch and is a great egg replacement for making meringues or macarons.Pasta sauceWe’re all busy people, and having a staple, cost-effective “meal in minutes” recipe can be the difference between success and failure when embarking on a new diet. What’s handy is that vegan quick fixes can be pretty similar to non-vegan ones, with a piping hot, saucy bowl of pasta being up there with the best of them.Other than puttanesca, which contains anchovies, most jars of tomato-based pasta sauces are free of animal product.Nutritional yeastThe name might make you think of baking and bread, but unlike traditional yeast, nutritional yeast is deactivated, so it doesn’t rise when warmed and wet. It has a distinctly nutty, cheesy taste and looks a lot like fish food flakes.An insider vegan secret for a long time, these tart, deep and earthy-tasting flakes can be sprinkled over pasta as a parmesan replacement, combined with probiotics, ground cashews and agar-agar – a vegan gelatine substitute – to make vegan cheese. They’re also excellent in a crumb coating when whizzed up with some flax seeds.Coconut oilIn a world with no dairy, coconut oil reigns supreme as the most indulgent alternative around. Combined with almond butter and some agave, it’s a sweet, satisfying snack. Melted and ready to get sizzly, it’s the base flavour for the richest stir-fries and curries. And if you’re using cold-pressed coconut oil in baking, it adds a creamy, subtly tropical aroma and taste to everything from brownies to cookies.Melting at around 24C (76F), it tends to stay solid at room temperature in most climates, and in a similar way to cocoa butter, becomes liquid when melted in our hands or mouth.In addition, cold-pressed oil – the pricier variety – can raise levels of good cholesterol. Meanwhile, the cheaper, standard coconut oil carries no coconut flavour, so is an excellent, versatile fat for cooking coconut flavour-free dishes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e5a1c12521a64d3cea857c1fac9bf31f03c908/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0238ba8cb151c3d792d2bbbeb387d0df","title":"from ice cream to nice cream the inside scoop on the ice cream revolutionaries","story":" In 1978, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield set out to make ice-cream with a difference. Here’s how Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is still pushing boundaries and fighting for change 40 years laterWhen Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield first set up shop in an old petrol station in Burlington, Vermont, in 1978, selling scoops of homemade ice-cream, they wanted to build a company that cared as much about people as profits.Since then, their tiny ice-cream business has become a global brand whose famous flavours, including Cookie Dough and Cherry Garcia, are sold in 35 countries. Yet, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s ethos remains the same: to “make great ice-cream in the nicest possible way”.It’s a belief that is central to everything the brand does, from its social activism to constant experimentation with new flavours. The ethos inspired Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s line of non-dairy ice-creams that was launched in the UK in 2017 to a rapturous reception from vegans. The flavours – Chunky Monkey, Chocolate Fudge Brownie and Peanut Butter \u0026amp Cookies and the new flavour Coconutterly Caramel’d – are just as inventively delicious as the brand’s dairy creations.For Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s employees, honouring the goals of its co-founders – who remain advisers to the company since being bought by Unilever in the year 2000 – is vital. “Right from the start, Cohen and Greenfield wanted the business to be a force for good,” says Rebecca Baron, the brand’s social mission manager. “Four decades on, we’re still guided by their values.”Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s three-pronged approach – making excellent ice-cream achieving financial success and using the brand to make the world a better place – stems back to ideas developed by Cohen and Greenfield in the company’s early days.The company works with social enterprises, such as Greyston Bakery in New York, which supplies the brownies that make the Chocolate Fudge Brownie flavour so enticing. “They employ people with criminal records, homeless people, recovering addicts and vulnerable women – people who are finding it hard to get a job,” says Baron. “They offer subsidised housing and healthcare to their workers.”Once Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s popularity began to grow, it quickly realised that it could use its platform to campaign on social issues. It was a discovery born of a David and Goliath tussle with its rival, Häagen-Dazs.“Greenfield had the idea to pack the ice-cream into pint-sized containers and sell it in convenience stores, but Pillsbury, who owned Häagen-Dazs, didn’t like this at all,” says Baron. “They threatened all their stores with exclusivity clauses, saying they could stock one, but not both. Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s didn’t have the resources to fight it in the courts, so Greenfield created a one-man picket outside the Pillsbury headquarters. Pictures of him were everywhere. They managed to mobilise hundreds of thousands of people to put pressure on Pillsbury to back down, which they eventually did.”The same principle is applied to its latest campaigns on issues including climate change, marriage equality, racism and refugees. The brand is currently running a company-wide campaign, lobbying the UK government to allow asylum seekers the right to work. “At the moment, they’re banned, which means people can be living in poverty for years,” says Baron. “We’re using every tool we have as a business to mobilise our fans to help us create systemic change.”One area the brand is pouring a lot of effort into is reducing its carbon footprint. Its caring dairy programme has more than 300 participating farms in the US and Europe. “The idea is that the farms that Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s offers support to have to meet high environmental standards,” says Baron. “The company is always working to move into increasingly sustainable farming practices and improve its emissions.”The launch of its almond milk-based non-dairy range – with more flavours set to arrive in Britain in 2019 – is a way to offer a lower-emission alternative to the increasing numbers of people who aren’t necessarily vegan, but want to make more ethical food choices. “So many people want to reduce their personal carbon footprint, so it’s great to give people that flexibility,” she says.And for those who are vegan, or lactose intolerant, the range aims to prove that it needn’t mean missing out. One of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s key principles is inclusion, which its non-dairy range fits into perfectly. “We wanted to offer people who can’t – or have chosen not to – eat dairy ice-cream, an alternative that is just as good as the dairy version,” she says. “We wanted to make sure they get some love, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8bc71bface7ef6903bde9854f48c8988b922630/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f948dcdbaf8026e4e43892e7df17b71a","title":"theres never been a better time to be vegan","story":"With restaurants, chefs and well-known brands introducing more vegan options than ever, sticking to a plant-based diet is now both simple and indulgent, says Club Mexicana’s Meriel Armitage A decade ago, when I decided to go vegan for ethical reasons, the word “decadent” was one you’d never have used to describe the food available. More often than not, it fitted the joyless stereotype of lentils, quinoa and tofu, with the occasional Linda McCartney vegan sausage to liven things up. Now, though, ask a vegan what they ate last night and they’re likely to say anything from pizza topped with gooey melted “cheese” to crispy fried “chicken” or pulled jackfruit burritos. The vegan scene has truly exploded, introducing food that’s exciting, colourful and indulgent, whether you’re vegan or not.When I launched my pop-up, Club Mexicana, in 2012 I wanted to challenge the boringly virtuous chickpea and chia seed perception of veganism. Inspired by my travels in the US, where vegan food is innovative and delicious, I wanted to prove that being vegan doesn’t mean missing out.I realised the joy of Mexican food doesn’t stem from the meat, but the bold, punchy flavours created by salsas and pickles – the meat is just a carrier for those flavours. We try to be as creative as possible with our dishes, which include tacos with baja “tofish” – tofu fish – and roasted cornbread with pecan mole, smoked soya yoghurt, pickled pear and smoked tomato. When we first started holding supper clubs, a lot of people didn’t even notice the food was vegan, which is what I wanted.Over the past few years, vegan ingredients have evolved rapidly, which has helped vegan cooking to become as exciting as it is. Vegan cheese used to be terrible, but now you can buy everything from vegan blue cheese and camembert to cheddar and ricotta – all tasting as piquant and decadently creamy as the real thing. At Club Mexicana, we serve deep-fried “mozzarella” sticks made with coconut oil, which are crispy on the outside and oozingly melty in the middle.People also often wrongly assume that going vegan will mean depriving themselves of indulgent desserts and treats, but that’s no longer the case either. The naughtiest dish we offer is deep-fried ice-cream doused in chocolate sauce – it really doesn’t get more indulgent than that.More and more restaurants are offering innovative vegan menus. Supermarkets now stock an amazing range of vegan food that’s expanding all the time. Brands, such as Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s, are constantly bringing out new vegan products that are causing a buzz outside, as well as inside, the vegan world.There’s never been a better time to be vegan, or just to introduce more plant-based alternatives into your everyday diet. With so many amazing colours, textures and flavours on offer, you never need to feel you’re depriving yourself of the food you love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49f1d79eab00c096029a0f24adce39e26d71d75b/0_144_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86991549f58274fd012365b6124d3563","title":"let them eat cake wealthy republicans play down severity of shutdown","story":"Leading politicians have been accused of being tone-deaf when it comes to the 800,000 federal workers who haven’t been paidWith the government shutdown entering day 34, members of the Trump administration continue to play down its effect on workers’ lives.Donald Trump himself has framed it as a patriotic sacrifice made in the name of his quixotic national security ambitions, while some of the wealthier members of the administration have characterized going without pay for a month as a minor speed bump easily overcome.On Thursday the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said he “doesn’t really understand why” government workers have started going to food banks for sustenance.Appearing on CNBC, Ross, whose net worth has been reported as at least $700m , suggested furloughed workers take out bank loans instead.“The 30 days of pay that some people will be out, there’s no real reason why they shouldn’t be able to get a loan against it,” he said, seemingly encouraging government workers to apply for predatory payday-style loans, uncertain when they might be able to pay them back.Some of those workers, who are set for a second missed paycheck on Friday, have taken to drastic measures to stay afloat. In Chicago, Transportation Security Administration workers have been stopping at area food pantries in uniform on their way to unpaid work, while in north Texas food pantries have said their resources have been pushed to near the breaking point. Over the weekend food banks in the Washington DC area reported being deluged.Ross also offered criticism of TSA workers who have been unable to continue to show up to work unpaid.“It’s kind of disappointing that air traffic controllers are calling in sick in pretty large numbers,” he said. Many of them cannot afford to do work for nothing, he was told by the host Andrew Ross Sorkin.“Well, remember this, they are eventually going to be paid,” Ross said. “And even if they aren’t, it’s not like it’s going to be a big hit on the economy overall.“You’re talking about 800,000 workers and while I feel sorry for the iniduals that have hardship cases, 800,000 workers, if they never got their pay, which is not the case, they will eventually get it, but if they never got it, you’re talking about a third of a percent on GDP so it’s not like it’s a gigantic number overall,” he said.Very good news for the GDP. Workers might not be so lucky. While an IOU may work for a multimillionaire, I’ll pay you eventually doesn’t tend to work when it comes to rent and groceries for working families.Ross’s comments characterized a more general response to the shutdown from the wealthy right.The White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett suggested furloughed workers were “better off” over the Christmas holiday because they were getting time off without having to use vacation days.“And then they come back and then they get their back pay, then they’re, in some sense, they’re better off,” Hassett said.Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, echoed that sacrificial sentiment and praised unpaid government workers as noble “volunteers” laboring for love of president and country.When asked how coming to work without pay for fear of being fired counted as volunteering, Kudlow, a millionaire, bristled at the question. “They do it because of their love for the country and the office of the presidency and presumably because their allegiance to President Trump …”On Monday Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, waded into the shutdown controversy, saying going over a month without pay was a “little bit of pain”.“Listen, it’s not fair to you and we all get that,” she said on the digital news network Bold TV. “But this is so much bigger than any one person. It is a little bit of pain but it’s going to be for the future of our country. And their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.”Meanwhile anger from unpaid staffers compelled to arrange travel for Mike Pompeo’s wife, Susan, for the pair’s eight-day trip to the Middle East, boiled within the state department.“This is BS. You don’t bring more people that need staffing, transportation, etc when embassy employees are working without being paid,” a source told CNN of the trip.Melania Trump too has been criticized for utilizing a military plane for a vacation to Florida just as the president blocked the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, from visiting troops in Afghanistan.Responding to Ross’s comments, Pelosi asked “Is this the ‘let them eat cake’ kind of attitude?”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fef2eff24f487bde31a733cb2aa260ed0b4014f4/57_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efed841b8efc959af15b8bc000793de0","title":"racism parents teach children","story":"As images of teens seemingly mocking protesters and giving apparent Nazi salutes go viral, parents can help ensure children understand sensitive issuesIt’s now common to come across a headline about videos or photos of teens that goes viral and strikes a nerve. Teenagers posing with Nazi salutes, painting on blackface and, most recently with the students from Covington Catholic high school, seemingly mocking Native American protesters. What may initially be seen as a joke between friends suddenly delivers hurt, frustration and backlash from thousands on social media.Many come to the teens’ defense, saying that kids will be kids as adolescents, they have and will always do some stupid things. “Until 10 minutes ago, it was broadly agreed in our culture that kids are allowed to do some dumb things because they’re kids,” said Kyle Smith for the National Review in response to the backlash against the students from Covington Catholic high school.But experts in youth and teenage behavior say this behavior isn’t inevitable. There are ways parents and teachers can help ensure a child has the maturity and understanding to think about sensitive issues such as race before they behave inappropriately.“We could raise a future of anti-racist youth if we wanted to,” said Jennifer Harvey, author of Raising White Kids: Bringing Up Children in a Racially Unjust America and professor of philosophy and religion at Drake University. “That’s the work we have to be doing in a very proactive, every single day kind of way to reduce the incidents that are happening in the first place.”Parents, specifically white parents, can develop tools needed to raise children who are sensitive to race, Harvey said. For example, teaching children that race doesn’t matter can be counterproductive to achieving equality.“If you’re living in a society where people are not being treated equally … that position ends up enabling racism to thrive,” Harvey said.For example, if a five-year-old child never sees an African American doctor, they will assume African Americans can’t be doctors unless their parents have discussed structural racism with them, Harvey said. “That’s just how kids’ brains work.”Evan Apfelbaum, an associate professor at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business focused on social psychology and ersity, agreed that it’s good to start teaching children about race when they’re young.“Having these tough, uncomfortable conversation at home in advance, in a structured setting, is one way to help prepare kids for facing these types of complex things in the real world,” he said.Parents can use such viral videos that demonstrate inappropriate behavior as an opportunity to have a conversation with their children about racism, Apfelbaum added.Salome Thomas-El, head of school at Thomas Edison charter school in Wilmington, Delaware, agrees that parents and teachers can use viral videos as learning tools, but they should be wary of the other things their children may come across on social media. Something he and many educators struggle with is limiting the negative influences that can come from online, he said.“We have to be aware of what’s going on in the online community and how it impacts what will happen in school,” Thomas-El said. “Prevention is much more powerful than intervention.”Students at his own school go through internet safety training, Thomas-El said, where they learn the full consequence of a viral video. “Children need to understand once you post a video, and it goes viral, you can’t take it back,” he said.It’s also important for teachers, parents and teenagers themselves to understand how a teenager’s developing brain can shape their behavior, said Dan Siegel, clinical professor of psychology at the University of California Los Angeles medical school.The “remodeling” of the teenage brain into an adult brain entails four core changes: emotional sparks, social engagement, novelty-seeking and creative exploration — what Siegel calls “Essence”. The four changes represent an uptick in passion, drive to be a part of a group and a desire for new experiences that is normal for teenagers. These changes can be positive or negative, depending on how they’re fostered, Siegel said.The development also heightens what psychologists call “in-group, out-group distinction”, or the tendency to lump oneself in social groups, he added. When a person feels like their “in-group” is threatened by an “out-group” – people part of a group they don’t identify with – there’s a chance they will dehumanize the out-group.“Adolescents are equally prone to having this in-group-out-group distinction” as adults are, Siegel said. “Essence” exacerbates the distinction, and that’s what can be seen in the viral videos, he added.In these videos, there’s evidence of “emotion they don’t know how to control, collaboration where they give up morality to gain membership, novelty-seeking which drives them to do things that are really dangerous … and following ideals as they push against things that have them not think logically”, Siegel said.Helping teenagers learn about things like in-group, out-group phenomena and how their changing brains affect it will give them the ability to be mindful of their behavior.“When you let an adolescent know they’re in charge of how their brain is going to develop in these important dozen years of life, that’s totally different from saying: ‘Adolescents, this is what’s going on with you and do this,’” Siegel said. “It’s kind of empowering from the inside out.”If a child ends up behaving badly, experts agree that it could be a moment of self-reflection, but parents and teachers need to hold themselves accountable for the behavior as well.“Kids respond to positive reinforcement and modeling behavior,” Apfelbaum said. “Parents should focus on showing kids the right way to respond and how to show respect and tolerance of differences.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1ada805d660eb8ef779a9a831e691618ad8cba3/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a0e1975b19ecff06abc278952b07e9d","title":"venezuela news latest what happened after day drama","story":"Constitutional crisis takes a back seat to half-empty schools, sparsely stocked shops and grinding commutes across CaracasThursday morning in Caracas dawned much like any other day in the slow decline of Venezuela’s Bolivarian revolution: sparsely stocked shops were open, commuters boarded decaying metro trains and clapped-out buses to get to work.Schools were half-empty, buses were harder to find, but apart from that, the capital was mostly calm, and there was little indication of the previous day’s extraordinary events – or that two men now claim to be the country’s rightful ruler.To roars of approval from thousands of supporters – and the enthusiastic support of the Trump administration – Juan Guaidó, the former head of the national assembly, declared himself interim president on Wednesday.It was the most brazen challenge so far to the government of Nicolás Maduro who immediately dismissed the move as a coup attempt orchestrated by an alliance of the “fascist right” and “the coup-mongering, interventionist gringo empire”.Overnight, security forces clashed with protesters in the working-class neighborhood of Petare in eastern Caracas, and isolated incidents of looting occurred.Guaidó’s bold gamble set the scene for a political standoff: neither side seems willing to budge, and each leader can count on international support.What that means for Venezuelans remains far from clear, said Alejandro Rondón a 24-year-old management student who joined a pro-Maduro rally on Wednesday.“What Mr Guaidó did seems irresponsible to me: he is deceiving people – and he’s leading us into a constitutional labyrinth it will be hard for us to get out of.”Rondón allowed that there were frustrations with the government but he was confident that the people would stick with Maduro – if only out of loyalty to his late mentor and predecessor. “In moments like this we close ranks because of our respect for Hugo Chávez.”And despite growing uncertainty over the country’s future, life continued more or less as normal for Venezuelans on both sides of the political ide.“I almost didn’t get to work,” said Simara Romero a 35-year-old waitress, who crosses Caracas twice a day for her job at a coffee shop in the east of the city. “It took me an hour to find a bus that would bring me to work. And now that I’m here, we’ve only had two clients.”Venezuela has seen two previous attempts to unseat Maduro through mass street protests – both of which failed, prompting government crackdowns which left scores dead on both sides, and thousands jailed. So for many Caraqueños the latest unrest had an air of deja vu.“I can’t keep grinding my life to a halt every time there is trouble – it’s endless here. And besides, you kind of know the drill,” said Cristina Fernández, a graphics designer, as she carried her shopping to her car .“I didn’t take my kids to school, but other than that life must go on. It’s not like me stopping is going to bring down the government,” she said. “And I need to work because I need the money.”“My president is Juan Guaidó – not because the US says so, but because I want him: I want a change. The country can’t go on as it is,” said Caty Aguilar, 54, as she headed out from home in Petare. She works three jobs as a house cleaner, and sells phone cards and inidual cigarettes – but even that is barely enough to get by.Aguilar’s daughter is one of the 3 million Venezuelans who has fled the country, and occasionally sends remittances back home from Peru, but Aguilar also relies on the occasional box of subsidized food handed out by the government. She said a local official had warned her she would lose the subsidy if she attended anti-government protests, but she shrugged off the threat.“I just don’t care any more. I don’t think the government has the money to keep buying them much longer anyway,” she said.Across the country, Venezuelans turned to the strategies they have relied on in previous outbreaks of political drama.Fernández said that many Venezuelan families have come up with methods to get through periods of turmoil: “You stock up on food a couple of days when you see it coming. You keep kids home. You obsessively check Twitter and WhatsApp – but you no longer forward every post because most videos of burning cities or wounded people are fake or from Nicaragua,” she said.But this week’s developments have added a new element of uncertainty to familiar rituals: since Guaidó took his oath of office, neither he nor Maduro have made any significant public appearance or official indication of their plans.Internationally, supporters of the two men have lined up on familiar geopolitical lines: Russia, China, Cuba, Turkey and Nicaragua have backed Maduro the US, the UK and most of Venezuela’s Latin American neighbours have backed Guaidó.But how that support plays out on the ground remains unclear. When Donald Trump official recognized Guaidó as president, Maduro responded quickly by giving all US diplomatic staff 72 hours to leave the country.However, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said that US diplomats would remain in Venezuela because Maduro – who he described as an “ex-president” – lacks the legal authority to break off diplomatic relations”.An email sent by the US embassy to its citizens in Venezuela emphasised they “are keeping regular hours” and on Thursday morning the street outside the embassy was quiet, with no sign that Venezuelan security forces were preparing to enforce Maduro’s deadline.Additional reporting by Mariana Zúñiga"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53ee9ab2162a79285cde5fd35da0d4ef582cab7a/0_29_1152_691/master/1152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=739db5b5ac3f621a7a03e37a69659dac","title":"egypt frustrates giulio regeni investigation three years on","story":"Italian doctoral student’s family seek truth about his torture and murder in early 2016Three years after the disappearance, torture and murder of Italian doctoral student Giulio Regeni in Cairo, Egypt is stonewalling Italy’s efforts to investigate.In November, Italian prosecutors officially named five members of Egypt’s security services as subject to investigation in the case of Regeni, who went missing on 25 January 2016 aged 28. But two months on, Egypt has barely acknowledged the development.“The Rome prosecution has done everything in our ability. The situation is one of stalemate,” chief prosecutor Giuseppe Pignatone told an Italian parliamentary body that oversees the secret service last week.Regeni disappeared after leaving his apartment in the Dokki neighbourhood of Cairo, on his way to meet friends. After a frantic search by his parents and friends, his body was found at the side of a desert highway on 4 February, showing signs of torture. His mother later said she could only identify him from “the tip of his nose”. Last year, Pignatone said he believed that Regeni was killed because of his politically sensitive research into trade unions.“We have asked justice for Regeni,” the Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, told a press conference on Wednesday. “Next time I’ll run for president in Egypt,” he said, implying this would be the only way to achieve this. “But I trust the Italian prosecutors, and I trust the Egyptians,” he added.Italian prosecutors’ efforts to investigate were frustrated from the start. Italy sent its own team of investigators to Cairo in January 2016, but they were forced to run a parallel investigation rather than cooperate fully with their Egyptian counterparts, who performed the initial autopsy of Regeni’s body in Egypt without any Italian officials present.Despite the friction, Italy has maintained governmental and trade relations with Egypt. Italian weapons companies were well represented at Egypt’s first defence exposition in December, including those selling small arms to Egypt’s military and police. The Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, highlighted the “outstanding partnership between Egypt and Italy” in a meeting this month with Claudio Descalzi, the CEO of the Italian energy giant Eni..In the meantime, Italian investigators have persistently pressured their Egyptian counterparts to provide much-needed information on the case. After two years of tense negotiations to obtain CCTV footage of the Cairo metro on the day Regeni disappeared, Italian prosecutors said what was provided contained “unexplained gaps”, rendering it useless. Egyptian officials blamed technical difficulties for the loss of the critical footage, and have since offered little detail about whether or how the data might be recovered.The precise nature of the torture that Regeni suffered and the location of his corpse, close to a detention facility used by Egypt’s national security agency, had long drawn suspicions internationally that members of Egypt’s security agencies were responsible for his murder. Yet at home, Egyptian officials offered a very different view. “The security services are the ones who will say who did it,” the then vice-minister of justice and forensics expert Shaaban al-Shamy told the  in 2016. Egypt later admitted that the student was under surveillance before his murder.In late November last year, angered by the lack of progress from the Egyptian side, Italian prosecutors placed five members of Egypt’s security services under investigation over Regeni’s disappearance and on suspicion of impeding the investigation.Egypt outright rejected Italy’s investigation of the officials. “Egyptian law does not recognise what is called the ‘record of suspects’,” said the country’s state information service, taking the opportunity to cast doubt on Regeni’s visa status while in Egypt.Requests for comment from Diaa Rashwan, who heads the state information service, and a spokesman for Egypt’s ministry of foreign affairs, yielded no response. After Italy’s parliament cut its relations with Egypt in November – a move that left governmental relations unchanged – Ahmed Mustafa, deputy chairman of the Egyptian parliament’s ethics committee, said that the Italians were using the Regeni investigation “as a tool of political exhortation”.Alessandra Ballerini, the Regeni family’s Italian lawyer, stated at a dramatic press conference in Rome in December that she had a list of 20 suspects, which she termed “20 names of men who should start being afraid”.“I find hard to believe that the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, was not aware of what was going on with Giulio Regeni. It’s impossible he didn’t know anything about this,” Ballerini said.The Regeni family have vowed to seek the truth about what happened to him. “Dear Giulio, they stole your life, today you would have turned 31,” his mother Paola tweeted on 15 January, his birthday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbe8b6ff2693f722803e69fb6e3db18184d76c70/0_231_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4e5f2d60ce577e3bbcc1b60eb2738fd","title":"friday briefing consider leaving venezuela us tells its citizens","story":"Defence chief says moves to oust President Maduro risk ‘chaos’ … Queen’s ‘common ground’ advice … Matthew Flinders’ grave foundGood morning. This is Alison Rourke bringing you the last briefing for the week.Venezuela’s crisis shows no signs of abating as the US state department ordered all its non-emergency staff to leave the country and urged US citizens to “strongly consider” leaving. It came as the head of Venezuala’s armed forces warned of a civil war sparked by a Washington-backed “criminal plan” to unseat president Nicolás Maduro. “We are here to avoid, at all costs … a conflict between Venezuelans,” defence minister Vladimir Padrino said in a live broadcast, as he declared his support for Maduro.Meanwhile, the president’s challenger, opposition leader and self-appointed interim president, Juan Guaidó, offered Maduro an amnesty if he went quietly. In his first interview since Wednesday’s dramatic declaration, Guaidó said he was determined to bring Maduro’s “dictatorship” to an end, stabilise his economically devastated nation and organise free elections “as soon as possible”.In Washington, diplomatic onlookers were left scratching their heads over the possible next steps in US’s push for regime change in Caracas. As Julian Borger writes, remarks by senior administration figures suggest the Trump White House has not completely worked out the full details of its ambitious gambit to change the Venezuelan leader.‘Common ground’ – The Queen has delivered a speech calling for people never to lose “sight of the bigger picture” in what has been seen in some quarters as an veiled reference to Brexit. In the speech to the Sandringham Women’s Institute, she spoke of the virtues of “respecting” the other person’s point of view. It echoed her Christmas address when she touched on the same theme, telling the nation: “Even with the most deeply held differences, treating the other person with respect and as a fellow human being is always a good first step towards greater understanding.” Her speech came as Philip Hammond told business leaders they needed to accept the result of Britain’s EU referendum and warned that a failure to implement it would damage the country’s political stability. He said a promise had been made to voters in 2016 that they were choosing a more prosperous future: “Not leaving would be a betrayal, but leaving without a deal would also be a betrayal.”US shutdown – Opposing bills in the US Senate have failed to break the political impasse in Washington where the partial government closure is entering its 35th day. It’s a fresh blow for Donald Trump that has deepened the sense of dysfunctional government and left Washington in deadlock. Meanwhile, Trump’s commerce chief, billionaire Wilbur Ross, was ridiculed for saying he didn’t “understand why” unpaid government workers were turning to food banks, suggesting they should take out loans instead. Critics say Ross’s comments characterise a more general response to the shutdown from the wealthy right, some of whom have suggested workers caught in the shutdown are “better off” because they had time off over Christmas, without having to use up annual leave.C02 set to soar – The Met Office says the level of climate-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere globally will rise by near-record amounts in 2019, fuelled by the continued burning of fossil fuels and the destruction of forests. It will be particularly high in 2019 due to an expected return towards El Niño-like conditions, during which plants and trees’ ability to absorb C02 is reduced. “This year we expect these carbon sinks to be relatively weak, so the impact of record high human-caused emissions will be larger than last year,” he said.Windrush – The high court has ordered a new inquest into the death of Dexter Bristol after the original coroner failed to consider the impact of the Home Office’s “hostile environment” policy on his health. Bristol was 57 when he died, having moved from Grenada to the UK in 1968, when he was eight. He was sacked from his cleaning job last year because he had no passport, and was denied benefits. The original inquest found he died of natural causes but the assistant coroner declined to consider evidence that stress was a contributing factor, something his family challenged.‘Needle in a haystack’ – The remains of the famous British explorer Matthew Flinders, who led the first circumnavigation of Australia, have been uncovered near London’s Euston station, 200 years after he was buried. The graveyard is being excavated to make way for the high-speed line between London and Birmingham. Only a small proportion of the 40,000 bodies being exhumed from St James’s cemetery, behind the station, have been identified so far, making the discovery of Flinders’ remains earlier this month a “needle in a haystack” find, according to the project’s lead archaeologist.Last year investigations around the world showed that historical sexual abuse within the Catholic church had been covered up for decades.

The appeal was simple: in the event of a kidnapping, the insurance would provide reimbursement for ransom payment.Nearly a century later, London is the global centre for kidnap and ransom insurance, but it has not always been a comfortable fit. Official policy in the UK (and US) – unlike in many other countries – is to never make concessions to kidnappers, refusing to negotiate with terrorists, pay ransom or make concessions. The logic of that policy is that paying ransom puts a target on the back of British citizens, increasing the risk of future kidnappings. But those taken sometimes die as a result.

Saying she had a “strong case”, McCallum outlined numerous weaknesses of the legal proceedings: political interference from Donald Trump, the extraterritorial nature of the charges and the fact that Canada is not party to American sanctions against Iran.“I regret that my comments with respect to the legal proceedings of Ms Meng have created confusion. I misspoke,” McCallum said in a statement released late on Thursday afternoon. “These comments do not accurately represent my position on the issue. As the government has consistently made clear, there has been no political involvement in this process.”McCallum’s comments, made to Chinese-language media in Canada, prompted strong criticism from opposition parties – and marked a sharp departure from previous statements from top government officials, with some experts believing they represented in a change of strategy for the government.As Ottawa navigates an increasingly fractious relationship with Beijing, diplomats and elected officials have been careful to stress the independence of Canada’s judiciary and respect for the rule of law.Opposition politicians immediately seized on McCallum’s remarks. “If I were prime minister I would fire John McCallum,” said Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, during a television interview with CBC on Wednesday evening. “To have this type of comment is completely unacceptable and he needs to be held responsible for his actions.”It is not the first time Justin Trudeau has been forced to fend off criticism of McCallum for offhand remarks. Less than a year ago, McCallum created a furore after he favourably compared aspects of Canadian policy to China, at the expense of relations with the US.On Thursday, Trudeau attempted to refocus attention on the plight of two detained Canadians, rather than discuss McCallum’s future. He said: “Making a change would not help release those Canadians a day sooner.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3769857.1548366151!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"simon harris under pressure to clarify when he knew of smear test issue","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Minister for Health Simon Harris faces growing pressure to clarify when he learned as many as 6,000 women would need be retested for cervical cancer because their tests were not conducted within the recommended time frames.The Department of Health on Thursday confirmed Mr Harris was first alerted to the issue in December, over a month before the matter was publicly disclosed.The Minister’s spokeswoman denied opposition claims that the Government had hidden the issue, or had been slow in responding to it.She said last night Mr Harris was “first informed there was a possible issue emerging in December but was also told there was a body of work yet to be done by the HSE to establish the facts around it.“He has not been slow. He requested a report on it. He does not have the full report as requested.”Under persistent questions from the Opposition in the Dáil on Thursday, Tánaiste Simon Coveney insisted the Government was not hiding problems in the cervical cancer screening programme controversy.However, Mr Harris is now expected to fully disclose his knowledge and actions to the Oireachtas when he returns from paternity leave in 10 days’ time.“We need a really detailed statement from him and a clinical lead to explain in detail what happened, why it happened and why nobody should be worried,” said Fianna Fáil health spokesman Stephen Donnelly.Sinn Féin spokeswoman Louise O’Reilly said the public “really need to know when did he find out about it and what did he do before it came to public attention. What is he going to do now to reassure women that this service is fit for purpose?”Alan Kelly of Labour described it as a “scandal upon a scandal” and criticised the Minister for not making it publicly known. “More resources are required to ensure that screening works in an optimal way and women can be sure of the process.”The Government also categorically denied that Mr Harris’s offer of a free smear test to women last year at the time the cervical cancer controversy broke was taken against official advice.Some 90,000 women availed of the free test, in addition to the 230,000 scheduled and routine smear tests carried out last year. It caused the waiting time for results to increase from an average of six weeks to 22 weeks by the end of 2018 and resulted in a small percentage of smear tests having to be repeated as they “expired”, having not been analysed within the required timeframe.Separately, it has emerged that the 6,000 women who will be recalled for repeat smears are those whose smears showed up some abnormality on initial reading. Their slides were then to be tested for the HPV virus but this did not happen within the recommended timeframe for such testing.Dr Peter McKenna, HSE director of women’s and infant health programmes, said a decision was reached by the HSE in 2015 to refer women with a middle-grade cervical smear test reading for an HPV test. The test should be carried out within 30 days of the smear being taken, but it has transpired that the laboratory was counting 30 days from when they received the tests, not 30 days from when the test was taken.“We will have to find out how that happened. Our main concern now is to find the women in question,” he said.The HSE was alerted to the problem last November, he said, when Quest Diagnostics Laboratories advised CervicalCheck of a “specific problem in relation to standard HPV tests that have been carried out outside of the manufacturer’s recommended timeframe since secondary HPV screening was introduced”.“The information is that the test is still very reliable, but we feel it is prudent to do a repeat. We’re in a position to say that the chance of a test giving an incorrect result is very small,” he said.When asked on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland if the volume of women seeking a free cervical smear test following an announcement by the Minister for Health last year had exacerbated the problem, Dr McKenna acknowledged that might have been the case.“But equally you could say because of it this problem came to light.”Damien McCallion, interim director of the HSE National Screening Service, said by the end of next week the screening service would be writing to affected women, who will need to attend their GP for a second smear test.On the offering of free smear tests to women after the controversy broke, Mr Harris’s spokeswoman said: “Simon Harris is quite clear he acted in consultation with officials and HSE in offering the free test to women. No advice was given not to proceed with this before he offered.” She also pointed out that the announcement was welcomed by opposition TDs and Senators last year."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Images posted online from one of three fatal road death incidents on ThursdayResearch indicates genetic dice loaded in favour of thin people and against those at obese end of spectrumGarda\u0026iacute ask members of public not to share crash imagesOnly 2016, 2017, 2015 were warmer than last year, with only small differences among themMan charged with 210 counts of sexual assault, 177 counts of rape, one count of attempted rapeSchools are acting as a safe haven for \u0026lsquoexhausted\u0026rsquo homeless children, review saysLord Mayor Nial Ring defends event amid crackdown on short-term lettingsFormer Anglo Irish Bank chief had been serving his six-year sentence in MountjoyAn 80-year-old woman and a man in his 40s were killed in separate incidentsGovernment denies it tried to hide the need to retest 6,000 women for cervical cancerBill under consideration to accommodate EU rules on introduction of noise regulatorState\u0026rsquos 95-page legislation document covers healthcare, education and social protectionIncident occurred while man was helping load cattle onto trailer near CooraclareLegislation covers issues ranging from social welfare to immigration controlsT\u0026aacutenaiste warns support for Bill could lead to Israel closing Dublin embassyIncrease in final year fees after course restructure still \u0026lsquomajor problem\u0026rsquo, say protestersMikolaj Wilk died after attack at his home in Ballincollig last JunePatrick Kehoe (24) had a few pints before flight he was due to take to Amsterdam, court heardTD tells D\u0026aacuteil of need for debate on role ahead of votes in Cork, Limerick and WaterfordUnpublished report highlighted concerns over university\u0026rsquos student records system"},{"url":null,"title":"the history of the irish border from plantation to brexit","story":"1606-1630: King James I orders the plantation of Ulster, at that time the least populated and most gaelic of Ireland’s four provinces. The plantations follow the defeat of northern Gaelic chieftains and the Flight of the Earls in 1603. The King grants land in six counties west of the Bann Derry, Donegal, Fermanagh, Tyrone, Cavan and Armagh to Scottish and English settlers. Substantial private plantations were also underway involving Scottish settlers in Antrim and Down with large swathes of the two counties were given to loyal Scottish noblemen. Some four million acres are transferred from Gaelic Irish to planters.1641: Ulster explodes in open warfare between English and Scottish settlers and the native Irish. Dispossessed Catholics take their revenge on settlers, slaughtering thousands of them. In 1642 Scottish Covenanters, a Presbyterian militia, invade the North and took their revenge on many of the Catholic inhabitants. Tit-for-tat killings continue for the next decade. “On both sides there is nothing but burning, robbing in cold blood and cruelties such as are not usual even among the Moors or Arabs,” the Irish nobleman Owen Roe O’Neill observed. The massacre of Protestant settlers would have a profound impact on the psyche of those who had settled in Ulster.1690: William of Orange defeats exiled King James II at the Battle of the Boyne. The battle is seen as decisive as consolidating Protestant domination in Ireland.1782-1800: Grattan’s short-lived parliament gave legislative independence within the Crown to an Irish parliament, albeit one consisting exclusively of members of the Protestant Ascendancy.1800: The 1798 rebellion put paid to Grattan’s parliament. The parliament is abolished in 1800 under the Act of Union. Henceforth, Irish MPs will only sit in Westminster. For the whole of the 19th century, Irish nationalists campaign for an end to the Act of Union.1870: Isaac Butt forms the Home Rule Association which campaigns for self-government for Ireland within the United Kingdom.1882: The Irish Parliamentary Party is formed to elect MPs to the Westminster parliament with the goal of achieving home rule for Ireland. The party will dominate Irish electoral politics until 1918.1886: The first Home Rule bill is introduced into the House of Commons by British Prime Minister William Gladstone. The first stirrings of fierce Ulster opposition to home rule are apparent as sectarian riots hit Belfast in June after the bill is defeated. Dozens are killed. Unionist opposition coalesces to oppose Home Rule with the phrase “Ulster will fight and Ulster will be right”.1892: A Second Home Rule bill is passed in the House of Commons, but defeated in the House of Lords.April 1912: The Irish Parliamentary Party again holds the balance of power in Westminster. A third Home Rule bill is introduced into the parliament. This time the power of the House of Lords to defeat it is curbed. It is due to become law in 1914.September 28th 1912: Edward Carson organises the Ulster Covenant. More than 450,000 sign a pledge to resist home rule.January 1913: The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an armed militia opposed to home rule, is founded.November 1913: The Irish Volunteers is founded by nationalists to ensure the introduction of home rule in Ireland and as a counter-militia to the UVF.March 1914: The Curragh incident occurs. More than 50 British army officers based in Ireland indicate that they will resign their commissions rather than move against Ulster. The proposed mutiny convinces many Irish nationalists that the British cannot be trusted to implement home rule.March 1914: John Redmond concedes the “hateful expedient” of partition with the expectation that Ulster will be excluded from the initial home rule settlement though the number of counties involved has yet to be decided. He insists on it being time-limited to six years but Unionist leader Edward Carson dismisses the time limits as a “stay of execution”.April 1914: The UVF smuggle 20,000 German rifles with three million rounds of ammunition into the port of Larne.July 1914: The Buckingham Palace conference takes place between nationalist and unionist leaders over the implementation of home rule. At the same time the British cabinet pores over maps of border counties examining nationalist areas that might be included in a home rule parliament.“We sat again for an hour and a half discussing maps and figures and always getting back to that most damnable creation of the perverted ingenuity of man - the County of Tyrone,” the British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith declares.“I have rarely felt more hopeless in any practical affair: an impasse with unspeakable consequences upon a matter which to English eyes seems inconceivably small and to Irish eyes immeasurably big. Isn’t it a real tragedy?”\u0026nbspNo agreement can be reached about what parts of Ulster can be excluded from home rule. The First World War breaks out a week later.September 1914: The Home Rule Act becomes law, but is suspended for the duration of the war.April 1916: The Easter Rising occurs in Dublin. Rebels who take up arms against the British reject home rule, which would have given Ireland self-government within the United Kingdom. They want an independent Irish republic.July 1917-April 1918: The Irish Convention is called. Nationalists and unionists meet to try and decide an agreed future for Ireland, but the assembly is boycotted by Sinn Féin. The issue of customs dominates many of the early proceedings with nationalists insisting that a home rule parliament should have control of customs revenue - at that time the chief way in which governments raised taxation. This is vehemently opposed by unionists who fear tariffs and customs will cut Northern industry off from its most important market in Great Britain.The final report is passed by 66 votes to 34. It envisaged a home rule parliament for the whole country with safeguards for Ulster, but its implementation is bound up with the introduction of conscription in Ireland in April 1918 and is rejected. Nationalists and unionists would not meet again to discuss the future of Ireland until the Sunningdale conference of 1973.April 1918: After the death of the Irish Parliamentary Party leader John Redmond in March, his successor John Dillon leads the party out of the House of Commons in protest at the imposition of conscription in Ireland.January 1919: Sinn Féin, which wins a landslide victory in the 1918 British general election, convenes the first Dáil. On the same day the War of Independence begins with the goal of securing an independent Ireland. The first Dáil and the War of Independence both envisage a united independent Ireland.September 1919: The British Government struggles to enact the Home Rule Act which is now opposed by both nationalists and unionists. A committee headed by the colonial secretary and arch-unionist Walter Long is set up to examine this option. Somewhat surprisingly the committee proposes a two home rule-parliament solution, one for Ulster and the other for the rest of Ireland. This is a volte-face for unionism as they had been adamant that they wanted to remain an integral part of the United Kingdom. The committee concludes: “The sacrifice which Ulster will be called upon to make in assuming control of its own local affairs is one which the Imperial Government and parliament is clearly entitled to ask its people to make”.Unionist leader James Craig says he will not oppose a parliament for Ulster provided it consists of six counties with a Unionist majority rather than the nine counties of the historic province. This is to ensure a built-in unionist majority into perpetuity. Unionists reason that including the Catholic-majority provinces of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan will imperil the long-term future of Northern Ireland.Many unionists are also convinced that they cannot trust successive British governments to safeguard the separation of Ulster from the rest of Ireland and believe only a home rule parliament for Northern Ireland will suffice.December 22nd, 1919: David Lloyd George introduces the committee findings into the House of Commons. He supports the idea of two home rule parliaments for Ireland and says that if the Irish want unity, the British will not stand in their way. He also warns that the British will fight any attempts by the Irish to separate in the same way the Union fought the Confederates in the American Civil War.December 23th, 1920: The Government of Ireland Act 1920 becomes law almost exactly a year after the bill is introduced into the House of Commons. It creates two home rule parliaments and ides Ireland on a 26 countysix county basis. Northern Ireland is created. The act is rejected by Sinn Féin which is demanding full independence, but Ulster Unionists accept it.June 1921: Northern Ireland is created with the opening of its parliament by King George VI. The King makes a conciliatory speech. He says: “I appeal to all Irishmen to pause, to stretch out the hand of forbearance and conciliation, to forgive and to forget, and to join in making for the land which they love a new era of peace, contentment, and goodwill.”July 11th 1921: A truce is called between crown forces and republicans to allow for talks about the future of Ireland.December 1921: The Anglo-Irish Treaty is signed setting up the Irish Free State and copper fastening partition. The Irish Free State is created and it will have Dominion status within the Empire - effectively independence. Nationalists believe partition will be a temporary issue as clause 12 of the Treaty provides for a Border Commission. Many nationalists are confident that the commission will make Northern Ireland so small as to render it unviable.January 1922: The Treaty is ratified narrowly by the Dáil. A general election in June 1922 is won mostly by pro-Treaty politicians, but it is not enough to prevent the Civil War breaking out.December 1922: The Irish Free State comes into being, making the Border an international frontier.April 1923: The Irish Free State introduces customs controls which will exist until 1993 and the creation of the Single Market. These customs posts are manned with varying degrees of efficiency and smuggling becomes a way of life for many in border areas.November 1925: The Boundary Commission report is leaked to the Morning Post. Far from proposing the wholesale changes nationalists wanted, it only envisaged a modest transfer of land from Northern Ireland to the Free State. The Free State representative Eoin Mac Neill resigns. The Free State Government is panicked by the news and seeks concessions from both the British and Unionist governments. None are forthcoming, with both governments reminding their Irish counterparts that the commission was doing what it set out to do which was to look for possible territorial swaps on both sides of the Border. Eventually the impoverished Free State agrees to drop its demand for the inclusion of nationalist areas in the North in return for a debt write-off. The British agreed to cancel Ireland’s imperial debt obligation and the status quo remains.1932-1936: The Economic War between Britain and Ireland had a detrimental impact on border commerce. Farmers and food producers in border regions are required to pay import duties on agricultural produce goods could only be transferred across the border at 16 customs posts. The impact is severe with cross-border trade declining by two thirds.1956-1962: The IRA’s border campaign sees the closure of many minor roads and increased security in border areas.1969-1995: The Troubles again see the closure of several minor roads and regular British army checkpoints become a feature of life particularly in south Armagh.August 1970: The border road at Crossmaglen is closed after two RUC men are shot dead.August 1972: A bomb planted by the Provisional IRA blows up a customs post in Newry killing nine people, including the three IRA members who planted the bomb.1993: All customs posts on the island for Ireland are abolished as the EU Single Market comes into force.2006: The last British watchtower is dismantled. This effectively ends the Border as a visible entity.June 2016: The United Kingdom votes to leave the European Union.January 2017: British prime minister Theresa May says Brexit means being out of both the single market and the customs union. This means that the integrity of the single market can only be maintained if there is a customs frontier between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. This would most likely mean customs checks i.e a hard border.December 2017: The UK and the EU agree a deal with creates the “backstop”. The backstop states that, in the absence of a comprehensive trade agreement between the EU and the UK, it will ensure there will be no hard border between North and South. In other words, in the absence of another solution for the Border, Northern Ireland will effectively remain within the EU customs union.November 2018: The UK Withdrawal Agreement is published which sets up a transitional arrangement that will be in force until December 2020. Crucially it confirms that the backstop will operate by keeping the UK in the customs union with the EU in order to avoid a hard border.January 2019: The Withdrawal Agreement is rejected by UK MPs by a vote of 432 to 202 making a no-deal Brexit more likely.January 22nd, 2019: The European Commission confirms publicly for the first time that a no-deal Brexit will lead to a hard border on the island of Ireland."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3769785.1548357372!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"simon harris declined meetings with cervical test screening lab","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris was warned that increased pressure on labs was putting the future of the cervical screening system “in jeopardy”.Minister for Health Simon Harris twice turned down appeals from executives from one of the main cervical cancer-screening laboratories last year to meet in relation to pressures facing the CervicalCheck system.Senior figures from MedLab sought a meeting with the Minister last June over testing delays facing the national screening programme, according to correspondence.Meanwhile, the company sought a meeting in December about concerns it had about a review of 1,800 past CervicalCheck smear tests to be carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG)in London.The screening programme has faced increased demand. In the past, it took four to six weeks for a smear-test result, but currently results are taking an average of 22 weeks or longer.It emerged on Thursday that up to 6,000 women will have to retake HPV tests, as the samples were tested outside of recommended time frames, health officials said.Since 2015 if a smear test showed low-grade abnormalities a woman was referred for a HPV test. The approximately 6,000 cases related to tests returned as negative.However, the Health Service Executive is to write to these women by the end of next week, advising them to retake a HPV test.The national screening programme was informed late last November by Quest Laboratories that the delays in delivering test results had “been carried out outside of the manufacturer’s recommended time frame,” a HSE spokeswoman said.The laboratory had dated samples from the day they had been received, not when the samples had been taken. However, health officials stressed the repeat tests were precautionary, and the new samples would be prioritised for testing.At the height of the CervicalCheck scandal last spring the Government guaranteed that all affected women could avail of a free repeat smear test.Last June, Dr Colin Goldschmidt, chief executive of Sonic Healthcare, warned Mr Harris that the resulting pressure on labs was putting the future of the screening system “in jeopardy”.Sonic Healthcare is the Australian parent company of Dublin-based MedLab Pathology (MLP), contracted to process close to half of the total smear tests.The free smear guarantee “led directly to a significant increase in the volume of smear test samples” being sent to MedLab, Dr Goldschmidt said.“Prior to the recent crisis, approximately 4,000 samples would be within acceptable limits of MLP’s maximum screening capacity,” he said. In June the lab was dealing with 20,000 test slides, he said.The correspondence was released to The  under the Freedom of Information Act. “Women must be prioritised and an urgent solution must be put in place,” Dr Goldschmidt told Mr Harris, before offering to fly to Dublin to meet the Minister.Mr Harris did not meet Dr Goldschmidt at the time, and doing so would have been “wholly inappropriate” while Dr Gabriel Scally’s report into the CervicalCheck controversy was ongoing, a spokeswoman for Mr Harris said.On December 14th, MedLab officials sent another letter to the Minister seeking a meeting, which also did not take place. The letter related to concerns MedLab had in relation to a review of 1,800 past CervicalCheck smear tests, to be carried out by RCOG.In relation to the December meeting request, a spokeswoman for Mr Harris said the Minister’s position was that laboratory officials should be referred to the “appropriate decision-makers” overseeing the screening programme in the HSE."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3769200.1548359794!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maduro wins backing of venezuelan senior military figures","story":"Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro says that he will close the country\u0027s embassy and consulates in the United States, a day after severing diplomatic and political ties with Washington. Video: CCTV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRiot police clash with opposition demonstrators during a protest against the government of President Nicolás Maduro on Wednesday. Photograph: Yuri CortezAFPGetty ImagesSenior figures in the Venezuelan military came out in support of President Nicolás Maduro on Thursday, a day after the US said it no longer recognised him as the country’s leader and backed the opposition’s Juan Guaidó instead.“Yesterday we saw a reprehensible event: a man proclaiming himself president,” Mr Padrino López said, referring to Wednesday’s huge street protests in Caracas, during which Mr Guaidó took a self-administered oath as Venezuela’s interim leader. “That’s a very serious matter.”“We are here to avoid ... a conflict between Venezuelans,” he said. “It is not a civil war that will solve Venezuela’s problems. It is dialogue.”In a video posted on social media and broadcast on state TV, other senior military figures also backed Mr Maduro, who has led the country since 2013 but has come under intense pressure to resign since he started his second term as president this month after an election victory widely dismissed as a fraud.Backed by dozens of soldiers in olive green fatigues, other generals stepped forward and added their expressions of support for Mr Maduro.The declarations came after a day of high drama in which, one by one, many countries across the Americas turned their backs on Mr Maduro and embraced Mr Guaidó, the head of the National Assembly, or Congress – regarded widely as the last bastion of democracy in the country.US president Donald Trump hailed Mr Guaidó as the nation’s leader, and other countries – including Brazil, Argentina and Colombia – followed suit in what appeared to be a carefully synchronised move to undermine Mr Maduro.The battle for power of the Venezuelan executive has split the world, however. Russia, China, Turkey and Mexico still regard Mr Maduro as president. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, expressed support for Mr Maduro in a phone call on Thursday, the Kremlin said, as well as his backing for a “peaceful dialogue”.The EU stopped short of explicitly supporting Mr Guaidó but called for elections in Venezuela and backed the national assembly that he heads as the “elected institution whose powers need to be restored and respected”.\u0026nbspFederica Mogherini, EU foreign policy chief, said: “On January 23rd, the people of Venezuela have massively called for democracy and the possibility to freely determine their own destiny. The EU strongly calls for the start of an immediate political process leading to free and credible elections, in conformity with the constitutional order.”\u0026nbspFrench president Emmanuel Macron wrote in a Twitter post: “After Nicolás Maduro’s illegitimate election in May 2018, Europe supports the restoration of democracy. Acclaim the bravery of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who march for their freedom.”The UK said Mr Maduro was “not the legitimate leader of Venezuela” and joined Washington in backing his rival. “The United Kingdom believes Juan Guaidó is the right person to take Venezuela forward,” said Jeremy Hunt, UK foreign secretary. “We are supporting the US, Canada, Brazil and Argentina to make that happen.”Venezuela has become increasingly militarised since Mr Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, a former paratrooper, came to power 20 years ago, and the military’s support could tip the balance of power between the two rival presidents.While the top brass of the military appears to be steadfast in its support for Mr Maduro, there are increasing signs of discontent among the lower ranks, where soldiers suffer the same deprivations as ordinary citizens. Earlier this week, the government quashed a rebellion by 27 members of the Bolivarian national guard – the military police force.“It took the military several hours to express their support for Maduro after Guaidó designated himself president but they eventually came out with clear, if not exactly effusive, support,” said David Smilde, an expert on Venezuela at Tulane University in the US. “I think those hours after Guaidó’s self-proclamation were the key test and Maduro got past that hump. However, his support from the military is clearly not airtight and that will be the key in the days and weeks ahead.”The Maduro government has warned the US of repercussions, saying that “things could happen” at its embassy in Caracas. Mr Maduro has given staff there 72 hours to leave the country, accusing the US of trying to foment a coup.On Thursday, Mr Maduro said he had decided to close the Venezuelan embassy and all consulates in the US.Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said Washington no longer recognised the Maduro regime and would not withdraw its staff. “The United States will take appropriate actions to hold accountable anyone who endangers the safety and security of our mission and its personnel,” he said.In remarks on Thursday to the Organisation of American States, a diplomatic body comprising nearly all the countries in the Americas, Mr Pompeo again denounced Mr Maduro: “His regime is morally bankrupt, it is economically incompetent, and it is profoundly corrupt. It is undemocratic to the core.”Foro Penal (Penal Forum), a Venezuelan non-governmental organisation, said seven people have died this week in clashes between anti-government protesters and the security forces, and more than 200 were injured. Local media put the death toll as high as 16.After Wednesday’s drama, the streets of Caracas were relatively calm on Thursday, and Mr Guaidó kept a low profile.“We’ll have to wait and see what happens. A lot of people are confused, and some are saying he’s already gone into hiding,” said 42-year-old Victor Oropeza in the Caracas neighbourhood of La Yaguara.On Wednesday, prices for Venezuela’s bonds jumped to their highest levels in seven months on hope that regime change might be near in the country, which under Mr Maduro has suffered one of the biggest economic collapses in Latin American history.The economy has halved in size in five years and gross domestic product dropped 18 per cent in 2018 alone, as oil output slumped to its lowest level since the 1940s. The International Monetary Fund expects inflation to hit 10m per cent this year.Some three million people have fled the country in recent years, many of them suffering from hunger. The UN expects thousands more to follow this year. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3769807.1548359255!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"senior uk minister amber rudd calls for free vote on brexit amendments","story":"Former British prime minister Tony Blair said on Thursday (January 24) that he believed the chances of a second Brexit referendum taking place were now greater than 50 percent.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish secretary of state for work and pensions Amber Rudd. “At the moment there is a lot of change going on. I have called for a free vote for the amendments on Tuesday, and we’ll see what position the government takes,” she told BBC’s Newsnight programme. Photograph: Will OliverEPAOne of Theresa May’s most senior ministers has called for Conservative MPs to be given a free vote next Tuesday on amendments designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd suggested she could resign from the government if she is not allowed to vote for the amendments.“At the moment there is a lot of change going on. I have called for a free vote for the amendments on Tuesday, and we’ll see what position the government takes,” she told BBC’s Newsnight in an interview to be broadcast on Thursday night.The government is expected to whip against an amendment tabled by Labour’s Yvette Cooper that would oblige it to delay Brexit rather than leave the EU without a deal. Asked if she would quit if she was not allowed to vote for such an amendment, Ms Rudd declined to rule it out.“I’m going to stick to trying to persuade the government to allow it to be a free vote. There is a lot taking place and there are a lot of new amendments. We’ll have to wait and see,” she said.MPs will vote next Tuesday on a motion “in neutral terms” acknowledging a statement by the prime minister on Brexit. Unusually for such a motion, they can table amendments proposing alternative options for Brexit.Jeremy Corbyn suggested on Thursday that Labour was likely to support Ms Cooper’s amendment, although he said the party would decide closer to the time.“We will decide at the time whether we fully support it or not. I had a very good meeting, a very useful meeting, with Yvette Cooper yesterday. I understand what she is saying, there is a lot of merit in it. We, as a party, will make a decision,” he said.Ms Cooper’s amendment envisages an extension of the article 50 negotiating deadline until December 31st, but Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer has suggested that a three-month extension to the end of June would be preferable.The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday that MPs would have to choose an option for Brexit if they wanted to avoid leaving the EU without a deal.“What we have now is a double majority against the deal on the one hand and against the no deal on the other. But we need something that is positively accepted as an agreement,” he told a German radio station.“In order to avoid this difficulty of leaving without an agreement, this no-deal, it is not enough to vote against the no-deal. No, you have to vote for a contract, an agreement.“If nothing moves, if no positive suggestions are put on the table, then we will be heading for a more or less bumpy or accidental no-deal on March 30th”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Cristian HernandezEPAThe US state department has urged its citizens to “strongly consider” leaving Venezuela and ordered out non-emergency government staff as the head of Venezuela’s armed forces warned of a civil war sparked by a US-backed “criminal plan” to unseat Nicolas Maduro.In a live address to the nation on Thursday, the defence minister Vladimir Padrino accused the Venezuelan opposition led by Juan Guaido and the United States and regional allies such as Brazil of launching an attempted coup against Mr Maduro that risked bringing “chaos and anarchy” to the country.“We are here to avoid, at all costs , a conflict between Venezuelans. It is not civil war, a war between brothers that will solve the problems of Venezuela. It is dialogue,” said Mr Padrino.In a significant blow to Venezuela’s newly energised opposition, the defence minister declared unwavering support for “our commander-in-chief, the citizen Nicolas Maduro”.Further bolstering Mr Maduro’s position, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, spoke to the Venezuelan leader by telephone and issued his first comments on the crisis, which he insisted was “provoked from abroad”, according to a Kremlin statement.Addressing the supreme court in Caracas on Thursday afternoon, Mr Maduro said he had told Mr Putin “a great provocation is under way in Venezuela, directly by the US empire”.“I believe the world is in no doubt: Donald Trump wants to impose de facto, unconstitutional government and carry out a coup in Venezuela against the people and against democracy. They want to dismember the republic.”“Do we want a coup in Venezuela? Will we legitimise a puppet government imposed from abroad? Will we allow our constitution to be violated? No!” Mr Maduro said.Mr Trump has warned that “all options are on the table” for a US response if the Maduro government seeks to hold on to power by force. His national security adviser, John Bolton, refused to exclude military action on Thursday, but said the immediate emphasis would be on economic measures.“What we’re focusing on today is disconnecting the illegitimate Maduro regime from the source of its revenues,” Mr Bolton told reporters. “We think consistent with our recognition of Juan Guaido as the constitutional interim president of Venezuela that those revenues should go to the legitimate government. It’s very complicated. We’re looking at a lot of different things we have to do, but that’s in the process.”He said that Washington was currently trying to strengthen the coalition against Mr Maduro among American and European states. The EU has called for new elections but most member states have not followed Washington in recognising Mr Guaido, the head of the opposition-led national assembly.The UK however, broke European ranks on Thursday and sided with the US.“This regime has done untold damage to the people of Venezuela, 10 per cent of the population have left Venezuela such is the misery they are suffering,” the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said in a statement issued in Washington before a meeting with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and vice-president Mike Pence.“So the United Kingdom believes Juan Guaido is the right person to take Venezuela forward. We are supporting the US, Canada, Brazil and Argentina to make that happen.”The statement stopped just short of echoing US language on recognising Mr Guaido, however. “It is UK policy to recognise states, not governments,” a British official said.The US initially ignored the Maduro government’s order expelling embassy staff, but late on Thursday the state department announced it was withdrawing “non-emergency US government employees”.“We are prepared to do the things we need to do to make sure we keep our people safe,” a state department spokesperson said. “The full range of United States government resources are at the ready to ensure the safety and security of US diplomats and their families.”The US has called for a UN security council emergency session on Saturday to discuss the crisis in Venezuela, although Russia opposes a debate on what Moscow says is an internal Venezuelan matter.A Venezuelan monitoring group claimed at least a dozen people had been killed in the unrest.In his speech, Mr Padrino described Mr Guaido’s decision to declare himself Venezuela’s president on Wednesday as a shameful and laughable fact but one that risked unleashing a wave of bloodshed. “I have to alert the people of Venezuela to the severe danger that this represents to our integrity and our national sovereignty.”Facing “a criminal plan that flagrantly threatens the sovereignty and independence of the nation”, Mr Padrino said the armed forces would remain loyal to Maduro. Dissent would not be tolerated, he added ominously.Analysts have long held that Mr Maduro’s survival depends on the backing of the military, who he has rewarded with senior positions in government and the state oil company PDVSA.But it is unclear how solid that support is. Mr Guaido and the opposition-held national assembly have sought to peel away the military, offering an amnesty to members of the armed forces who help bring about what they term a return to democracy. This week, authorities arrested 27 national guardsmen who tried to launch an uprising against Maduro.Venezuela expert Miguel Tinker Salas said he believed one of the key objectives of Mr Guaido and his international backers was to find and exploit “fissures within the military” in order to unseat Mr Maduro.“What they were hoping, I suspect, was lower-ranking officers to show discontent or to show a break with their superiors. I don’t see any evidence of that so far,” beyond a small uprising in Caracas on Monday.“So far the upper military class - the generals and the senior officers - have shown support for Maduro.”–"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3769581.1548352344!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us recognition of rival leader ratchets up pressure on maduro","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmbattled  Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro speaks  to members of  the Venezuelan armed forces  during a ceremony in Caracas, Venezuela, earlier this month. File photograph: Cristian HernandezEPATime has been called too often on the chavista regime during its two decades in charge of Venezuela for anyone to declare with confidence that its end is now near. But this week marks a dangerous escalation in a political crisis that has already lasted for years, leaving hundreds of people dead and destroying the economy of the oil-rich nation.By declaring himself interim president this week, opposition leader Juan Guaidó has raised the stakes in the already long stand-off with embattled president Nicolás Maduro. But swift recognition of Guaidó by the US and a host of neighbouring nations has dramatically ratcheted up the already intense pressure Maduro has been operating under in recent days.Already this week at least 16 people have been killed in street clashes between opposition supporters and security forces. The protests followed the arrest of about two dozen national guards reportedly for plotting to overthrow Maduro as rumours of mounting discontent within the military continue to feed expectations that the army’s long alliance with chavismo might be unravelling.The decision by the Trump administration to quickly recognise Guaidó as president is Washington’s most direct intervention in Venezuela’s internal affairs since it backed a botched coup against Maduro’s predecessor and chavismo founder Hugo Chávez in 2002. That experience left US policy-makers bruised after the putsch fizzled out within two days in the face of massive street protests and, once restored to power, Chávez entered into a close alliance with Cuba’s communist regime.But though chavismo has over the decades used the hostility of Washington to rally support at home and around the region, now it is the one looking isolated. A political sea-change in recent years that has turned South America’s political map from red to blue has seen countries once resolutely non-interventionist, when not openly allied with Caracas, increasingly willing to confront the Maduro regime.US recognition of Guaidó was swiftly followed by a majority of South American states, including both Brazil and Argentina, who until a few years ago were both led by left-wing allies of chavismo but are now under right-wing administrations that have openly called for Maduro to quit and democracy to be restored.Caracas responded to Washington’s support of Guaidó by severing relations and ordering its diplomats to leave the country within 72 hours, an order Washington refuses to recognise. The move reflected the Venezuelan regime’s confrontational approach to threats against it, but also the fact it still has powerful strategic allies.Russia strongly condemned the US move and warned it would result in “anarchy and a bloodbath”, while China declared its continuing support for efforts “to protect the country’s sovereignty, independence and stability”. Their backing for Maduro in part derives from the huge debts Caracas has run up with both Beijing and Moscow.The opposition has threatened not to recognise these obligations, which they denounce as illegitimate.In recent months, Moscow has emerged as Caracas’s lender of last resort after Venezuela was declared in default on about $60 billion (€52.9 billion) of its debt by international ratings agencies. Meanwhile, China reined back on its own lending, which already amounts to tens of billions of dollars, as it became concerned about its ability to ever recoup the cash.Those fears stem from the fact that despite having the world’s largest oil reserves, Venezuela’s economy is in ruins after a disastrous 20-year experiment in Hugo Chávez’s so-called “21st Century Socialism” that has left much of the population hungry and caused a breakdown in public health. Mismanagement and rampant corruption have led to a collapse in oil production, the country’s one source of the foreign revenue needed for imports of food and medicines, provoking a brutal contraction in gross domestic product and hyperinflation.Already, millions of Venezuelans have fled abroad, but despite the unravelling of the country’s social fabric, the Maduro regime shows no signs that it is willing to step aside. Despite reports of discontent in the lower ranks, much of the top military brass is deeply compromised by the regime’s corruption, including drug trafficking, and is believed to be unwilling to take its chances with the opposition.On Thursday some of the country’s top military commanders took to the airwaves to express their loyalty to Maduro with some denouncing the opposition’s move as treason.And Maduro can still rely on the support of Cuba. Its intelligence and security personnel are a key prop to his regime, and expert in quashing plots and retaining power despite the backdrop of punishing regional hostility. The political storm raging in Caracas might be the worst in years – but expect Maduro and his Cuban minders to batten down the hatches and attempt to ride it out."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

He has just started school in rural Oxfordshire and is eagerly learning to read. “He’s taken to school like a duck to water. He loves it. He’s very sociable and good at making friends,” says his mother, Lydia. In other words, he is a very normal, happy little boy.Yet there is something remarkable about Isaac. His early progress through life has helped to set the standard for other children across the world. Isaac is one of more than 1,300 children in five countries – Brazil, India, Italy, Kenya and the UK – whose growth and neurodevelopment has been tracked and compared from the earliest days in the womb until the age of two.Led by a team at the University of Oxford, the INTERGROWTH-21st Project is set to have a profound impact on the way we view, feed and educate our children. It has shown for the first time that children are born physically and intellectually equal, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Given good living conditions, good food and education, babies thrive, wherever they live and whatever the colour of their skin.Such is the power of the data gathered, the researchers hope it will be used alongside the World Health Organisation’s growth charts worldwide, including its Red Book in the UK. It should finally put to bed outdated notions of racial or class-based superiority.The research tracks both physical and intellectual development to age two. A child’s first 1,000 days of life (from conception to 24 months) is the most crucial because that is when the brain grows fastest, accounting for roughly two-thirds of its adult weight.Isaac\u0026#39s mother, Lydia, says her son took to school like a duck to water. To her left is her 7-year-old son, Ethan.“At every single stage we’ve shown that healthy mothers have healthy babies, and that healthy babies all grow at exactly the same rate,” says Prof Stephen Kennedy, the co-director of the Oxford Maternal and Perinatal Health Institute and co-leader of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project (with José Villar, a professor of perinatal medicine). “It doesn’t matter where you are living, it doesn’t matter what the colour of your skin is, it doesn’t matter what your race and ethnicity is, receiving decent medical care and nutrition is the key.”The assertion that healthy mothers have healthy babies – regardless of where they come from – sounds obvious but demonstrating it in terms of growth and developmental milestones is a first.Until now, it was a commonly held view that some babies were naturally smaller than others due to genetic predisposition: a healthy baby born to a Kenyan mother, say, would be smaller than a counterpart born to a British mother. America’s National Institutes for Health even produced differing foetal growth charts for babies of white, black, and Asian origin.Assumptions have also – though more controversially – been made about the intellectual ability of different races. Only last week the Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory in the US cut its ties with James Watson, the Nobel Prize-winning geneticist who, with Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick, first proposed the double helix structure of DNA, citing his “unsubstantiated and reckless” remarks about race and intelligence. Watson, the laboratory’s former chancellor, has repeatedly suggested that genes cause a disparity in average scores in IQ tests between blacks and whites.Geneticist James Watson in 1962, accepting the Nobel prize he would later be stripped of.“There’s still a substantial body of opinion out there in both the scientific and lay communities who genuinely believe that intelligence is predominantly determined by genes and the environment that you’re living in and that your parents and grandparents were living in and their nutritional and health status are not relevant,” says Prof Kennedy. “Well, that’s clearly not the case.”The Oxford study took seven years to complete and involved nearly 60,000 mothers and babies in two stages of research, first tracking growth in the womb, before following more than 1,300 of those babies to age two. Its results show that not only physical growth but behaviour and neurodevelopmental milestones occur at the same rate among babies of differing ethnic origin. The findings echo the assertion by Craig Venter, the scientist who led the first draft of the sequencing of the human genome, that “there is no basis in scientific fact or in the human genetic code or the notion that skin colour will be a predictive of intelligence”.Previous research into gestational growth has taken ethnic origin but not living conditions into account. Where mothers of a similar social, economic and health status are compared, the Oxford team has shown, healthy Indian and African babies will grow at the same rate as healthy, well-nourished Britons. The women enrolled into the second part of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project – whether in Brazil, India, Italy, Kenya or Oxford in the UK – were carefully selected to achieve a like-for-like comparison: urban women of similar age with a healthy BMI who were non-smokers and living in a clean environment. “It is important to say these were not superwomen, they were simply well-educated and well-nourished,” says Kennedy. “In the centres we selected, one-third of the women met our criteria for being healthy. So this wasn’t a tiny slice of the population.”Babies were weighed and measured (including head circumference) at birth, then at one and two years of age. The team tracked fundamental motor milestones according to WHO norms, such as the age at which the child first stood or walked alone, but also developed its own, culturally neutral set of tests  for cognition, language, behaviour and motor development.At the age of two, the children were given a series of play-related tasks. “You might build a tower using five blocks, then knock it down,” says Dr Michelle Fernandes, the Oxford researcher who devised the tests. “Will the child respond by building another tower, completely or partially, or make no effort to do so? If you place a number of objects in front of the child – a cup, spoon, sock, shoe and cube – and ask them to put the spoon in the cup, without giving them a visual cue, are they able to do so?”Michelle Fernandes, an Oxford researcher who developed tests to measure a baby\u0026#39s visual acuity, attention  and language development.Cognitive development was also assessed by placing an attractive object under one cloth, then another, then asking the child to find it. If the child immediately lifted the second cloth, it showed they had been able to follow the sequence of moves. “There are no zero scores,” says Dr Fernandes, “because the child is always able to do something, whether it is building a tower, but with only three blocks, or searching for the beads under the first cloth.”Additional information on the children’s behavioural progress, including lavatory training, was obtained by questioning the mothers.In 1995, the WHO decided that human growth and development should be assessed and monitored using international standards. The resulting standards, published in 2006, form the basis of the Red Book familiar to families in Britain whose babies’ growth is assessed in centiles in relation to the graph.The WHO standard applied to children aged 0-5 (born at full-term) but did not study the foetus. The Oxford study fills in the gap, charting children’s progress from the earliest weeks of life. “By assessing not only growth but neurodevelopment at two years of age we have done something the WHO didn’t,” says Prof Kennedy.“Our standards for establishing gestational age, monitoring the growth of the foetus, assessing the newborn size and post-natal growth on preterm babies... all of those overlap and complement the WHO standards. Taken together, they provide a gold standard which should be used by every country in the world.”The INTERGROWTH-21st standards are likely to focus doctors’ – and hopefully parents’ – attention on the quality of food pregnant women and young infants consume. While the study shows all children should grow up equally able, it is a lack of good nutrition in the first thousand days that is likely to make the biggest difference to a child’s future.Across the world, there are estimated to be more than 150 million children (22 per cent) who have become physically and mentally “stunted” because of poor nutrition in their early years. Although largely an overseas problem, recent international data showed that 10 per cent of UK children live in conditions of “severe food insecurity”.Just as problematic, worrying numbers of babies are born overweight, putting them at risk of health problems including diabetes later in life. A report from the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health this week flags up concern over child poverty in the UK – a contributory factor in childhood obesity and poor mental health – and the UK’s poor rate of breastfeeding, believed to be among the lowest in the world. The UK infant feeding survey, usually carried out every five years, was cancelled in 2015.The Oxford team is now launching a new study, INTERPRACTICE-21st, to examine the growth and development of preterm babies. It has been normal practice to monitor those babies born below 32 weeks of gestation, but it is assumed those born between 33 and 37 weeks, though early, will “catch up”. It may be that any baby born early is at risk of developmental delay.The INTERGROWTH-21st Project has come to an end but its findings convey a powerful message about what can be achieved worldwide if mothers and babies have access to good food, education and a decent environment. In such circumstances, the attainment of neurodevelopmental milestones and associated behaviours “are likely innate and universal” the researchers say: and that commonality must be good news for us all.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityNewsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleUniversity of OxfordBrexit latest news: Philip Hammond refuses to resign over \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitComment: Stick with May or risk a backstop and Corbyn?

They had been at the venue for 14 hours when they decided to use the facility’s water park.There was no staff to direct anyone on the slides but I\u0027d told my two young children to wait 10 seconds between each other so they could get out of the way,” she said.My daughter was supposed to follow me down afterwards but instead a overweight woman came down the slide just moments after me.”She said she had reached the bottom of the slide but could not move in time, resulting in her being “thrown backwards in the water, and my eyes were rolling back into my head”.I was coming in and out of conscious as the pain was so severe,” she said.Ms Joslyn, a health care assistant from Seaford, East Sussex, required emergency surgery at  Esnaf Hospital in Fethiye, Turkey, to treat a split liver, internal bleeding and severe kidney damage.She is now taking legal action against Thomas Cook after claiming that there were no safety precautions in place at the hotel to monitor who was coming down the slide and that her aftercare was “appalling”.Thomas Cook weren\u0027t helpful at all - they didn\u0027t bother to find out where I was, where my kids were and I was left to sort out my own care,” she said.Jemma claims she was then told her insurance didn\u0027t cover the hospital care as she had been taken to a private hospital, which her friend paid for.She added: No extra support was offered and my mum, 59 had to plead with Thomas Cook to get both herself and my dad, 76, to Turkey.”A spokesman for Thomas Cook said: Both our UK-based welfare team and our in-resort team have been in touch with Ms Joslyn on several occasions following this accident.We also arranged for her parents to fly to Turkey to be with their daughter.Solicitor Magdalena Knez, from Slater and Gordon, who is representing Ms Joslyn’s legal case, said: We are waiting on a further response and are hopeful we will have a successful outcome for Jemma who has been through a very traumatic experience.Brexit latest news: Philip Hammond refuses to resign over \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitComment: Stick with May or risk a backstop and Corbyn?

The work has been attributed to BanksyA man wearing a storm trooper costume holds a sketchbook belonging to costume designer John Mollo, and showing illustrations for Star Wars costumes, during a photo-call ahead of an auction at Bonhams in central LondonNicola Dandridge, chief executive of the OfS, has condemned the use of “conditional unconditional offers”,\u0026nbspwhich only become unconditional if an applicant makes the university their first choice.Data in the report shows that no conditional unconditional offers were detected in 2013, but more than 66,000 were made to 18-year-olds in 2018.“We are concerned about the rapid rise in unconditional offers, particularly those with strings attached which are akin to pressure selling,” Ms Dandridge said. “It is plainly not in students’ interests to push them to accept an offer that may not be their best option.”She added that universities should be encouraging students to make the decision that is right for them and “not the decision that best suits the university”.“If we identify cases where unconditional offers are having an obvious negative impact on students’ choices or outcomes, we are of course prepared to intervene,” Ms Dandridge warned.The higher education regulator can impose formal sanctions like financial penalties, suspension from the Office for Students register or deregistration in the most extreme cases.One in three students offered degree place regardless of exam gradesUniversities that are deregistered would lose access to public funding for teaching and their students would no longer be able to get loans. They also risk losing their degree-awarding powers and title.Damian Hinds, the education secretary, had called on the OfS to use the full range of its powers against universities that cannot justify the rising numbers of unconditional offers being made.Mr Hinds said: “The steep rise in unconditional offers across a wide range of subjects is disturbing, and I believe that widespread use of these offers is not in the best interests of students, who should be encouraged to reach their full potential.”University ditches unconditional offers in bid to ‘maintain standards’‘Unconditional offers could lead to drop in top A-level grades’One in four teenagers handed university offer without gradesHe added: “What I find particularly concerning is the OfS’s finding of how many of those accepting unconditional offers then miss their predicted A-level grades, because if university didn’t work out for that student it is those A-level grades they would fall back on.“That’s why I am urging universities to use their offers responsibly and not just use unconditional offers to get students through the door.”The research also shows that applicants from areas with the lowest higher education participation rates are more likely to receive an unconditional offer than their peers – as they are applying to universities which offer more places on degree courses regardless of A-level grades.Chris Millward, director for fair access and participation at the OfS, added: “Our analysis suggests that more unconditional offers may be being made to students from underrepresented groups to meet the needs of universities rather than students.”A Universities UK spokesperson said: “We do not yet have a full picture on the impact of unconditional offers on the students who receive them.“While initial evidence suggests that some students with unconditional offers achieve below their predicted A-level grades, these offers are also more likely to be made to applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds, and can impact positively on these iniduals’ mindsets as they approach life at university.”Office for StudentsOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

Anger over poor social conditions grew so intense that it provoked a riot in the late 1990s. A local social activist who objected to youths smashing bottles on the road and handed a bin bag full of broken glass to the mother of one of those responsible\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbsphe had bricks thrown at his house and firecrackers pushed through the letterbox.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisWhat turned Thanington round was substantial aid from the European Union.Paul Todd, a former resident who works on housing and homelessness issues, says:\u0026nbsp“About 20 years ago it was regenerated when it got a large dose of money out of the European regeneration budget.” The funding was used to make extensive renovations such as putting new roofs on the council houses and renewing bathrooms and bedrooms so the homes of council tenants looked better than those privately owned. In addition, the\u0026nbspregeneration money funded a community centre, known locally as the Resource Centre, which provides space for sports and recreation, as well as accommodation for children doing homework which they could not do at home.Paula Spencer, who has managed the centre since it was built, adds that the EU “spent £2.5m in doing up the estate and getting rid of the rat-runs. It used to be that they would nick your video machine and disappear down an alleyway.” Crime and antisocial behaviour dropped by 50 per cent as the regeneration measures took effect. As a newly arrived council tenant, Heggie says that she had been worried by the crossbow bolt incident but “apart from one broken car window on my driveway I have had no trouble since”.Created with Sketch.

A police officer speaks with anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayPolice surround a pro-Brexit protester after he confronted a pro-European protester Conservative MP David Davies, wearing a gopro camera, speaks to anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayThe EU intervention enabled Thanington – which I previously featured in the first instalment of this series – to lose its nickname of “Little Beirut”, but its residents complain that they have lacked public investment ever since, and that this is beginning to show. The 2,794 people who live there work mostly in low-wage jobs, often as cleaners or in supermarkets in and around Canterbury, or they are on benefits. Educational standards are low, illiteracy is high, and many single-parent families are headed by women. Nevertheless, residents and outside observers agree that Thanington retains a strong sense of communal solidarity.“It’s largely retained its village identity,” says Todd, whose relatives still live there and who has great affection for its people. “Everyone knows everyone else’s business.”\u0026nbspOver the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant. Then there was the shootingThe only state institution to help preserve this small and vulnerable community was the EU, so it is worth asking why so many of those living in Thanington voted Leave\u0026nbspin the 2016 referendum. At first glance, their actions, repeated in many deprived areas receiving EU funds in England and Wales, appear to be an inexplicable example of social and economic self-harm. Nevertheless, it was probably the high Leave\u0026nbspvotes in deprived white housing estates which tipped the balance towards Britain voting for Brexit. So it is important to discover why people from such places voted as they did in such overwhelming numbers. Was it a vote very much determined by opposition to immigration, or was it a more general protest by the “left-behinds”\u0026nbspand the “left-outs”? \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMost people in Thanington voted for Britain to leave the EU, and they did so because they are poor and feel neglected, according to Todd, who has known the area for 30 years. He says that there is an “assumption there that immigration has affected their prospects. I don’t think people are aware of how much Thanington did benefit from the EU. The European regeneration money certainly made a huge impact on the quality of the housing stock up there. It probably gave some of the houses another chance, otherwise they might have been knocked down. Some people want immigration cut and others think that talk of another referendum is an indicator that their concerns haven’t been taken seriously.”Bellas did not mention and may not have known about the EU regeneration effort which happened before he started living on the estate after years of homelessness and holding insecure jobs. In any case, the impact of that funding is running out and there are signs of growing decrepitude and insecurity.\u0026nbsp“It’s quite a deprived area,” he says. “There’s a lot of people with drug problems and\u0026nbspalcohol issues, and they seem to be moving families in who have already been evicted from homes because of antisocial behaviour. Everyone’s got a right to live anywhere but it doesn’t do great things for the estate.“Over the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant – ‘you’re going to sell this for us’\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa lot of guys in Mercedes,\u0026nbspreal high-end saloons,\u0026nbspwho don’t fit on the estate. Then there was the shooting in the summer, which was a direct result of these guys coming down from London and that happened just around the corner from us.”Created with Sketch.

Our kids don’t play out on the street. I know all my neighbours and I know all their kids, but it’s really difficult because there are people from off the estate come to sell their drugs that I don’t know. We had a heroin dealer set up in the house next door to us and for about six weeks, we had people knocking on our door coming to pick up their drugs up and it took 50 phone calls to the police to get them to sort it out.”The shooting Bellas refers to took place on 19 July last year when\u0026nbsptwo men in balaclavas shot and seriously wounded Danny Mobey in Thanington’s Godwin Road.Bellas voted Leave in the referendum, denying that this had anything to do with immigration and saying that his decision was more to do with democracy and resistance to power being devolved to a centralised European government and unelected officials making decisions on his behalf. He says: “I just feel that there is something quite sinister and secret about a federal government.”About the economic consequences of departure from the EU, he is optimistic, arguing that the Germans, French and Spanish will want to go on selling goods to Britain. He says that a lot of people he knows had voted Leave influenced by “the Brexiteers’ promise that there would be £350m\u0026nbspextra for the NHS”.\u0026nbspHis two biggest concerns are the lack of policing and the decline of the NHS, where his wife works as a nurse, and which he fears the government wants to privatise.Even in a place as small as Thanington, perceptions of violence vary markedly from street to street and person to person. Di Hutchinson agrees that things are getting worse: “I was ill last Christmas and I saw a drug deal going down and I was shocked because it was the first time I’d ever seen it.” Overall, however, residents and outside observers say that Thanington is no worse than other housing estates and other areas of deprivation anywhere in UK. (There are more affluent parts of the district away from the estate.)People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhereFinancial aid from the EU and other advantages stemming from membership had little effect on poor Leave voters in 2016. Either the EU’s achievements were under-publicised, or – and this is probably the crucial factor – whatever the EU did was not enough to counterbalance a pervasive sense among millions of voters that their lives are getting more pressured and insecure. This was as true in east Kent as it was in Cornwall, an example of ingratitude for EU largesse often cited. That county has a population of 530,000 and received €654m\u0026nbsp(£574m) from the EU between 2007 and 2013. It was due to receive another €600m before 2020, yet 54.5 per cent voted Leave.Fear of immigration was probably the most important factor in the way people voted, but so too was the privatisation and outsourcing of utitlities and services, job insecurity, decline in real wages, high rents, deindustrialisation and a lack of cheap transport. The EU and its supporters can justly complain that Brussels is being unfairly scapegoated for failings that it has\u0026nbspnothing to do with, and which\u0026nbspshould be blamed rather on globalisation, privatisation and the austerity policies pursued by Conservative governments.Yet, even if the EU is not responsible, this does not mean that the deep discontent\u0026nbsprevealed by the referendum result is\u0026nbspnot real. Simply put, Brexit is a symptom as well as a cause of the crisis which has enveloped Britain and envenomed its politics. The ill-considered Remain slogan of 2016 – “Better Together” –\u0026nbspwas never going to resonate with those whose standard of living had stagnated or deteriorated over the past decade despite Britain being in the EU. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAusterity may have driven homelessness rise, minister admitsTransport is already scarce: according to Spencer, it takes two bus trips to get to the nearest doctor, while there is only one bus every two hours in the evening. A planned new exit from the A2, which is being contested by local residents, will make Thanington even more isolated from the rest of Canterbury than it is at present. And as houses become more expensive and cost far more than the present population on their low-paying jobs can afford, the traditional community will break up as parents find that their children have to move off the estate if they want find anywhere cheap enough to live.Even more seriously, the insecure low-paid work done by many in Thanington does not provide enough to pay rent and food. The result is reliance on food banks and free school meals. Caroline Heggie says that people are becoming more and more indebted “because now you’ve got companies giving out credit cards to people with low credit ratings”.A telling sign of the growing deprivation in Thanington – and the sort of event which may explain why people there failed to endorse the status quo in 2016 – is a recent plague of rats.“People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhere,” says Spencer. The origin of the rat infestation is unclear: it may be that rats were disturbed by the new housing construction in nearby fields, or that the council no longer deals with rubbish that has been left to pile up. Cuts in public services of all kinds have hit Thanington hard, and services dropped include pest control.A rat catcher charges £60, which tenants must now pay themselves though there may be 10 or 12 rats to be disposed of, necessitating more than one visit.\u0026nbspHeggie says: “You used to have council ‘rat people’, but because of austerity, you don’t have them anymore.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It preys on those who have the home ownership dream, keen to avoid paying sky-high rents.This erse group s bankers, media types, public sector and office workers, alongside retirees. Some have lived in the area long before its re-development and gentrification. While it might be difficult to shed a tear for those fortunate enough to have bought in such a sought-after location, these people have in fact found common cause with a group of northern working-class mums, who last year established the National Leasehold Campaign (NLC) to tackle similar issues.Rent arrears more than double under universal credit, figures showFrom newbuild houses on private estates across the northwest, to fancy flats in the shiny residential towers crowding the Isle of Dogs, properties originally marketed as offering ‘home ownership’ are uniting people up and down the country in a shared concern.As London expands and demand for homes across the southeast continues to grow, developers are building ever higher and at much greater densities. Leasehold tenure is exploding as more and more flats are constructed.\u0026nbspUnfortunately, many of\u0026nbspthose who do manage to leave the rental market, proudly brandishing the keys to their new home, fail to understand what leasehold means until it’s too late.When you “buy”\u0026nbspa leasehold flat, you are buying the right to occupy it for a certain length of time. Think of it as a long-term rental, with the minimum term 99 years. You pay most of this upfront. You’ll probably have to take out a mortgage to cover the purchase costs.\u0026nbspBut it’s not ‘yours’.\u0026nbspYou don’t own the flat, the building, or any of the land on which it sits.\u0026nbspYou have effectively signed up to become a renter with a mortgage.\u0026nbspEven the law calls you a tenant.The landowner, known as the freeholder, nominally owns the building and is your landlord. He or she will appoint a managing agent to run the estate, often on a\u0026nbspcommission basis. The freeholder\u0026nbspenjoys an annual ground rent from you, which is essentially\u0026nbspprofit, unconnected to services that might be provided to tenants (cleaning of communal areas, for instance), which also come at a cost.Through control of the managing agent, the landlord can choose how high the service charges are set (although the law states that charges must be ‘reasonable’). And he has the all-important power to award contracts to anyone he chooses to undertake works, irrespective of the cost, quality or (say critics) even necessity of the job. But you have to pick up the tab. Every time.\u0026nbspThere are short and long leases, with leases running down to below the 80-year mark deeply unattractive and hard to remortgage.Although your charming estate agent may suggest that a 999-year lease is as good as owning the property outright, this is still a glorified tenancy.\u0026nbspYou will still have to deal with a landlord and his agents\u0026nbspwhen things go wrong.The landlord has the all-important power to award contracts to anyone he chooses, irrespective of the cost, quality or even necessity of the job. But you have to pick up the tab“Recently we have seen an erroneous narrative being propagated that freeholders are ‘noble custodians’ of the building and\u0026nbspserve some valuable service to the leaseholders. Nothing could be further from the truth,” says Louie Burns, managing director of Leasehold Solutions. He describes them as an asset class, using feudal property laws to make themselves owners of the buildings by proxy. “They own the buildings to make as much money as they possibly can from them,” he adds. “It shames us as a nation that this feudal, iniquitous system is still thriving in the 21st century when the rest of the world have rid themselves from it.”But how could such an unjust system come into being in the first place? Home ownership falls more in UK than any other EU countryAfter seizing all land in the name of the crown, and under threat from the landowners he had just dispossessed, the new King William I had to act fast to stay in power. The year was 1067. He consolidated his regime by gifting some of his land to a highly select group of people. These palace favourites, the lords, rushed to break the freehold land into tiny parcels\u0026nbspand sell them on as leases to lesser men\u0026nbspfor agrarian use. The\u0026nbspinnovation allowed for a perpetual form of land ownership. Leasehold would continue to shape patterns of class formation in early modern England, becoming a key instrument of capital accumulation for the wealthy during the industrial revolution. As people deserted the countryside for the cities, the descendants of William the Conqueror’s noble class\u0026nbspwere uniquely well placed to seize the opportunities of this new era. With their monopoly on land, they introduced “building leases”\u0026nbspto allow for the building of flats on their estates. Hard-working people became glorified tenants, with\u0026nbspfreeholders gorging on the ground rents, license and permission fees, building insurance and maintenance charges. Fast-forward 200\u0026nbspyears, and little has changed.With nine\u0026nbspout of 10 newbuild properties being sold as leasehold in London today, this is a rigged market. If you want a flat, it almost has to be leasehold. Although there is an established co-operative mode of property ownership for flats, “share of freehold”, this has been shunned by developers and investors as it offers none of the lucrative opportunities that they enjoy with leasehold.A newer, more advanced form of tenure, “commonhold”, made the statute books in the early 2000s. Commonholders, unlike leaseholders, would own their flats outright and, through an association, own and manage the common areas collectively. With no third-party landlord, residents would be in the driving seat. They would appoint the managing agent. Curiously, London has just one commonhold scheme in existence.Although it was assumed that commonhold would ultimately\u0026nbspmake leasehold obsolete, as savvy buyers sought\u0026nbsptrue home ownership, it never took root because of vested interests and poorly drafted legislation. Conservative MP Crispin Blunt blames leaving it to the market. By splitting the land into freehold and leasehold interests, developers can sell leasehold properties to unsuspecting buyers, pocketing the ground rents through their continued ownership of the freehold, and make a fortune in the process. Still not satisfied, many choose to sell on the freehold to faceless offshore investors. What to Look for When Buying Within a Development“Profit making businesses such as housing developers cannot be expected\u0026nbspto freely and voluntarily disclose their own ‘monetisation maximisation’ model,”\u0026nbspBlunt says.The MP’s intervention raises questions about our democratic politics. Twenty years after\u0026nbspgovernment described the leasehold system as “flawed to its roots”, the question remains:\u0026nbspwhy haven’t we killed it\u0026nbspoff yet? Is the corporate lobbyist really more powerful than the consumer homebuyer?There is growing anger from leaseholders in flats who want to be free of “hold”.\u0026nbspWe hear their stories at the Isle of Dogs beer garden. They have suffered in silence for many years and paid the service charges without question. Yet because these increased\u0026nbspmodestly each year, leaseholders often didn’t know\u0026nbspwhat was happening until they found themselves struggling to sell their leases on the open market. Their home was a depreciating asset all along, even with a residential tenure supposed to last a millennium. The financial nightmare gets even worse when buildings are left to deteriorate –\u0026nbspthe condition of tower blocks has little to no impact on the value of the freehold title or associated ground rent portfolio. The freehold landlord has bought a cash machine. He doesn’t need to worry about keeping the leaseholders happy.And those leaseholders who went\u0026nbsppublic with their experience in the past risked\u0026nbspangering their neighbours, who did\u0026nbspnot want to see the value of their homes affected by negative publicity\u0026nbspsome faced threats of legal action from the freehold landlord. And when your landlord controls every element of the way your block is run, right down to whether your windows get cleaned, it is understandable that many people preferred to stay\u0026nbspquiet.Unsuspecting first-time buyers signed leases with toxic doubling ground rent clauses.\u0026nbspWhen they wanted to buy the freehold, they found it had been sold on to shadowy offshore investors\u0026nbspThings changed when the big developers applied the leasehold model to houses, many of which were made available through the government’s Help to Buy scheme. They targeted the northwest, where 69 per cent\u0026nbspof houses sold in 2016 were leasehold. Unsuspecting first-time buyers signed leases with toxic doubling ground rent clauses. And when they wanted to buy the freehold, they found it had been sold on to shadowy\u0026nbspinvestors who had either taken it off the market or quadrupled the cost.Trapped in unsellable, newbuild leasehold houses, three brave women decided to take on the industry and government. They wielded placards outside new housing developments that were being sold off-plan, warning prospective buyers to avoid leasehold products. They even had themselves chained up as they sat in mock prison cells. Politicians and the media started taking notice, with the wider “fake home ownership”\u0026nbspscandal coming under scrutiny.Half of leasehold house owners didn’t know what they were buyingJoanne Darbyshire, a co-founder of the NLC, says the campaign moved quickly to broaden its reach by articulating the experiences of leaseholders in flats. “It didn’t take long for us to realise that the leasehold scandal was so much more than leasehold newbuild houses,” she says.\u0026nbsp“Newbuild flats were also being sold with onerous ground rent terms and we learnt about the immoral and unethical behaviour of a number of freeholders. We knew the NLC had to campaign for all leaseholders.”With more than 12,000 people now part of the NLC Facebook group, which is being used to direct leaseholders to complete consultations on reform, Darbyshire and her fellow campaigners are giving those who live in flats a newfound confidence to stand up and be counted. After the northwest, London is the next highest represented area on the NLC.Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick, whose constituents are attempting to overcome collective action problems with Friends in High Places, says: “Whether it is spiralling service charges, inflated refurbishment costs, fraudulent insurance premiums, obstructing residents’ associations being formed or various other ways to cheat decent residents, including forfeiture, the rules have to change.” His Poplar and Limehouse constituency has the second highest number of leasehold properties in the country, after the City\u0026nbspof London and City of Westminster. In 2016, Poplar and Limehouse saw the highest number of leasehold properties sold across England and Wales, at 97 per cent.Whether it is spiralling service charges, inflated refurbishment costs, fraudulent insurance premiums, or various other ways to cheat decent residents, including forfeiture, the rules have to changeAnxious to ease the housing crisis, Tower Hamlets council is\u0026nbspapproving leasehold developments all the time. It\u0026nbspdid not respond to requests for data on what some have identified as a new, more disturbing trend within the murky world of leasehold. The emergence of mixed-use schemes, where squeezed local authority and prospective buyer are enticed by the prospect of building a new school, doctors’ surgery, bars, restaurants and shops under newbuild flats, demonstrates the way leasehold is taking over. Where buildings are over 25 per cent\u0026nbspnon-residential, developers have artfully curtailed residential rights to almost nothing.An investor who gains the freehold of a mixed-use building can use his total control of the service charges from the residential floors to subsidise his commercial operations. Of course he’s not supposed to do this, but the ease with which service charge accounts can be delayed and fudged, and residential spending conflated with commercial makes it a temptation few will resist. If you don’t need to pick up the tab, why would you?The freehold landlord is safe in the knowledge that while\u0026nbspleaseholders theoretically hold the power to win disputes at\u0026nbspthe property tribunal, the chances of them finding the time and resources to cobble a case together against him are slim. People have lives, families, jobs. How many can dedicate the months, if not years, a legal battle can take? And why should a flat dweller have to go to court to force his landlord to clean his windows or repair his lifts or employ decent door staff for a reasonable cost? Especially when that landlord can bill him through the service charge for his own legal costs. Yes, go to the tribunal and if you lose you cold pay both sides’ legal costs. Think of that playground game where the bully forces his victim to smack himself round his own face and you’ve pretty much got the leaseholder’s plight.And to top it all off, the tribunal is not even a court equivalent. According to Christopher Howarth, a senior researcher working in the House of Commons:\u0026nbsp“It does not have the time or interest for long and complex cases, does not take evidence on oath and is easily swayed by the legal firepower at the disposal of large landlords.”Lacking the ability to break free of “hold”\u0026nbspby buying out the freeholder, through a process known as enfranchisement, and also barred from the Right to Manage (RTM), a way of cutting out the landlord by making the managing agent accountable to leaseholders only, flat dwellers in mixed-use developments are in a special kind of leasehold hell.The Law Commission, which has been tasked by government to review the law on enfranchisement to make it “easier, cheaper and quicker”, claims there is no need to change the arbitrary 25 per cent\u0026nbsprule. As developers move away from buildings that are predominantly residential, officials seem to be turning a blind eye to the fact that many more families and young people are set to fall into the leasehold property trap. The Law Commission has been\u0026nbspinviting views on its enfranchisement. Leaseholders will certainly be kept busy, with a commission spokesperson confirming that “the Right to Manage consultation paper will be published in early 2019, and the consultation will last for two months”.They say reform is on its way. But John Paterson, a veteran leasehold campaigner, is not hopeful. He says the government has known about the outrageous racket of leasehold housing since the 1980s. But there has been no meaningful change.High hopes for rent-to-own clampdown but UK’s poorest will struggleX Factor finalists’ house for rent for £12.5k a monthWhat’s next for Generation Rent?Paterson feels sure he knows where this latest chapter will end. “The government likes to stick with 1925 Law of Property and the idea of caveat emptor.\u0026nbspIt will consider that it has warned of the problems of leasehold tenure and, therefore, if iniduals fail to heed these warnings it is their own fault.”Paterson is not far off. The current administration seems content to sit back and watch existing leaseholders face surging ground rents. It hides behind the argument that intervention would set a ‘dangerous’ precedent. However, they are not warning of the problems of applying leasehold to flats. If anything, they have embarked on “Project Save Leasehold”. While\u0026nbspThatcher, Major and Blair envisaged the end of leasehold, May’s administration defends the feudal system. The ruling party sees a cross-class alliance conspiring to bring it down –\u0026nbspand it doesn’t like it. Just last month, Heather Wheeler, the minister for housing and homelessness, claimed in parliament that “leasehold can be an effective tool for making multiple-ownership more straightforward”. Within minutes, her claim was ridiculed online. In surprising numbers, leaseholders were citing US condominium and Australian strata-title as superior models to the leasehold regime.Wheeler’s colleague, the housing secretary James Brokenshire, has demonstrated his personal commitment to “Project Save Leasehold”. He is engaging in what campaigners have called “death-by-consultation”. Not only that, he is actively sabotaging the plans of his predecessor, Sajid Javid. Private Eye says choosing to set ground rents on new leases at £10, as opposed to making them zero financial value, will ensure leasehold persists.With a housing target of 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s, existing leaseholders are pained at the thought of yet more innocent homebuyers falling into the leasehold property trap.\u0026nbspAs a party which\u0026nbspsays it is\u0026nbspcommitted to the principle of home ownership, it is ironic that the Conservatives are effectively\u0026nbspforbidding young people from owning their own homes by allowing flats to be sold as tenancies. England and Wales are the only countries left that have this feudal system. In failing to act against this burning injustice, the Conservative Party may very well be signing its death warrant.Back in the Isle of Dogs beer garden, leaseholders mention a new development going up. They call it “Desmond Town”. Richard Desmond, the ex-press baron, wants to create an income stream of more than 1,500 new homes. There will be a new secondary school, healthcare services, lifestyle facilities, and restaurants and bars. Unfortunately, residents will have no way of buying him out. And if current rules stay the same, they will have no ability to get control of their building and service charges. As London Docklands continues to be a construction site, Friends in High Places has a huge fight on its\u0026nbsphands to end leasehold for good.help to buyOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth.

It\u0027s the only distillery on the Isle of Skye and sits right on the beach of Loch Harport.After a glass or two of this you\u0027ll feel as though  you\u0027ve been drinking a whisky-fuelled bonfire on a beach. Its rich and peaty notes blend perfectly with a peppery smokiness. Rémy Cointreau bought this Hebri- dean distillery last year and its  unpeated Laddie Ten is a perfect antidote to the usual Islay spirits. Laphroaig has a full body and  a fearsome reputation but it\u0027s  surprisingly sweet with hints of  salt and layers of peatiness in this 10-year-old vintage. From Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, this whisky is a truly medicinal tipple. Sweet and peaty on the nose, it has a rounded and smoky favour with a long, peppery finish. James Bond drinks this stuff so it must be good. Right? Regardless of the product placement, this gets a hearty recommendation for its sweet molasses taste. This distillery in Wick turns out  excellent whiskies. Perfect with  seafood, it has a complex nose of green apples and spices.The latest expression from Glenlivet, which replaces its 12-year-old and is aimed at paying tribute to the distillery\u0027s founder George Smith. Just like the earliest bottles from Glenlivet, there are no age statements, meaning it can be pulled from different aged casks. A smooth and fruity dram with a hint of sweetness.Dalwhinnie\u0027s distillery is the highest in Scotland. It turns out a balanced malt with a sherry character and just a hint of silky honey and Highland heather. Fresh and sweet Caol Ila is a straw-coloured Islay whisky for the drinker who likes complex flavours. It has a fruity nose of clean, crisp flavours before a salty and a peaty kick.Talisker is fiery stuff that tastes like it\u0027s been made by the sea, and with good reason. It\u0027s the only distillery on the Isle of Skye and sits right on the beach of Loch Harport.After a glass or two of this you\u0027ll feel as though  you\u0027ve been drinking a whisky-fuelled bonfire on a beach. Its rich and peaty notes blend perfectly with a peppery smokiness. Rémy Cointreau bought this Hebri- dean distillery last year and its  unpeated Laddie Ten is a perfect antidote to the usual Islay spirits. Laphroaig has a full body and  a fearsome reputation but it\u0027s  surprisingly sweet with hints of  salt and layers of peatiness in this 10-year-old vintage. From Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, this whisky is a truly medicinal tipple. Sweet and peaty on the nose, it has a rounded and smoky favour with a long, peppery finish. James Bond drinks this stuff so it must be good. Right? Regardless of the product placement, this gets a hearty recommendation for its sweet molasses taste. This distillery in Wick turns out  excellent whiskies. Perfect with  seafood, it has a complex nose of green apples and spices.The latest expression from Glenlivet, which replaces its 12-year-old and is aimed at paying tribute to the distillery\u0027s founder George Smith. Just like the earliest bottles from Glenlivet, there are no age statements, meaning it can be pulled from different aged casks. A smooth and fruity dram with a hint of sweetness.Dalwhinnie\u0027s distillery is the highest in Scotland. It turns out a balanced malt with a sherry character and just a hint of silky honey and Highland heather.

Burns’s body was later transferred from a churchyard grave to a mausoleum in Dumfries, where his wife Jean Armour was also laid to rest after her death in 1834.When is Burns Night and how is it celebrated?Burns Night falls on 25 January every year to mark the poet’s birthday.The main attraction of Burns Night is the Burns Supper. This traditionally involves participants donning tartan, listening to bagpipes, crooning Auld Lang Syne –\u0026nbspalso sung at New Year’s Eve – and reciting the great writer’s songs and poems.\u0026nbspCelebrations commonly incorporate the Saltire, the national\u0026nbspflag of Scotland.\u0026nbspHow to address your haggis, courtesy of Robert BurnsWhile the first Burns Supper was first\u0026nbspheld way back in 1801 and new rituals have since been appended, the crux of the celebration remains\u0026nbspunchanged and revolves around paying tribute to Burns in whatever way feels most fitting.\u0026nbspWhat’s in the traditional dinner?The jewel in the crown of any Burns Supper is always haggis. For the uninitiated, haggis is a savoury pudding containing sheep’s heart, liver and lungs, which is minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, stock\u0026nbspand a selection of spices. It is traditionally bound in the animal’s stomach.\u0026nbspBurns\u0026nbspdescribes haggis as the “great chieftain o’ the puddin-‘race” and a traditional Burns Night kicks off with a host reading his\u0026nbsp“Address to a Haggis”.Haggis is served with the classic side of mashed neeps and tatties (swedes and potatoes).\u0026nbspThe food is, of course, accompanied by the finest domestic whisky.\u0026nbspVegetarians and pescetarians\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspor those who want to try something a little\u0026nbspdifferent – can choose haggis made without meat. Also popular is seafood dishes like Cullen Skink soup, made from smoked haddock.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

three separate attempts to\u0026nbspredraft leader’s strategy so it\u0026nbspties party unambiguously to giving UK a second voteClick to followIndy PoliticsJeremy Corbyn faces a revolt from Labour MPs backing a new Brexit referendum, who will launch a drive to rewrite his proposals for the next phase of withdrawal.The move from three MPs to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a Final Say referendum, once again thrusts the party’s deep Brexit isions into the spotlight.Hours earlier four other Labour MPs had joined Tory counterparts at a press conference, with one accusing Mr Corbyn of “standing in the way” of a people’s vote.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWhile Mr Corbyn’s office declined to comment on Thursday, the leader’s social media outriders launched a counter-attack on the Labour rebels whom they accused of dishonesty.Meanwhile doubt has emerged over the viability of a cross-party push by MPs to delay the UK’s withdrawal in order to avoid leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March.No-deal Brexit would be ‘betrayal’ of what was promised, says HammondAnd in Davos, chancellor Philip Hammond warned that a no-deal Brexit – something Theresa May has refused to rule out – would be a “betrayal” of the 2016 referendum result, underlining the split\u0026nbspat the heart of the Conservative cabinet.On Tuesday Ms May will give a statement and table a motion setting out the next steps of her Brexit plan, but because of previous measures approved in the Commons, all MPs will also be able to table amendments containing proposals for what they think the government should do next.Mr Corbyn has already submitted the Labour Party’s amendment, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign for a fresh referendum because it failed to fully commit the party to backing one.It would require ministers\u0026nbspto find time for MPs\u0026nbsponly to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.But The Independent understands three Labour MPs – Ian Murray, Angela Smith and Mike Gapes – have now taken the unusual step of tabling amendments to their own party leader’s amendment, in a bid to remould Mr Corbyn’s approach so it backs a new vote immediately.Mr Murray’s would commit the government to holding a referendum offering a choice between a Brexit deal that guarantees “full participation in the single market”, as previously promised by Labour, and remaining in the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote:

opportunity to have a final say” on leaving the EU, while Ms Smith’s would see ministers legislate for a vote on “whether or not the UK should leave”.The Independent has run its own Final Say campaign to try and secure a new referendum, with more than 1.1 million people having signed the petition.While neither Mr Corbyn’s amendment, nor the three amendments to it, stand much chance of being passed in\u0026nbspthe Commons, the joint push from Labour MPs speaks to a growing frustration on the party’s backbenchers over the ambiguity of the leader’s position as the Brexit clock ticks down to 29 March.At an event on the steps of parliament earlier in the day Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Is Brexit causing hundreds of companies to leave the UK?Ford warns no-deal Brexit would cost it $800m this year, report says Jeremy Corbyn, help give the British people a Final Say over BrexitLuciana Berger\u0026nbspsaid: “Regrettably the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy and yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Chuka Umunna, who was also at the event, argued that party politics should take a back seat, saying: “The choice is stark and there is no way of escaping from it or postponing making a decision because we are out of time – do you want to facilitate some form of Brexit or give people the power to stop it?”\u0026nbspMeanwhile,\u0026nbspChris Leslie told The Independent: “There really isn’t any excuse now for Labour not fulfilling the conference promise for a people’s vote. An election hasn’t been triggered, so we should be at that stage now.”Polling indicates Labour voters and members are in favour of a new vote, but the leadership has had to walk a fine line with many constituencies in heartland areas having heavily backed Brexit.A separate group of Labour MPs strongly oppose a new referendum, including frontbencher Melanie Onn, who wrote to her constituents saying she would quit her role in Mr Corbyn’s top team if the leadership did back a new vote.Following the event in the morning Corbyn-backing commentator Paul Mason said the intervention was “daft”, and accused the Labour rebels of “preparing a doomed centrist party”.Columnist Owen Jones argued that a second referendum amendment would not get through because Labour MPs in Leave seats and Tory MPs would oppose it.He added, addressing Mr Umunna on Twitter: “You either don’t know the facts or you’re being dishonest. Which is it?”The amendment that seems most likely to get thorough the Commons on Tuesday is that written by Labour’s Yvette Cooper, with cross-party backing, that seeks to extend Article 50, delaying Brexit to avoid a no-deal scenario.But concerns have emerged that legislation it requires to enact its aim\u0026nbspcould get bogged down and even blocked outright in the House of Lords.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are likely to back alternative motions that simply call for a public vote.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn has so far refused to agree to\u0026nbspMPs\u0027 and party members\u0027 demands that he\u0026nbspback a Final Say vote, but said the option should be considered by MPs.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspThe prime minister is both refusing to change her red lines or take the threat of a no deal exit off the table. MPs must now act to break the deadlock.Our amendment will allow MPs to vote on options to end this Brexit deadlock and prevent the chaos of a no deal.It is time for Labour\u0027s alternative plan to take centre stage, while keeping all options on the table, including the option of a public vote.Labour supporters of a fresh referendum welcomed the party\u0027s motion. Ben Bradshaw called it important progress and David Lammy tweeted: This is a big step foward. I hope this amendment can be the beginning of the end of years of argument over Berxit in this country.But while more than 70 Labour MPs have publicly called for another referendum, dozens of\u0026nbspothers are strongly opposed, including shadow ministers who would likely resign in order to vote against any proposal for going back to the public.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentSoon after the party\u0027s motion was tabled, shadow housing minister Melanie Onn announced that should would step down if she is ordered to vote for another referendum.In a letter to constituents, she wrote: I am not in favour of a People\u0027s Vote and will not vote for it. If it comes before parliament as it is expected to in the next few daysweeks, I will instead vote for a better \u0027Labour\u0027 deal.This may mean that I am required to step down from my frontbench housing role if it is a whipped vote. I would be very disappointed if this were the case, as I am very proud of the work I have been doing alongside John Healey and Sarah Jones, but recognise that I cannot vote against the frontbench and remain a part of it.Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u0027s\u0026nbspshadow business secretary, said the amendment would simply\u0026nbspwiden the debate and put all options on the table to avoid a no-deal scenario but that the party\u0027s priority remained securning\u0026nbspa different Brexit deal, including a customs union with the EU and a closer relationship with the\u0026nbspsingle market.\u0026nbspAsked if\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s motion\u0026nbspmakes a second referendum\u0026nbspmore likely,\u0026nbspshe told Sky News: Well, no. In line with our conference policy...our priority is to secure a deal\u0026nbspbut obviously all options need to remain on the table and that includes a public vote.She added: There\u0027s no\u0026nbspguarantee that it will pass even if our amendment passed\u0026nbspand certainly right across the Conservative Party\u0026nbspand in the Labour Party there\u0027s ided opinion as to whether a second referendum should be a preferred option at this stage.Ms Long-Bailey\u0026nbspsuggested that, even if its amendment passes, Labour would not necessarily instruct its MPs to vote for another referendum, saying: That\u0027s something that the party would need to decide at the time.\u0026nbspWith parliament still deadlocked over Brexit, former Conservative leader William Hague said a fresh public vote was now quite likely.Writing in the Daily , he said: It will probably produce only a narrow victory for either side despite a long struggle, and leave a wounded country to limp on afterwards.But it\u0027s coming, unless some extraordinary turn of events prevents it. It\u0027s coming by a process of elimination, not because it\u0027s a good idea in itself.MPs will vote on 29 January on amendments to Ms May\u0027s proposed plan.Commons home affairs committee chair Yvette Cooper has tabled a motion that would delay Brexit until the end of the year if no deal is in place by the end of February. With significant cross-party support, the motion is likely to pass if Labour agrees to support it.Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit commitee, has put down a separate amendment calling for MPs to hold a series of indicative votes on various Brexit outcomes.And Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, is expected to propose giving parliament to right to seize\u0026nbspcontrol of Brexit if the government cannot pass its deal.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a bid for power without a mandate.Shty Dominic Grieve fancies himself as a Remain superhero, outwitting the Government to rob .million voters.He doesn’t give a damn about the little people, of course, being a grand QC and former Attorney General.But Grieve is doing catastrophic harm to his party, to Parliament and our democracy. History won’t be kind to him.The Government he is destabilising is the only prayer Leavers have.Their betrayal by Labour is close, and inevitable.Labour’s Brexit chief Keir Starmer now admits that he aims to secure a second referendum — then campaign, and vote, for Remain.If that’s not Corbyn’s policy, why isn’t Starmer fired All the chaos brings Theresa May ever closer to an election.One in which every Tory Remainer plotting to kill Brexit must be deselected and replaced.With candidates who stay loyal to voters and make promises they intend to keep.SADIQ Khan’s “poll tax” on drivers looks like the biggest disaster of his inglorious tenure as London Mayor.We know he is a lightweight who prefers virtue-signalling to fixing the city’s problems. But this insane pollution charge could prove fatal to his prospects.Not only is his scheme, to hammer drivers in his Ultra Low Emissions Zone, vastly expensive to set up, it will barely improve air quality. All those who cannot replace their old car with a “cleaner” new model will be clobbered.Which of course hits the lowest-paid hardest. And, naturally, other left-wing councils nationwide are following suit.How very “progressive” it all is.NO ONE expects a flag-waving jamboree on the th anniversary of troops being deployed to Northern Ireland. But why would the MoD not mark it at all It is a snub of a piece with the hounding of veterans over their actions decades ago.It stems from a corrosive political correctness in modern politicians’ attitudes towards our role in the Troubles, where , troops died quelling the IRA’s campaign of slaughter.Labour may be led by pensioner revolutionaries who supported the terrorists.That’s no reason for the Tories to forget who the good guys were — and their bravery in securing the peace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m voluntarily withdrawing from their process.DANCING On Ice viewers can’t say they weren’t warned.“After the break,” said host Phillip Schofield, “Gemma Collins is Marilyn Monroe. Don’t go away.”A big ask. But then so’s stling a fit of the giggles when Richard Blackwood describes himself as “the king of cool”, and trying to look at Ryan Side-bottom’s Beauty and the Beast make-up without thinking of Terry Waite chained to a radiator in the Lebanon.The Gemmasaurus, though, performed at least three television miracles at Sunday’s Musicals-themed night.The first was being hoisted into the DOI rafters, on  board a giant ring, within  seconds, by the same team who got the London Eye upright.The second involved claiming the moral high ground, from Jason Gardiner, during a spectacular toddler tantrum at the end of her Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend routine.And the third, but biggest of all, was somehow getting voted through to next week’s show despite re-writing the entire history of musicals. Gentlemen, it transpires, no longer prefer blondes.They can’t  stand them, in fact.QUIZ show doughballs of the week. The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The Burger And The King is a documentary about which singer’s eating habits ”Gianluca: “Billie Jean King.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “If I meow, what animal am I ”Poppy: “A goat.”Celebrity Mastermind, John Humphrys: “In an  poem, what season of the year does Keats describe as ‘the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness’ ”Monty Panesar: “Oliver Twist.”Joe Lycett: “The fictional Champion the Wonder Horse is actually a what ”Ben: “A zebra.”. THIS Morning handover of the week. Holly Willoughby: “Love against the odds is the subject of the phone-in today. Vanessa Feltz, what kind of calls are you hoping for today ”“We’re looking for calls from people who think their love is against the odds.”And that’s why it’s about to win a National Television Award for the ninth year in a row. ANOTHER week brings another incompatible pair of reality TV gimps, with an E title that also sounds suspiciously like their viewing figures.Spencer, Vogue and Baby Too, a fly-on-the-wall documentary, about Matthews and Williams of that ilk, which is based  on the classic misapprehension of every first-time parent: The world is simply full of people who give the slightest toss about their newborn.It’s not. Nor is anyone listening when they bang on about the “tiredness, sleepless nights and blah blah blah”.The only reason I kept watching this one, in fact, was to try to establish exactly how Spencer and Vogue earn a living, as they’re one of those independently wealthy couples who give very little clue as to why they’re always so “busy, busy, busy”.It took a couple of episodes, but eventually Vogue muttered some- thing about her own fake tan range and Spencer said something even less convincing about cooking, before adding: “We bring dferent things to the table.” The urge Spencer really wants to milk, it turns out though, is a creative one. So, at the climax of episode two he’s striding into London’s Soho Theatre for an audition, with the defiant announcement: “I’m going to open or shut the door on my childhood dream of becoming an actor.”And how’s that going Make sure it bangs your a*** on the way out, Spencer.TV GOLD: The Paras: Men Of War, on ITV. BBC’s Revolution In Ruins: The Hugo Chavez Story detailing exactly how socialism, with Jeremy Corbyn’s connivance, destroyed Venezuela, the most oil-rich country in South America.Sky Atlantic repeating series one of The Sopranos. And Jeremy Kyle’s captions offering us: “My deceased mother told me on the way to Peter Andre that my dad is my step-dad.” A family trauma so painful, it could not cease until he’d closed the set with Mysterious Girl.GREAT Sporting Insights.

Ah, oui, Dominique. Not as British as you might think, Grieve.Which may explain why he  is now doing such terrible damage to our national interest and to the future of our parliamentary system by trying to block Brexit. Over the two decades since he became an MP in , this pukka, posh-suited, punctilious figure has been a pedantic regular in House of Commons debates.He would crook one of his little fingers at an angle, give his neck muscles a creaky tweak and insist, with a shot of the cuffs and a shuffle of minimal notes, that ministers and officials must always comply with statute and precedent and time-honoured procedure.When giving these lectures — they were seldom short — he would touch the rim of his glasses, give a little mallard-style cough and allow a patronising smile to inhabit his broadening bill.He would explain that raw political instinct and passion, of the sort voiced by the Nigel Farages and Jeremy Corbyns of this world,  were not by themselves good enough in politics. He looked down on such things.Politicians whose demagogic brio reflected the public’s molten anger  Puh-lease, how vulgar. They did not accord with Grieve’s gods of logic.“With respect,” he would say — and it is one of the older truths of Westminster that when people say “with respect” they mean the sneery opposite — “with respect, we have to do things according to the rules, for that is the way this Parliament works and those are the sort of people we are.”I paraphrase him but that was very much Grieve’s position. He was a creature of propriety.He could cite legal sub-section and addendum and annex and codicil that proved, we were told, the unarguable merits of his position.With Monsieur half-French Grieve, the ancient principles of English law were our majesty. Our mainstay!Plenty of us clocked that Grieve was a bit of a prune, an oddball, the fogeyish son of privilege. His dad Percy, wouldn’t you know it, had also been a Tory MP of the gusset-and-sock-suspenders old school.Percy once worked as a liaison officer for French wartime hero Charles de Gaulle, who hated the British . It was said that Old Man Grieve agreed with de Gaulle.“The trouble with Percy  is that he likes foreigners  a great deal better than his own people,” concluded an acquaintance.Dominic, in childhood, worshipped his father and once won a school oratory contest by making an admiring speech about de Gaulle.Does “Dominique”, too, like continentals better than his fellow countrymen  It sure looks that way. In June , in one of the greatest thumpings our elite was ever given by the people, we voted to leave the EU. Dominic Grieve, newly decorated with France’s Legion d’honneur for his political work, was horried.Indignant. You could even say he was ag-Grieved. And so he touched the rims of his glasses, did some ducky quacking and set to work to block Brexit.The trouble, as has often been pointed out to him, was that the democratic vote had gone against him.At first he said, through gritted teeth , that he would respect the result of the referendum.In  he was re-elected as MP for prosperous Beaconsfield, Bucks,  on a Tory manesto which said exactly that.Every Tory MP promised to get us out of the customs union and single market.Labour MPs also promised to honour the referendum result. What lying bastards these people are. When the new Government started to get into political dficulties, the once-principled Grieve saw his chance. He stopped saying he would respect the referendum result. He wanted us to stay in the customs union. He wanted a second referendum.Most startling of all, he plotted to bypass all those rules and time-honoured procedures he used to say were so vital for our political safety.After a secret meeting with the appallingly biased John Bercow, Grieve got that anti-Brexit Commons Speaker to chuck out centuries of accepted debating rules.Propriety was smashed like plates at a Greek wedding. Legal advice was ignored.This former Attorney General’s campaign against Brexit, which will next week see him and a minority of MPs attempt to remove law-making from the elected Government, took on a wild, crazed aspect.The possible upshots for our democratic system are terrying. When MPs stop even bothering to pretend they will honour their election promises, why should anyone vote Why not just seize power by force  It’s a recipe for anarchy on the streets.At the moment, Corbyn’s Labour Party is going along with Grieve and Bercow but Corbyn will surely eventually realise that warping parliamentary rules to stop an elected Government from governing will do him no favourshe himself becomes Prime Minister.  It always takes time for the penny to drop with dozy Corbyn.Meanwhile, we are left  with the bizarre spectacle of one-time legal details nerd Dominic Grieve going back  on everything he ever stood for, overturning ancient parliamentary conventions.All along, it seems, his loyalties were not to a rules-based system but to the blue flag of a European Union that is now, increasingly, our rival and our deadly threat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But his successor cannot air a far more likely outcome without Remoaner toys being thrown out of the pram.It is not ENDORSING trouble to point out the risk.  The truth hurts, though, doesn’t it  The  plots to sabotage our biggest ever democratic mandate have already inflamed deep isions.Now Roland Rudd, the mega-rich “people’s vote” leader, phones in from a billionaires’ conference in Switzerland to advertise his plan to cheat .million mainly working-class people of their Brexit ­victory. How do he and his  ­cult-like team think that will go down The other Remainer gang aren’t much better. Yvette Cooper’s plan to delay Article  and “avoid No Deal” would destroy our negotiating leverage. Its true purpose is to buy time to kill Brexit.Mrs May is still set on the one sensible course: to persuade the EU to tweak the deal and try for a Commons majority.If Remainers defeat it we are in  dangerous waters, as the PM has a duty to point out.ALL along, our negotiations have been let down by defeatism and naivety.Theresa May’s Remainer envoy Olly Robbins was outsmarted at every turn.Even now, as the PM suggests ing to Brussels to amend the backstop, Robbins texts another Eeyore — Philip Hammond — to say it isn’t worth it.Which is why replacing him immediately with hard-bitten Kiwi trade negotiator Crawford Falconer makes sense.Put a pro in charge.NOW Brussels admits it WILL build a hard border in Irelandthe deal is defeated.Marvel at their folly, and Irish PM Leo Varadkar’s. Their solution to avoid the border was so  tough on Britain that they could end up with one much faster.The answer is obvious. Time-limit the backstop to win over the Commons.Then focus every effort on technology to solve the problem before that deadline.CHAOS aside, our economy surges ahead.More in work than ever. The lowest unemployment in  years. Pay up . per cent, inflation at just . per cent.It makes mugs of those who forecast  immediate meltdownwe voted Leave. Even the OECD chief once petried of No Deal has U-turned. “The whole world runs by WTO rules these days,” he says.Cracks are also appearing in Brussels’ armour.

A new political party, which represents what a lot of us want.Because you’ve got to say — the parties in Westminster aren’t doing that, are they Whatever happens at the end of this awful Brexit mess, one thing is clear, our politics have to change.The isions between our current parties no longer reflect the isions in the country. If Brexit has told us anything, it’s told us that.And there is a growing anger out there that the views of millions and millions of people are simply not represented in Parliament.That’s obvious from Brexit — more than a third of Labour voters wanted us to leave. Including a majority in some northern constituencies. Almost two thirds of Tory voters wanted us to leave.Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip, has already said he fancies creating a new party. A Brexit Party.Good luck to the man — I might even join it, because I have the horrible feeling our Parliament is going to betray the people, and we’ll end up staying in. That would be a travesty of democracy.The very reasons which convinced more than million of us to vote for Brexit were the same as those which are causing isions across Europe. And as a result we’ve seen the huge rise of populist parties. In Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Greece, France and even Germany. Oh — and, of course — the USA.These parties are sometimes right wing, sometimes left wing. In Italy there is an alliance between the two.What they are all, though, is dferent to the politics we have now. They are parties which listen to the people. Populist is just another way of saying popular, really.Most agree on a whole bunch of issues. We need to control immigration, number one. Especially immigration from Islamic countries.We need a bit more respect for the nation state: People feel proud of the countries in which they live. Yes, even some Belgians.A lot are socially conservative. By which I mean they do not have much time for gender neutral toilets, LGBTQI protests, political correctness and so on.Instead, they have a respect for traditional values. For the family, for the Christian faith, on which our countries were founded. For our histories. And they are sceptical of the European Union.But they also recognise that there are deep economic isions within our countries which need to be addressed. In our own country a terrible chasm between the affluence and influence of London, versus the rest of the country. Between rich and poor.We have no political party right now which covers those bases.But that is where the real ide in society lies. So, as January drags on — how about a party  One that represents US Labour MP Diane Abbott thinks that the BBC Question Time programme discriminated against her because she is:a blackAbbott got a rough ride and the audience spent most of the time laughing at her or booing.Diane, listen. It’s not your skin colour. It’s not your gender.It’s something  altogether.We are used to politicians speaking down to us.And we are used to politicians being thick.But when both occur at the same time, that’s when the rest of us decide we’ve had enough.Stuff the BBC won’t tell you.Number One – The International Monetary Fund has admitted it got its projections wrong.The UK economy is not stagnating. Economic growth for the next year will be every bit as strong as in France and Germany.And meanwhile all the other indicators – investment, employment, growth in wages – are MUCH better than those in the European Union.Someone tell Huw Edwards.Yet again I’ve accepted a Facebook friend request from a woman without checkingshe’s a proper woman, rather than a porno sock-puppet.Sure enough, within the minute, I was invited to view intimate photographs of the lady.And she ended her invitation with the words: “Slap my frog, cowboy!”Why would I want to slap her frog  I hope her frog has a long and happy le. And why am I a cowboyTheres nothing funnier than slebs making idiots of themselves while politically grandstanding.Gary Lineker, for example, does it every week. His intellect is about as radiant as a candle flame in an aircraft hangar. But he still gives it large, ranting about Brexit. And praising Europe’s worst leader, France’s Emmanuel Macron.The latest slebs to fall foul are the Spice Girls. They posed for photos in “edgy”T-shirts reading: Gender Justice. Now it’s been revealed those shirts were made in a workshop by women who are paid p per hour.There’s gender justice for you.The memorial to Bomber Command in London’s Hyde Park has been defaced by scumbags.They threw paint over the sculpture – and also vandalised statues of Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Our pilots in World War Two won a battle against all the odds to protect this country from fascism. More than , of them died doing so.The filth who vandalised the memorial know nothing of that. Nothing of personal sacrice, of hardship, of discipline.And they know nothing of history, full stop.What kind of people are we raising in this country So, huge congratulations to Ant McPartlin.The perpetually smirking Geordie munchkin won “best presenter” at the National Television Awards, despite not having been on television for a year.People have criticised the decision, but I’m all in favour.Andhe promises to stay off the screens for another  months, I’d give him next year’s award, tooDid you see the shots of the babes turning up for the National Television Awards I call them babes because it was minus ten or something out there. And they rolled up to stand on the red carpet outside in flimsy dresses slit from ankle to lady garden. Freezing their cloppers off – like Emily Atack.One woman was dressed in what seemed to be a small bit of string. Talk about chapel hat pegs.I’ll stop calling them babes and start calling them Very Real Women Who Must Be Appreciated For Their Brilliant Talents Not Their Looks when they turn up for these events in a nice warm parka, a woollen muffler and some Ugg boots.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And Ms Truss will claim Labour’s own pollsters are worried that young voters in towns and cities are the “least loyal” to Mr Corbyn.The Cabinet Minister will say: “Young people are going off Jeremy Corbyn even faster than his own MPs are. This is the most self-starting, business minded generation ever, and all Corbyn offers is high taxes and more state control.“Conservatives have cut taxes and made it easier to start a business. It’s Conservatives not Labour that will help young people fulfil their ambition and turbocharge the economy as we leave the EU.”The intervention comes just weeks after the Treasury’s secretary hinted she believed HS should be scrapped so billions could be invested where.She has told allies Britain needs to spend much more on faster web connections across all corners of Britain. So far the Government has only committed to promises million full fibre connections by .And Ms Truss will say the Government has to be far more radical in shaking up planning rules in housing so “young people have the chance to live near the best jobs.The state is not always the answer to modern problems – and it’s precisely the opposite of what the new generation want.”Some  per cent of  to  year-olds voted for Jeremy Corbyn in the  Election. A surge in turnout among the younger generation - the so-called ‘Youthquake’ - was cited as the reason for Labour’s strong showing in last year’s General Election.Labour’s share of the youth vote did increase, but its popularity also went up among all ages except for the over s.I’m in Leeds today to talk to young people about the future of the UK beyond Brexit. Because after March, the people with the most to gain are Britain’s under-s. This is the breakthrough generation – and I want to listen to them, writes Liz Truss.This generation – the first to have grown up on the internet, more connected and more enterprising than any that came before – are best equipped to enjoy the freedom that comes with leaving the EU. As we bring power back from Brussels to the streets of Britain, they are raring to go.There is a lot of latent potential to tap in to: the latest data shows that the UK now has % more - year old entrepreneurs than in . That’s because they have more tools to succeed than ever – like the internet and smartphones. Seeing their heroes on YouTube rack up more viewers than primetime TV, or an app developed by a teenager change an entire industry, has given Gen Z the bug for success – and they’re only just getting started.Recently I met a group of young entrepreneurs under  years old. Their energy was infectious, and they had two tips for us in government: make the rules simpler, and break down barriers for under-s to set up enterprises.We now have an army of high achievers brimming with ambition, and with the drive to shape their own futures. We’re told by Labour that they’re all sandal-wearing Corbynistas, but this couldn’t be further from the truth.Research shows the young are more interested in making money than older generations and are less likely to support higher taxes. And it’s Conservatives, not the red-flag-waving Marxists, that are helping them succeed. Barriers to entry into business have never been lower thanks to our reforms and tax cuts, meaning anyone with a bright idea can start an empire from their bedroom.This is also the first generation benefitting from our school reforms, with tougher exams preparing students for the dynamic modern economy. Like Brampton Manor Academy – the state school in East London that recently had  children accepted to Oxbridge. Far from snowflakes, we’re raising a generation who refuse to be put in their place and who are shaking things up.These young people are the future of Britain, and we have to ensure Brexit works for them. Too often in this country our instinct is to be too defensive, sacricing opportunities to preserve what we have. The danger is that it leads to state subsidies and regulation propping up industries and preventing new, fresh ideas from taking off. We must not fall into that trap.An obvious example is housing, where we have reviewed planning rules and provided additional infrastructure funding so that more young people have the chance to live near the best jobs. And we should turn up the heat of competition, so that new building companies can take on the big corporations who stand in the way of change.We need to keep an eye on regulation. We need to ensure standards, while allowing iniduals and businesses to be independent, embrace risk and reward, and enjoy all the benefits that come with it.And we should solve our modern challenges – like fibre connectivity– with more competition and new firms delivering cheaper, better ways forward, not politicians taking control and leaving no choice when things go wrong.This is exactly the opposite of what Labour are offering. They areanimated by one core belief: that the state knows best and should control more of our lives. If only Jeremy Corbyn were put in charge of trains, water or the internet – goes the argument – we’d all be living in utopia.The state is not always the answer to our modern problems – and it’s precisely the opposite of what the new generation want. They want to be free, not shackled by stling regulation which is good at keeping order, but not so good at delivering a dynamic and exciting economy.So we can appeal by expanding opportunities, taking on vested interests and showing we don’t want to ban any of the good bits of modern le. By doing so, not only will we generate the growth so vital for rising wages and living standards, but also convince a new generation that Conservative values are theirs.With the Prime Minister’s approach to Brexit, this is the path we are on, and I would encourage all my colleagues in parliament to back her in securing a deal so we honour the vote of the British people and leave the EU in a way which benefits every part of our country.We will leave the European Union in March, and step out into a new world with confidence and optimism, and a new generation of entrepreneurs driving Britain to keep defying the predictions. Conservatives should be confident that the future is ours,we choose to embrace it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This research shows for the first time that healthy thin people are generally thin because they have a lower burden of genes that increase a person’s chances of being overweight.“They are not thin because they are morally superior, as some like to suggest.”Her team at Cambridge University analysed the DNA and lestyle of , people who were healthy but underweight,  people of a normal weight and , who were severely obese.The scientists identied around  genetic iations linked to weight. They account for a fth of a person’s bulk.Genes are known to affect a person’s chances of being obese but it is the first time genetic iations have been linked to being slim too.Prof Sadaf Farooqi said: “It’s easy to rush to judgement and criticise people for their weight but the science shows that things are far more complex.”The findings are published in the journal PLOS Genetics.Earlier this month, Health Secretary Matt Hancock insisted overweight people should shoulder the blame for being fat.Unveiling new exercise classes for heavies, he said: “Each of us must take responsibility for our own health.

But this latest initiative – backed by Hugh Fernley Whittingstall – encourages the consumption of any veg from any store.It takes the form of an action movie, with hero kids helping parents save the world from being taken over by angry veg – by eating them. It has the tagline “Eat them to defeat them.”The  supermarkets involved in the production say it aims to “inspire kids to eat more healthily and tackle rising childhood obesity”. The UK ranks  out of  in the EU for fresh vegetable consumption and eight in ten primary school kids do not eat enough.Food writer and broadcaster Hugh said: “This campaign is brave, fun and engaging. It will inspire kids to enjoy the huge range of tastes, textures and colours that the brilliant world of veg has to offer.“A diet that’s big on vegetables will be a massive win for our long term health. I’m hoping to see carrots and broccoli flying off the shelves.”ITV chief executive Carolyn McCall said: “This campaign will reach millions of parents and children through our biggest and most popular shows and it is unlike anything that has gone before. We’re proud to use the power of TV to take a new, bold and brave approach to encouraging kids to eat more vegetables.”Baroness Rosie Boycott, chair of Veg Power, said the advert is designed to engage and entertain kids rather than preach to them. She added: “We can really sht the dial and hope to see long lasting behaviour change.

We have to help her now, so we’ll vote with the Governmentthey agree the right amendment. That’s looking like a short time limit to the backstop at the moment.”The DUP’s public support for Mrs May’s deal is seen as crucial, after dozens of rebel Tory MPs pledged to vote in solidarity with their unionist cause.But a backstop time limit – even of  months - would not win over all Tory hardliners, including European Research Group chair Jacob Rees-Mogg who has demanded its total removal.Sir Graham told The Sun his new plan in a dferent amendment tabled last night was a bid to create Tory unity after months of bitter feuding.The amendment – also backed by No loyalists ex-First Minister Damian Green and Northern Ireland Committee chair Andrew Murrison – asks for the backstop to be replaced with “alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”.Sir Graham told The Sun: “It has been obvious for a long time that the most serious problem arising from the Withdrawal Agreement was a backstop arrangement that could trap Britain in the wrong relationship with the EU in perpetuity.“I’ve tabled this amendment to remove the backstop and replace it with alternative arrangements. I hope that it will bring together the broadest spectrum of Conservative and unionist opinion.”It has also emerged that another senior Brexit hardliner Boris Johnson is close to backing a backstop time limit.

I clearly do not believe making a choice to leave without a deal would be a responsible thing to do, he told BBC Radio s Today programme..   Mr Hammond said leaving without agreement on March  would mean very signicant disruption in the short term and a very signicant hit to our economy in the medium to long term. He added: That is not what people voted for. People did not vote to be worse off, they voted to be better off and they were told that was possible and it is our job to try to deliver on that for them. But he accepted short term disruption in no deal “will settle down” and “we will find ways of managing” the extra time for trucks to get through the border.  Asked repeatedly on Today whether he would remain in the UKs top financial post in that scenario, he said: Im not going to speculate because a lot depends on the circumstances, what happens. The responsibility I have is to manage the economy in what is the best interests of the British people. I clearly do not believe that making a choice to leave without a deal would be a responsible thing to do, but I recognise that that is potentially a default that we could find ourselves in, andwe did find ourselves in that position then the responsible thing to do is to use every possible way of mitigating and minimising the impact. But he also put some distance between himself and Ms Rudd over the importance of Tuesdays Brexit vote, where MPs will consider a string of amendments to Theresa Mays Plan B.  He told Today: What Amber is doing is reflecting a view among some of my colleagues that somehow next Tuesday is high noon, the last chance to make a stand against no-deal. I dont think that is the case, I dont think next Tuesday has to be, or indeed will be the high noon of this debate. Parliament will want to be confident that it will have an opportunity to express its clear view and some of my colleagues, including some who are in Government, will want to be able to express their view. But I dont think next Tuesday is the point when this comes to a head. Support is growing for a bid to delay the date of Brexit by between three and nine months to give more time and block No Deal.Any delay would have to be requested by the Prime Minister - and signed off by all  EU countries. But Tories and the DUP tried to head off the move by hinting they WILL back the Brexit deal -there is a time limit on the Northern Ireland backstop, something the EU has already said it they wont allow. Brexiteers - who fear the backstop will trap the UK under EU customs rules - have flocked to back an amendment this Tuesday that would force the backstop to expire after one year, on  December .If a majority of MPs back the amendment by Tory Andrew Murrison, it could give Theresa May a mandate to try and reopen talks with the EU.Mr Hammond made clear that the backstop wouldnt be removed entirely, but suggested some could take a more nuanced approached. Yet EU chiefs have repeatedly said the backstop is not up for renegotiation - meaning the audacious gambit could just end in more deadlock.

In a direct warning to Mrs May, he said: “Please don’t listen to the Brexiteers’ madness which asserts that, because we have huge plants here, we will not move and we will always be here. They are wrong”.The PM also faced a growing mutiny among her own cabinet ministers after Amber Rudd repeatedly refused to sayshe would resignfaced with a no deal Brexit .Chancellor Philip Hammond told business chiefs at a global summit in Davos that a no-deal Brexit would be “a betrayal” of the promises that were made to voters at the referendum. And Richard Harrington, a business minister, said he was happy to be sacked for saying that he thought a no deal Brexit would be a disaster.   Mrs May was confronted by a series of powerful union chiefs during one-on-one meetings at Downing Street during which they warned her of the devastating impact for workers.Unite chief Len McCluskey, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn , said Brexit Day should be delayedfurther proper negotiations could be held.But he warned: “It’s probably two and a half years too late. I wish we’d been involved in the discussions way back then.” One of the starkest warnings to date came from the Airbus chief who warned the firm will have to make “potentially harmful decisions”faced with no deal. His naked threat was another blow to the Government after arch-Brexiteer James Dyson announced his head office will move to Singapore and PO ferries reflagged its whole fleet to Cyprus. Airbus employs more than , people in the UK with around , more jobs in supply chains. The firm later said the Government had asked it to spell out the potential dangers of no Brexit - a claim No  denied. It came as car giant Jaguar Land Rover, which employs around , workers, announced it is halting production for an additional week due to potential disruption from Brexit.   The PM has repeatedly said she hopes to get a deal but plans to lead the UK out of the EU on March  come what may, despite warnings from business about the damage it would do to the economy.Labour has accused her of trying to run down the clock on Brexit to turn the screws on her Tory backbenchers who helped crush her deal last week.And yesterday her own senior ministers lined up to warn her against crashing out by accident. In an interview with Newsnight, Ms Rudd three times refused to rule out whether she would quit the Cabinet to back a bid by Labour’s Yvette Cooper to delay Brexit unless a deal is struck. Labour is planning to support the move, increasing the likelihood of article  being delayed. The Work and Pensions Secretary said she was going to “wait and see”the PM allowed a free vote on a series of amendments to her Brexit “Plan B” next Tuesday. “At this stage I’m going to stick to trying to persuade the Government to allow it to be a free vote,” she said.   But she told the BBC show that she was “committed to making sure we avoid no-deal”, describing it as “the worst possible outcome”. At a business lunch in the luxury ski resort Davos, Mr Hammond said that crashing out would be a betrayal of the referendum result. “In the  referendum a promise was made to the majority who voted for Brexit - that they were voting for a more prosperous future,” he said. The Chancellor, who like Ms Rudd campaigned for Remain. said he believed the best course of action was a “negotiated settlement”. Business minister Mr Harrington said he was “delighted” to hear the Airbus chief’s comments as he believed no deal would be terrible for business. TUC Frances O’Grady, TUC chief, was first in the door at .am. Before the meeting, she made clear she expected more than just warm words - and wanted no deal taken off the table. “Tweaks aren’t enough - we need substantial change to the whole deal,” she said. In the autumn, the TUC left the door open to a second referendumMrs May’s Brexit deal failed to deliver for workers. Ms O’Grady later concluded it had done just that, saying the PM’s guarantees on workers’ rights in a bid to win over Labour MPs did not go far enough. She called for article  to be delayed and for a fresh vote. After the meeting, Ms O’Grady appealed to the PM to stop appeasing hardline Tory Brexiteers. “She frankly has to stop playing the bad boys at the back of the class and start listening to where Parliament is,” she said. UNISON Dave Prentis, chief of Britain’s biggest union, was next to see the PM at .am. He urged her to avoid a no deal Brexit “at all costs” because of the disastrous impact it would have on his .m public sector members. “The PM needs to rule this out immediately. Crashing out of Europe would be catastrophic for the economy, public services and everyone who works in our schools, hospitals, town halls and police forces,” he said. Unison wants the Government to try build consensus around a customs union - a key Labour demand. Employment rights must also be protected and keep pace with developments in the EU. Mr Prentis has kept a second referendum on the tablethe UK faces crashing out. But after the meeting, he said an extension of article  would be “essential” to avoid the calamity of no deal. UNITE Union boss Len McCluskey, a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn, waved to the cameras as he arrived outside the famous black door at .am. He warned the talks could be a “PR stunt”. Mr McCluskey defended Mr Corbyn for refusing to take part in negotiations himself. Top of Unite’s demands was avoiding a no deal Brexit and the devastating impact it would have on jobs and investment. The Unite chief wants Brexit Day to be delayed for around three monthsfurther proper negotiations can be held. But he again rebuffed calls from cross-party MPs for Labour to swing behind a second EU referendum. Instead he called on MPs to back the party’s own amendment to spell out options for what to do next. “This meeting I’ve had today is two-and-a-half years too late,” he said afterwards. GMB Union chief Tim Roache was last in to see the PM at .pm. The GMB boss pushed Mrs May for legal guarantees to protect workers’ rights from being “ignored or ripped up” once the UK leaves the EU - but revealed after she had failed to go far enough. He also tried to persuade her to back a permanent customs union, which she has so far refused to do. Mr Roache, who has called for a second referendum, also asked the PM to delay the UK’s departure beyond March , but she refused. “We can’t carry on like this. As this crisis worsens, pretending nothing has changed is simply not good enough. The current deal doesn’t cut it. It pleases no one,” he said on his way out. He told German industrialists: “I really don’t believe in this idea. I am very happy to be public about it and very happythe Prime Minister decides I am not the right person to do the business industry job. [A no-deal Brexit] would be a total disaster for the economy.” The union chiefs from the TUC, GMB and Unison, as well as Unite, urged Mrs May to take no-deal off the table or delay Brexit by asking the EU for an extension of article . Mr McCluskey, meeting the PM at No  for the first time, was offered a cup of tea - but no biscuit - as he sat around a large wooden table with the PM, her chief-of-staff and Brexit Secretary. Sources said that Downing Street police and staff addressed the union chief by his first name. He told her that companies were putting investment on hold because of uncertainty over the outcome and urged her to delay Brexit by three months. “I cannot conceive any Prime Minister taking us out of Europe with a no deal. It would be catastrophic,” he said afterwards. Mr Corbyn has refused to attend talks with Mrs May until she rules out a no deal Brexit. The PM’s spokeswoman said she was “absolutely determined” to leave the EU with a deal. “Once we have decided on a way forward,that requires further conversations with the EU then we are prepared to have them,” she added.

Her Majesty insisted her subjects should be never losing sight of the bigger picture, in a speech to mark the centenary of the Sandringham Womens Institute. Echoing the message of her Christmas Day address, the monarch also trumpeted the virtues of respecting other peoples point of view. The Queen , who is president of the Sandringham WI, said: Reflecting on a century of change, it is clear that the qualities of the WI endure. The continued emphasis on patience, friendship, a strong community-focus, and considering the needs of others, are as important today as they were when the group was founded all those years ago.   Of course, every generation faces fresh challenges and opportunities. As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting dferent points of view coming together to seek out the common ground and never losing sight of the bigger picture. To me, these approaches are timeless, and I commend them to everyone. As Head of State, the Queen remains politically neutral and keeps her views on such issues private. But her intervention is likely to be seen as a veiled reference to the febrile, toxic mood of the public debate around Britain leaving the EU. Parliament remains deeply ided over the way forward, with politicians on all sides locked in a bitter civil war as the March  deadline for Britain quitting the EU looms nearer.   In her Christmas Day address to the nation, the Queen touched on the same theme, telling the country: Even with the most deeply held dferences, treating the other person with respect and as a fellow human being is always a good first step towards greater understanding. The Queen attends a meeting of the her local WI once a year at West Newton village hall as part of her winter stay on her Norfolk estate. A Palace source said the monarchs words “speak for themselves”, adding: “The Queens words are consistent with the words of her Christmas broadcast message.” Tory Chancellor Philip Hammond seized on the comments saying: I think there’s huge wisdom in those words. In all things controversial we should seek compromise, we should seek common ground, we should seek a way forward.

Mum Adrian Hoare, , put little Alfie Lamb in the back footwell of an Audi A convertible before her boyfriend Stephen Waterson, , deliberately rammed the seat backwards against him, it was claimed. Alfie died three days after suffering a cardiac arrest outside the home he shared with the couple in Croydon, south London. Waterson and Hoare lied repeatedly after the event and assaulted the two other passengers in an attempt to cover up their crime, the Old Bailey heard. Today Hoares half-sister Ashleigh Jeffrey told jurors her sibling “had an amazing bond” with her toddler son.  The court heard Miss Jeffrey found out about Alfies death four days later, on February  last year and did “everything she could” to support her. Ms Jeffrey went with her to the hospital to see the youngsters body on February . During a conversation back at her flat in Kent she said she could see that Hoare “wanted to say something”. Miss Jefferson added: “She was holding back from whatever it was.” Jurors heard Hoare appeared “scared to say it”. When she later tried to ask her sister, Waterson and another passenger what happened in the car when Alfie was injured he would “jump in and take over the conversation”.  Jurors heard Waterson warned: “I’ll get rid of anyone who gets in my way or causes me trouble.” The court was told he also threatened: “I dont care what anyone in this room says, I know ways to make people disappear.” Ms Jeffrey said she met the following day with one of the police officers dealing with the case to discuss “trying to find out what happened to Alfie”. Ms Jeffrey said Hoare called her a day later, on February , and said she wanted to talk about the incident. Jurors heard Hoare knew Ms Jeffrey was going to record their conversation and an extract of it was played in court.  In it, Hoare can be heard describing how Alfie was behind Stephen in between my legs and the toddler was whingeing. It werent moaning like he was hurting or anything, she said. He had room there. Then Stephen moved his chair back and I was like move. I told him to move his chair forward and then because Alfie was still moaning he shouted at him. He went to move his chair forwards but Emilie was like leave him, hes got room, hes fine, so hes left his chair where it was. Hoare went on to explain how when they went to lt Alfie out of the car he was all floppy. Hes done that before, she added, describing how he would play-act when he didnt want to stand up.  But they quickly realised something was desperately wrong. Ms Jeffrey could be heard asking whether Alfie struggled or anything whilst he was in the car but Hoare confirmed he had not. The mother told her that Stephen started CPR, then couldnt do it and disappeared. When Ms Jeffrey asked her why everything had been kept a big secret, Hoare can be heard telling her: Everyone had to keep their mouth shut because of him [Waterson]. Everyone has to keep their mouths shut about whats happened. The two women went to Sutton Police Station later that day where Ms Jeffrey handed the recording over to the officer. Hoare and Waterson, from Croydon, south London, deny manslaughter. She also denies charges of child cruelty for placing Alfie in the footwell and common assault on Ms Williams on February . But Hoare and Waterson, have admitted perverting the course by submitting  statements to police. The trial continues.

The pairs relationship has been under some strain in recent months following a number of frosty public engagements. Princess Diana biographer Robert Jobson says Prince Charles knocked heads together over Christmas in a bid to halt the disagreements between the Duchesses. He told Sunrise earlier this week: I think there’s no smoke without fire. I do think it has been blown up a little bit but there have obviously been a few problems between the two ladies and even between the two princes. There’s some truth in the rumours. I’m sure at Christmas Prince Charles was knocking heads together and you can see that by those photographs of them all walking together in a line. But they looked like they had been pushed together in a line, to be honest.   Meghan and Harry appeared happy and releaxed alongside Kate, Prince William and the rest of the Royal Family during a Christmas service at St Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham. The couples laughed and joked as they greeted a crowd which had gathered to catch a glimpse of the royals outside the church. Jobson also dismissed suggestions that the Meghan had chosen another hospital to snub the royals. He said: They’re going to be down in Frogmore Cottage , which is near Windsor so they’re going to be out of town anyway.   This is actually whereSophie Wessexhad her babies and I think they’re quite skilled in older mums. Sophie was quite late having her babies –  or  I think – and then you’ve got Meghan who’s going to be .

The private wing of the NHS hospital is also where Princess Diana gave birth to both Princes William and Harry. And the maternity ward is fit for royalty, with art installations, luxury toiletries and chef-made gourmet food - including afternoon tea.

Meghan recently revealed she was six months pregnant on a trip to Merseyside with Prince Harry .She is expected to give birth around April.It is understood that the Duchess has opted to give birth at Frimley Park Hospital in Frimley, Surrey.The hospital is  miles away from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s newly-refurbished Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Windsor Castle.But while it is more conveniently located, the hospital offers no special facilities or personalised treatment.  The NHS-run hospital’s large labour ward doesn’t offer private care for maternity patients, while rooms don’t come with TVs or even en suite bathrooms. Private postnatal rooms are available for pound-a-night, but they don’t offer any luxuries. Meghan could also opt to stay in one of the four birthing rooms in The Mulberry Birth Centre, which focuses on “birth without medical intervention” and offer mood-changing lights and a pool roomshe prefers a water birth.

They told the world via Twitter that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were expecting their first child in the spring of . Many people were thrilled about it and have been congratulating the couple and celebrating the upcoming birth ever since. However it seems there are some, who no matter what they see or hear, just cant accept that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a child anytime soon.   A look on Twitter reveals that some people have become convinced that Meghan, , is faking her pregnancy. The trolls have even started a hashtag for their cruel posts, likening the whole thing to the shambles of Brexit by using #Megxit. Many have posted pictures of the mum-to-bes baby bump and claimed that it isnt real, suggesting it is merely a fake bumpor a cushion. Some also appear to believe that Meghans bump moves position on her body during engagements.   One person wrote: Ive had quite enough of this utter fakery! This is WRONG @RoyalFamily! You CANNOT pretend Meghan Markle is pregnant, when she obviously isnt. How was this allowed to happen  This is treason. #Megxit #moonbump Another said: I have two college degrees and one master degree. I also speak three languages. Im definitely educated and still think everything about Meghan is fake, including her pregnancy. A third wrote: I wonderHarrys in on it with her orshes keeping it from him too that shes faking her pregnancy.   As well as this, those using the hashtag have also taken issue with Meghans ability to bend down and squat during royal engagements - such as during a recent visit to Mayhew Animal Home in London, where the Duchess bent down to cuddle an adorable dog. The trolls dont think it should be possible for her to do this in her condition. Twice she crouched right down, first to pick up a dog. Look how far she leans. The she bends down with her coat open, you can see how squished her tummy is. That would NOT be possible with a baby in there, commented one Twitter user. A second added: Every woman who has been pregnant can give it in writing. WE DONT SQUAT LIKE THAT. IF THERE IS A LIVING BEING IN THERE, WE DONT SQUAT LIKE THAT PERIOD.   The Duchess recently told a royal fan that shes six months pregnant and revealed to another that shes due around the end of April. She also revealed that the couple dont knowtheyre having a boy or girl so are keeping the nursery neutral. Meghan and Harry, who tied the knot in May , are currently renovating the poundmillion Frogmore Cottage on the grounds of Windsor Castle where they plan to raise their little one. Meghan is said to be focused on making sure everything is perfect in their new home and is thought to be using a vegan, toxic-free paint to decorate the babys nursery.

Staffordshire bull terrier Dinky, who was not on his lead, had wandered off as his owner chatted to another walker. Then a splash was heard – and the distraught dog lover was sure his pet had tumbled to his death. But, luckily, the tide was in and an RNLI leboat was able to rescue the plucky canine uninjured. Coastguard Kerry Jury said: “The owner only shyrealised [what had happened] when he heard a splash in the water. “Dinky was in the water for a little while before a leboat, which was nearby on training duty, recovered him. “The owner was very relieved and the dog was freezing, so it was then taken to the vet’s.”   It is believed the surface of the water broke Dinky’s fall, allowing him to paddle to a nearby beach. He was then picked up by leboat crew and wrapped in a blanket before being reunited with his relieved owner. The man in his s, who did not wish to be named, took his pet for a check-up before going home to Yeovil in Somerset. The dramatic rescue happened at chalk clfs at the Old Harry Rocks beauty spot on the Isle of Purbeck, in Dorset, on Wednesday. Becky Mack, of Swanage Leboat Station, said: “He was incredibly lucky to survive the fall in the first place and avoid hitting any rocks on the way down. “But he was then at risk of the advancing tide. “Luckily we got to him in time. By the time we reached him, the dog was out of the water but still very cold.

Mercedes Hoblin was in her third year in the care industry when she decided to make a dramatic career change in October last year. The -year-old mum, from Boreham, Essex, extracts beans - or build-ups of smegma - from the tips of horses penises for pound per animal. Its a dirty job, but someone has to do it - and Mercedes, who has has owned horses for years, told Essex Live she has never really minded cleaning their nether regions to keep them healthy.   Its a task that is often overlooked or not done regularly enough by owners of a gelding, a neutered male horse. Mercedes got her start by extracting beans - hardened masses of dirt and grime - from her own horses and others at her stables between  and . She then made it her business, charging pound per horse or pound per horse for a group of at least four. She said: It was quite a job change, none of my friends and family are horsey but I have owned horses for years and I never really minded cleaning that area of them. She added: My friend said it is a niche in the market and that I should do it full time so I started a Facebook page and now it is my full-time job. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES   I started doing it on my own horses and other horse owners at my yard asked me to do it on theirs and it just stemmed from there really. Now I can just pop them out. I did some research about vets finding these beans but it wasnt until I did it myself that I couldnt believe the size of them. They can be gigantic. She said: Most of my friends thought it was a bit of a joke at first, they are a bit grossed out by it all but they cannot believe how [my business] has taken off. Everyone I have been to say they are shocked at what I can find. I have been to clients that overly clean the area and it causes problems. I want people to be more aware of the problems these beans can cause because it can be dangerous for your horseleft untreated. She said a shop museum called Curiosities from the th Corner, in Battlesbridge, has approached her and expressed an interest in displaying some of the biggest beans she has collected.  The shop doubles as a museum and shows off macabre wonders from around the world. Mercedes said: The museum got in touch with my via my Facebook page and askedI kept my beans. I usually chuck them away but he askedI could keep some so he could put them in a display jar. He is still working out how to preserve them. Mercedes, who owns three horses, wears plastic gloves when she removes beans from the urethral fossa, which is just above the urethra, the tube which urine passes through. If they arent removed, they could block or impede the flow of urine, which could lead to infections and kidney problems. Mercedes travels around Essex and as far away as Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, and Herefordshire She said: People call me for all sorts or reasons. Sometimes it will be because their horse is misbehaving, other times it may be because their horse cannot wee properly. I have even had horse owners come to me because they think their horse might have colic.  Lots of flies around the area in summer can also indicate a problem. People dont want to pay for a vet to come out because they are so expensive so they often call me instead and eight out of ten times the horse will have a bean. When I first started I thoughtI can do about four a week it would be good but now I do around four or five a day. It usually takes about  to  minutes to clean a horses genitals. Mercedes said: First I use a gel and a spray to clean the area. It does depend on what type of dirt it is. Some horses are cleaner than others, it all depends on how the horses are kept, likethey live outside they will be dirtier than those kept in. I always wear gloves when I do it, and I just use a sponge and hot water. The first level is the shaft pocket, I then use my hands to go further up to the horses penis. I just feel around it andthere is a big bean I can feel it straight away. They are like rocks which can cause lots of problems for horses. They can be more than three inches longtheyre that big I have to try and break them down with my hands because it can be quite painful and uncomfortable for the horses.

It says: This period will most likely start changeable and cold, with spells of rain and hill snow, occasional stronger winds, and brighter showery interludes. As we head further through February there is an increased chance of seeing very cold conditions developing with a greater probability of northeasterly or easterly winds.

Prosecutors previously alleged Lewis Bennett intentionally inflicted the damage to sink the vessel in the Bahamas in . The -year-old has already pleaded guilty to killing Isabella Hellman on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He reached a deal last November in which he said his wes death was an accident caused by negligence - and he didnt witness what happened. However, a court in Florida was shown new evidence today by prosecutors seeking a maximum term in a sentencing hearing next week. Kurt Lunkenheimer urged a judge to go above sentencing guidelines, reports CBS .   The court was also shown pictures of the le raft where Bennett was found with his luggage and provisions. In the papers filed to court, Lunkenheimer argued the fact that the defendant would pack all of these items into a le raft, but not actively and diligently look for his we was among reasons requiring an eight-year sentence. As part of his plea, Bennett agreed to ask for no less than seven years in jail.  Until his deal he had long maintained he had no knowledge of how his bride disappeared from their -ft catamaran as they sailed from Cuba to Florida. However, last week week Isabellas family wrote to the judge asking him to reconsider the plea deal and instead class her death as murder. According to the letter, they want Bennett to go through a trial and be acquitted than to allow him to plead involuntary manslaughter.   That Lewis Bennett is being allowed to plead to involuntary manslaughter is outrageous to us, the letter read. While our lawyer has explained to us that these facts are circumstantial and may not result in a conviction of murder, we strongly believe that a plea to involuntary manslaughter is not only insufficient but actually less consistent with the facts than an acquittal or a murder conviction would be. Hellmans family also say they have struggled with being unable to see Emelia, Hellman and Bennetts daughter. She currently lives with Bennetts family in the UK.   According to the criminal affidavit, US prosecutors believed Bennett intentionally sank their boat. He was able to save himself and pound, worth of silver and gold coins. They had come from a vessel he was a crew member of in St Maarten in . Cops later found  more coins at the Florida home he shared with his American we. The US coast guard called off its search for Hellmann after four days of being alerted to her disappearance. Bennett claimed his we was at the helm as he slept, but he was jolted awake to find the boat badly damaged and no sign of her.  Bennett, a Bangor University graduate, told the US Coast Guard that Hellmann was on deck and wearing a le jacket as he went to bed at pm on May , just a few hours after they had left Havana.

I find it inconvenient to have to do regularly. I dont like the way blood tastes.   Logan and Daley always get to know their blood donors and have them tested every six months for bloodborne diseases. The first time Daley ever drank blood was when while she was sat in an English class. It was actually a really intense experience for me, she said, adding she started to feel this intense thirst she had never felt before. I ran to the first water fountain I could find and I started gulping down water.   I didnt feel any less thirsty. At that point, I happened to run into one of my friends in the hallway that had been helping me through my awakening. We found my friend and they pulled out a lancet and I drank from them and it was immediately gone. Meanwhile Logan, who spends just an hour a week in the sun, had his vampiric awakening when he was .   He said: Being a vampire isnt something that you can just choose. It is something you are born with. It is something that is a part of you. The first time I ever consumed blood, it was empowering, heightened all of my senses and sensations — a rush.

Another schoolboy got four years in a juvenile detention centre for also raping the girl twice. Two other migrants were sentenced to two years and  months in a youth prison, while two walked free after receiving suspended sentences. One -year-old boy was sentenced to two years and nine months in a youth prison, while another -year-old only got a -month suspended sentence for aiding the others. This week, the seventh and eighth schoolboys were found guilty by a court in Wuppertal after they fled to Bulgaria to escape punishment but were picked up and extradited back to Germany.

Lara Hall, , met a man called Sajjad online through friends from Lahore, who wooed her by telling her she would live in a Spanish-style villa and that he would “fill in all the blank spaces” in her troubled le. The law graduate, who suffered from OCD and came from a dysal family, said she was “completely vulnerable” to Sajjad’s charms, especially at a time when her le in Sydney was “s***”. However, once she arrived in Pakistan the horrying truth about him began to emerge. Lara flew to Lahore to meet Sajjad for the first time early last year for his brother’s wedding so she could seetheir internet romance could turn into the real thing.  But when she arrived she discovered the house he lived in was filthy with  people living in five rooms. Over the next few weeks Sajjad admitted that he had fabricated the Spanish villa story and that he was not the man he had claimed to be. Then the abuse started, she said, and she couldn’t leave as Sajjad told her that because her visa had expired she would be arrestedshe left the house. She said: “Sajjad raped me and his brother attempted to rape me on multiple occasions. “I was a kept woman, I was denied feminine hygiene products and had to bleed freely, I was starved over long periods of time - on one occasion up to  hours.” Lara also revealed that Sajjad once even tried to rape her while she was vomiting and that he once made her lie on the bed with her legs spread to “air her vagina”. He also tried to get her to convert to Islam and when she refused he “became furious”. Lara managed to contact the Australian consulate but said that their reaction was “lacklustre” and they merely advised her to find a safer place to stay.   She was too afraid to go to the local police also for fear of word getting back. Eventually Lara managed to contact the chief executive of an elite private members club for diplomats and the armed forces via Facebook . Dr Kaiser Rafiq told local police that Lara was being kept against her will and she was rescued. She stayed with him for a few weeks before flying to Islamabad to try to sort out how to get back home. Dr Rafiq told Daily Mail Australia: “I find her extremely genius and positive person but I was disappointed and somewhat angry at her for coming to a totally strange country and strange people whom she met only through internet. “Our youth must learn that the internet is not a safe place and we must not believe fantasies which someone portrays on internet.” Lara then contacted the British Pakistani Christian Association to try and get funds to fly back to Australia - who agreed to help her. Wilson Chowdry, head of the organisation, blasted the Australian government for not taking Lara’s plight seriously. She is now safely back in Australia and is campaigning so that other Australians in dficulty while abroad should not be “left behind”. To sign Ms Halls petition, clickhere.

For him, the bottom line is Dundee should have been better than this.“It was very frustrating on Saturday. I think our performance first half, we should be thankful we are still in the cup really,” he said.“It wasn’t good enough. They’ve got the goal to go ahead and then Jesse has done brilliantly just before half-time to get it back and have us level.“It was a good time for us to score and then we did definitely play better in the second half. On the whole, though, it was not good enough.“I suppose it does happen in the cup, we saw that with some of the other results, and the big thing is we are still in there and have a replay where we can make it into the next round.“So we maybe shouldn’t be too hard on ourselves over it but we’re still not happy with the performance.”Like most players after a bad game, now the -year-old just wants to get out on a pitch again and try to put things right.That’s why he breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday when Hearts’ televised clash with Livingston produced a result.Had the Jambos not edged past the Lions, a replay would have been tonight and Dundee’s Premiership visit to Tynecastle would have been postponed.“We have another game right away and that’s good. The one thing we didn’t want was no game this week because Hearts had drawn their cup-tie.“The thing you want to do after the winter break is get back into playing regularly again right away and you don’t want to be missing games because of things like that. You want to get points on the board as soon as possible.”Turning to the subject of the new arrivals, Ralph believes they will signicantly boost the chances of top-flight survival.So far, he’s been impressed by what he’s seen.He added: “I thought the new lads looked sharp and direct.

That, unfortunately, is something they’ve largely failed to do in three seasons down in the Championship.Past glories, some of them recent, mean United start every campaign as favourites for promotion.And any team walking into Tannadice on a Saturday sees a club geared for football in the Premiership.Too often, however, any edge that’s given United has disappeared because of performances.Even when they’ve lost, in the last two-and-a-half years sides have come out of games against them feeling reputation and expectation have not matched the sum of the parts of the team they’ve faced.Results like two defeats away to Dumbarton the season before last, a - loss at Falkirk last term and two five-goal home losses in this campaign, have led to opposition throughout the ision believing they always have a chance when facing United.In truth, even the draw with Partick Thistle this month and the win over Dunfermline that closed the gap at the top to those three points, were not as convincing as was expected.That’s repeatedly been the case during the two failed attempts to get up. In the big games, too often United have come up short.They did beat Hibs at Tannadice near the end of  but lost heavily to them soon after and quickly dropped off the pace at the top.Andthey won twice at Tannadice against last season’s table toppers St Mirren, the first time came before the Buddies were regarded as their main rivals and the second after Jack Ross’s team were out of sight at the top.This time round, the best so far came up in Dingwall in November when County were beaten -.Without taking anything away from that success, after Paul Watson’s early goal put them ahead, the three points were secured via a gritty rearguard action.Yes, it was the kind of performance that is needed at times in a successful league campaign.So, too, do emphatic victories that tell the rest of the league you are a team to be feared. There would be no better time for such a statement than Friday in Ayrshire."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"gin-bouquets-have-arrived-and-theyre-all-we-want-this-valentines-day","story":"SCOTS distillery Edinburgh Gin is set to launch gin bouquets in time for Valentinersquos Day."},{"url":null,"title":"wild-rose-trailer-released-for-film-about-single-glasgow-mum-with-dreams-of-being-a-country-singer","story":"THE trailer for a new film shot in Glasgow about a troubled single mum who dreams of becoming a Nashville star has been released."},{"url":null,"title":"poor-families-to-be-offered-cash-for-school-costs","story":"FAMILIES on low incomes will be able to apply for financial support to help with the costs of preparing for school from June , the Scottish Government has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"swoty-2018-who-is-your-woman-of-the-year","story":"WHO should be crowned woman of the year "},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-film-festival-2019-sir-michael-palin-and-matt-bomer-to-attend-jam-packed-city-event","story":"SIR Michael Palin is among a host of stars who will be attending Glasgow Film Festival ."},{"url":null,"title":"extra-cash-given-for-food-poverty-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit","story":"AN extra half a million pounds is being spend on emergency charity food supplies to pre-empt an increase in poverty with a no deal Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"oliver-burke-brace-scott-sinclair-pen-and-timo-weah-make-for-a-good-night-at-the-office-for-celtic","story":"If Celticrsquos expensive surface is currently under the weather with a disease, Brendan Rodgersrsquo side remain in robust health.

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

In summary, Mr Anstee explained, not a lot had changed since an earlier report, though a lot of remedial work would be needed.Mr Anstee added that the question is: #What use to people want to make of the hall  Do we need it at all #The next question is whether the hall should be demolished and a new facility built or whether the facade should be retained # for which heritage grant funding may be available. A sense of frustration was evident in the hall as people heard about surveys and consultation # a familiar theme for Inspire Inveraray since its formation three years ago.Hotelier Donald Clark clearly wants to see action and is not keen on retaining the old building. He said: #It#s an eyesore. I think we need to work on the premise of demolition then decide on the use of it.#Next it was on to the vexed question of Inveraray Pier. Numerous attempts to start a dialogue with the owner Archie MacArthur had failed, said Mr Anstee.One approach Inspire Inveraray is looking at is to attempt to purchase the pier using community Right to Buy legislation. There is also the question of whether to bid for the puffer, which Mr MacArthur is trying to sell, as well as the pier itself.To get to the bottom of the community#s views, consultant Charlotte Lee has been employed to pull together opinions and draw up a community action plan.Of only slightly lesser importance is the telephone box in Church Square, in which Inspire Inveraray has expressed an interest. If BT agrees to hand it over, the next question is what to do with it.The many questions highlighted during the evening in connection with the community centre, pier and even the phonebox will be condensed into a straightforward questionnaire to be handed round Inveraray homes with the help of Inveraray Community Council.Anyone wishing to contribute their views or help with the consultation can contact Charlotte Lee on info@cslconsultancy.net or call  ."},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"caravan caught alight sparks major","story":"NewsCaravan which caught alight sparks major fire operationThe derelict property on Kilmarnock Road in Monkton went up in flames last Thursday night as the caravan attached to it caught fire.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  JAN NewsThe fire spread to the adjacent property \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA caravan which caught alight sparked a large scale fire operation as it set ablaze to a neighbouring house.

And Somerset boss McCall reckons the defender could even go on to eclipse goal king Lawrence Shankland - who is wanted by a string of top English clubs. He told the Ayrshire Post: You never want to lose players but Im delighted for the boy on a personal level. Everyone talks about Lawrence but, in my opinion, Michael Rose could go on to achieve just as much -not more -he wants to.  He is that good a player and Ive no doubt he can be a future Scotland international. For my money hes been the best centre half in the Championship this season. Of course wed have loved to keep him, but we have to be realistic. Rose is one of a number of players to reinvent their careers under McCall following his failure to break through as a youth at Aberdeen. And McCall said: It is further proof to boys thatthey come here and develop themselves, they will get their reward. Michael is an outstanding player with a very bright future and we wish him all the best.

And the shining star of the region’s education system confesses she is now “living in a bubble waiting for it to burst”. Gaenor, who joins Heathfield after heading up Dalmilling Primary for five years, said: “I was very happy there and only Heathfield would have pulled me away. “It is always the school I have aspired to. My twins came here and I feel that level of affinity. “All I see is potential. I’ve never been at a school where the surroundings in the community are so rich.” Gaenor cut her teaching teeth in south London before ing north after her sister suffered a severe stroke, aged just . She said: “It made me review my le and decide what was important so we relocated back up to Scotland. “I’ve been back here for  years now and always had one eye on Heathfield as I knew it was such an exciting job. “Part of that excitement is that I live in the catchment and my children went here so it feels like coming home. “But I’m also excited about making this the flagship school. “However, we also need to make this the hub of the local community.” Fitness fanatic Gaenor admits an “open and frank exchange of views” took place during the first meeting with her new parent council last week. It follows concerns over the previous management’s approach to alleged bullying within the school. But she insisted: “I’m all for honest, vibrant and lively dialogue. “None of it was a surprise to me as a parent myself. “I would hate to think I’ll be a comparison to previous management in the school. “What I can bring is my own unique experience to the role. “I want to be open and visible and have parents approach me. “This has to be us together on the journey.” And she added: “I don’t have to grow a passion for the school. It is there within me already. “I feel like I’m in a bubble of looking forward to coming to work and being so motivated – and I’m still waiting for it to be burst.” Now Gaenor, who is often seen walking to school, is planning to get her pupils into shape as part of a new physical and mental drive.

I had a lot of balls left because Georgie loved them and my other dog doesnt so I put them in the box at the Gattonside end of chain bridge.\"Since then someone has attached it to the gate and people have been borrowing the balls and putting them back and even adding new ones.\"I just want the box to remind owners to enjoy every moment with their dog.\"Georgie passed away in May last year after contracting Alabama rot, also known as Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy .Only appearing to affect dogs, the disease damages the lining of blood vessels in the skin and kidney, resulting in ulceration of the skin and kidney damage.The condition can affect any breed or age of dog and a proportion can go on to develop severe, acute kidney failure, which is often fatal.Lynsay and her dogs Georgie and Taffy used to walk along the river most days and it was after one of these walks that she noticed Georgie had lesions on her legs.\"It was after a walk in Gattonside one Saturday that I saw that she had sores on her legs so I took her to the vet on Monday and she was given some cream.\"But she went downhill fast and by Wednesday her poo was black, which I later learnt was a sign that her kidneys were failing.\"I took her to the vets again where she was given a cone to stop her licking the sores but by Friday the vets suspected it was Alabama rot and put her on a drip and kept her in overnight hoping that she would improve.\"But on Saturday we were told that her kidneys had stopped working and she wasnt going to get better.\"I took Taffy with me to spend some time with her and then she got put to sleep.\"Alabama rot was first recorded in the UK in  and the number of cases has risen each year. Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside.

The ingredient was not listed on the label.In the wake of her death her parents have been calling for a new so-called ldquoNatasharsquos Law to make all pre-packaged food clearly display allergen information.Nadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse met Environment Secretary Michael Gove to call for a change in the law to require all foods to be labelled clearly with any allergens A Government consultation has since been launched into food labelling laws focusing on overhauling the labelling of pre-prepared foods which are made, packaged and sold in-store.Speaking on ITVrsquos Good Morning Britain, Natasharsquos father, Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, said the family are asking for labels to list the  well-known allergens as well as the full ingredients.ldquoBecause, particularly people today more than ever, have allergies, severe allergies to many things, not just those  particular things, he told the programme.ldquoSo it allows people who may have an allergy to something  to see the ingredients and not buy that product therefore save their le.ldquoThis is le-saving issues, it is not just a convenience or a fashion, or a trend or a fad, it is about lives, and lives really, really matter.Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, from Fulham, west London, died after she fell ill on a flight from London to Nice after eating a sandwich at Heathrow Airport Under current rules, food prepared on the premises in which it is sold is not required to display allergen information on the package.But under the proposed reforms, published on Friday by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, outlets selling pre-packaged food could be required to follow new labelling rules, including a full list of ingredients required by law.The department said the consultation was designed to give the UKrsquos two million food allergy sufferers greater confidence in the safety of what they are eating.Appearing alongside her husband, Natasharsquos mother, Tanya, said what happened was the ldquobiggest fear a parent ever has for their child when they have allergies.She said that, as parents, they understand how those who have children with allergies live their lives every day, how they feel and how frightening it is.ldquoWe couldnrsquot not do this, she said of the drive to push for food labelling reform.ldquoThis is in Natasharsquos name and it is what she would want because she

food labels were clearer and rules for businesses more consistent.He added: ldquoNatasharsquos parents have suffered a terrible loss, and I want to pay tribute to Nadim and Tanya for their inspirational work to deliver Natasharsquos law.ldquoWe want to ensure that labels are clearer and that the rules for businesses are more consistent ndash so that allergy sufferers in this country can have confidence in the safety of their food.ldquoMany businesses are already bringing changes on board independently, and in the meantime they should continue doing all they can to give consumers the information they need.The proposed reforms cover labelling requirements for foods that are packed on the same premises from which they are sold ndash such as a packaged sandwich or salad made by staff earlier in the day and placed on a shelf for purchase.Currently, these foods are not required to carry labels, and information on allergens can be given in person by the food businessasked by the customer.The department is urging businesses and allergy sufferers to have their say on four options being put forward to change the way allergy advice is provided on these foods.Proposals include mandating full ingredient listing, allergen-only labelling, ldquoask the staff labels on all products, or promoting ldquobest practice around communicating allergen information to consumers.The

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

of what they put in.Mrs Bell was keen for social housing and bungalows to be included within the development.She noted concerns had also been expressed about how the townrsquos infrastructure, such as medical centre and primary school, would cope with further expansion, as well as fears it would lead to wildle, such as deer, being displaced and even killed on neighbouring roads.More detailed plans for the site are expected to be revealed at the consultation event.Ward councillor Norman Hampshire said ldquoone or two issues still needed to be dealt with, including the potential road layout, as

My own wish would be for MPs to seize the moment and vote to revoke Article  altogether. MPs have the power to stop the clock for good, thanks to the good works of legally-minded MPs like the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry.Staying in the EU is the only sure way to stop the endless arguments about Canada plus, Norway plus, customs union, Irish backstop, regulatory alignment, maximum facilitation and all the rest of the gubbins thatrsquos been occupying our addled brains for the last two-and-a-half years. However, this isnrsquot going to happen.And Irsquod have to agree that it would be undemocratic for MPs to simply reverse the result of the  referendum by revoking A. It may be that Parliament has the power and the constitutional right to do so: referendums are only advisory. But it would leave so much unpleasantness that British politics would be soured for decades. There would have to be a referendum.This is where my unease turns to genuine anxiety. I have a horrible feeling that Labourrsquos Diane Abbott was right on Question Time this week when she said: ldquoBe careful what you wish for. She agrees with Nigel Farage that a repeat referendum is likely to endorse no-deal Brexit, perhaps by an even greater margin than in .Evenit left us with a mirror-image result, with say % Remain against % Leave, that would itself be a disaster because it would have no legitimacy. Yes, some opinion polls say Remain would win a comfortable majority, but they said that last time.The Brexiteers are already field-testing their slogans on social media. The frontrunner is ldquoTell Them Again, which may not be as resonant as ldquoTake Back Control but is still pretty hot. It surfs on the very widespread disgust and alienation that many ordinary people feel about the political elite. It appeals to democratic injustice: how dare the globalists ignore the result of , which David Cameron promised would be for keeps What would Remainrsquos slogan be  Itrsquos likely to be a repeat of the Project Fear line which failed dismally in . ldquoDonrsquot put your childrenrsquos prosperity at risk, perhaps, or ldquoThink Twice Think Jobs. But what many pro-Europeans fail to grasp ndash and this applied to the Unionists in the Scottish independence referendum ndash is that it ISNrsquoT the economy, stupid. Brexit voters donrsquot just make their decisions on the basis of economic rationality, as seen from the CBI and corporate Britain.People are always motivated more by emotion than numbers ndash on what they believe to be morally right. The sense that working-class people have lost control is a very potent mobiliser.As in war ndash and it is remarkable how much Brexit mythology harks back to World War Two ndash people are quite willing to sacrice some comfort for what they believe in.I may think they are mistaken. As with the people who supported Donald Trump because he promised to Make America Great Again, and bring back the jobs, I think Brexit voters have been sold a  prospectus by politicians who do not have the best interests of working people at their hearts.But that isnrsquot really the point. I can well understand the sense of injustice felt by people who have been left behind by global capitalism. They want to kick the system, and the referendum gave them a chance to do it. They need a very strong reason not to kick the metropolitans again. Only Labour can provide that reason, and Jeremy Corbyn has been singularly reluctant to do so.His refusal even to meet Theresa May was irresponsible in this climate. It may have allowed him to avoid coming off the fence, but it looked petty and weak. Corbyn should have gone in guns blazing, demanded that she drop the red lines, and then mobilised Labour for either rejoining the single market or for a referendum.Single market membership has always been the logic of Labourrsquos position, even though Corbyn usually refers to a ldquopermanent customs union. Only by joining the European Economic Area could Labour deliver friction-free trade, and protect environmental standards and workers rights. People say that Norway has blocked the UKrsquos entry to the European Economic Area, but this is not true. The Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, has repeatedly made clear that Norway would have severe reservations ndashwho wouldnrsquot  ndash but would not block UK membership.This is because the EEA is essentially a Brussels creation. It was set up as a halfway house to membership of the EU back in  when a number of countries were uneasy about joining the political institutions of Europe. The EEA is just the European Single Market under another name.Brussels endorses British membership of the EEA, and this economic arrangement has a number of advantages over Mayrsquos deal. Therersquos no need for an Irish backstop no membership of the CAP and the Common Fisheries Policy no direct jurisdiction of the European Court and it costs less than EU membership. Of course, it does not bring the full benefits of EU membership. Britain would become a ldquorule taker on trade. But the EEA does not preclude future membership of the European Union.

Were it left to me, I would revoke Article  tomorrow. I just want this madness to stop. But given the metrics in Parliament, we have to look at the least worst options, as the Labour-supporting commentator Owen Jones put it last week. Mayrsquos deal is dead. MPs owe it to the country, and to themselves, to find some compromise that works. Perhaps that can only be achieved with a referendum.

Which is nonsense. The wonderful existentialist crises that increases with age are all the more heightened when you have to factor in an ever-increasing awareness of mortality and moles, of strange lumps arriving in places they shouldnrsquot, of the breakdown of both meniscus and relationships. How can this not make good television To suggest older characters on TV donrsquot work is like saying a classic car is valueless because it doesnrsquot have a satnav. Age implies a better defined character, which suggests heightened comedic possibility. Look at how Still Game has mined this seam of opportunity so wondrously over nine series.Two Doors Down, the second major TV comedy success story to come out of Scotland in recent years, also tunes in brilliantly to middle-aged induced fragility. And BBC rsquos Mum, starring Lesley Manville and Peter Mullan was right on the money. .: Irsquod be lyingI said older generation are naturally more truthful than youngstersOne of the best comedies around right now is The Kominsky Method, the Netflix series which this year won a Golden Globe, starring -year-old Michael Douglas and -year-old Alan Arkin.The age of the actors is important.

In politics age should almost be a prerequisite. Tony Blair and David Cameron were both  years old when they became PM. And it showed. There is the occasional emergence of bright young genius this side of Pitt The Younger but for the most part politics screams out for the statesperson, the wide thinker, and generally those characteristics come with experience. Itrsquos easy to make the argument that the likes of Kenneth Clarke, Vince Cable and Barbara Castle became better politicians with age.Sport has now recognised the value of advancing years.

If a driver, for example, reaches  with a teenage-like sneering disdain for the motoring laws of the land then such a personrsquos rights should be forfeited.

The aim is to prevent a no-deal Brexit.:Theresa May - The last thing we need is a second Scottish independence referendumWhitehall appears to be particularly concerned about this one as it will involve a new bill and so,passed, would be legally binding, which is not the case with the other amendments. The Yorkshire MP has used this route because the end of the Article  process, Brexit Day on March , is enshrined in law, so to change it another law has to be passed.It is thought Ms Cooper and her allies,the amendment is passed in next Tuesdayrsquos Commons vote, are seeking to rush the new bill through the Commons in one day.

One argument will be that her measure sets a dangerous precedent whereby Government is no longer in control of parliamentary business, which could hobble this administration and future ones.Mr Murrisonrsquos amendment to time-limit the Irish backstop is expected to be backed by the Government. If passed, it would enable the Prime Minister to go back to Brussels to demand changes as the only way of getting a deal through Parliament, thus avoiding a no-deal outcome.Of course, it is up to John Bercow, the Speaker, to decide which amendments he will allow to be debated and voted on.

It is designed to give Mrs May additional negotiating clout by indicating to Brussels that this step might be enough to win parliamentary support for the Withdrawal Agreement reached last November.*No backstop.An amendment proposed by Conservative backbencher John Baron states that Parliament will not approve a Withdrawal Agreement which includes a backstop. Two further separate amendments tabled by the Basildon MP offer alternatives of a six-month time limit on the backstop or a requirement for the UK to have unilateral power to end it.*Business Committee.An amendment tabled by Mr Brake would establish a Business of the House Committee to govern the provision of parliamentary time for Brexit debates and legislation, including on a second referendum with Remain on the ballot paper.

Yetthey truly want to put Scotlandrsquos interests first, both will need to consider just what another isive referendum will do for us.Optimistic separatists might conclude that just a few percentage points stands between them and getting their way. But would that be an end to it  After all the discord and uncertainty suffered so far in trying to undo our relatively recent membership of the EU, what complications and obstacles would stand in the way of a smooth exit from our much closer union with the UK that has lasted hundreds of years Equally,the consistent results of opinion polls are any guide, the likelier outcome would in any case be a repeat of the  result. What then  Surely the SNP, like its counterparts in Quebec back in the mid-s, would suffer the electoral consequences of being viewed as the party which will never take No for an answer.Is it too much to think that one day we could have a Scottish government that seeks a unity of purpose across the political ide in pursuit of Scotlandrsquos positive development, rather than simply finding the most effective grievance upon which to try to get their way Keith Howell,White Moss, West Linton, Peeblesshire.THE First Minister, having legal training and lacking scientic background, may well be unfamiliar with Newtonrsquos Third Law: ldquoTo every action there is an equal but opposite reaction. Dr Gerald Edwardsmakes an oblique reference to Isaac Newton: ldquoitsactions promote equal and opposite reactions.Newtonrsquos work is useful, or potentially so, to physicists and politicians.William Durward, South Erskine Park, Bearsden.DR Gerald Edwardsclaims that the  per cent of voters who voted No at the last independence referendum wont be swayed into voting Yes at the next one. However, Scotland and the UK are in a very dferent place than they were in , and many voters voted to stay in the UK because they were told that was the only way Scotlands place in Europe could be assured. Now that we are being dangled over the edge of the hard Brexit clf, there is no reason why Scotland should be thrown into the abyss and suffer cataclysmic consequences for this and future generations, when we voted overwhelmingly to remain within the EU.Dr Edwards complains about the SNPs record in government, but while there are certainly challenges to be met, Scotland continues to compare well with the rest of the UK for instance,we didnt have the Scottish Parliament and SNP Government, we would be paying pound. per item for our medical prescriptions, and spending thousands of pounds on our childrens university tuition fees, as is the case in England. However,Scottish voters want to put the SNP out of government, they have the power to do so, which is not the case with UK governments where at Westminster, Northern Ireland has  seats, Wales has , Scotland has  and England has , meaning Scotland must always get the governments England elects. With independence, Scotland would always get the governments we voted for, not ones we consistently and comprehensively reject.Ruth Marr, Grampian Road, Stirling.WITH all the brouhaha over Brexit, we in Kilmacolm have decided to set up our own autonomous, independent republic of Kilmacolm, with a hard border in the middle of the Clyde.

Surely it is now time to consider legislation compelling  per cent of the electorate to either visit the polling station or submit a postal vote.

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards. And the endless saga of RET must come to an end, otherwise how can bidding companies submit a proposed fare policy ”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

OIC Leader James Stockan has notied Ministers that the council will hand over responsibility for running the service to Transport Scotland, unless sufficient funding is provided.A year ago, a similar level of support was secured, after a y campaign by OIC for fair funding. Of this, £. million was allocated to fully fund Orkney’s internal ferry service during the current financial year, with £ million awarded to Shetland Islands Council for its ferry operations.“But this time there is no specic amount allocated to Orkney or Shetland. The government recognises that it will cost £. million to operate our ageing fleet of ferries during - — and that is what we are asking the government to provide.”OIC is also looking to the government to fund the replacement of the current inter-island fleet. The council has been working with the government on this for a number of years and is currently developing a business case setting out the service levels local communities require, and the engineering options needed to achieve these.Councillor Stockan added: “We would object in the strongest possible termswe end up with a reduction in our ferries funding. This would place a wholly disproportionate and unfair burden on the smallest council in Scotland and would mean us having to make cuts to other vital services.“The ferries are a leline for remote and fragile communities across our islands. Orkney has the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — an inequality we cannot address without proper financial support from the Scottish Government.We are calling on the government to take an honourable approach to fulfilling the will of the Scottish Parliament that we should receive fair and equitable funding for our inter-island ferry service. The principle of transferring Orkney’s internal ferry service to the Scottish Government, at no net detriment to OIC, has already been approved by the council. That is a route we will have to take unless we are provided with the funds to run the service over the year ahead.”For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Tourists visiting Scotland may also have some fun by using the haggis emoji as part of their messages to friends and family at home. If haggis is given the distinction of being granted its own emoji then the wider message is strong that the product is moving with the times, appealing to the masses and continuing to make our nation proud of its food heritage all year round as well as on Burn’s Night.\"Graeme Sharp, spokesman for Quality Meat Scotland, said: “Scotland is internationally renowned for its iconic national dish so what better way to spread the word and inspire people to buy haggis this Burn’s Night than a haggis emoji \"Originally developed in Japan, emojis have been in international use since , hitting the mainstream in  when the Oxford English Dictionary named an emoji one of its ‘words’ of the year.Haggis-lovers can support the campaign by using the hashtag #haggisemoji or by signing the petition.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4862191.1548358491!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit the people must have final say leader comment","story":"The UK is heading towards the economic disaster of a no-deal Brexit # unless MPs back either Theresa May#s deal or a second referendum. If they won#t support May, they must give the final say to #the people#.It is indeed a “disgrace”, as Airbus chief executive Tom Enders lamented, that more than two-and-a-half years after the Brexit referendum, we still do not know what is going to happen on  March.But everyone should be very clear that, at the moment, the UK is heading for a no-deal Brexit unless our MPs take action to prevent it.Just last week, one of two courses of action that would prevent a no-deal – Theresa May’s Brexit plan – suffered the biggest government defeat in the Commons for more than a century. And yesterday, MPs who support the other option – a second EU referendum – admitted the idea did not have enough support and withdrew an amendment to next week’s vote on May’s deal.: Mike Russell: Scots ‘have right’ to consider independence as Brexit alternativeConservative MP Sarah Wollaston said they had done so with “great regret” but that, without the support of Jeremy Corbyn, the amendment would have failed. Labour MP Luciana Berger called on her party leader to “do the right thing”, adding that Labour should not be “facilitating a job-destroying Brexit”. Corbyn’s inability to get off the fence, coupled with May’s stubborn determination to stick with her deal, is pushing Britain ever closer to the now infamous “clf-edge” of a no-deal, as hardline Brexiteers celebrate. In their latest dubious pronouncement, Lord Tebbit claimed that this outcome would result in cheaper alcohol.As The Scotsman has repeatedly said,MPs want Brexit to happen on  March, they should vote for May’s plan. It will damage our economy – as will all forms of Brexit – but it will be as nothing compared to the impact of a chaotic plunge into World Trade Organisation rules. Our economy is far too closely intertwined with the EU’s for such a sudden wrench and we are woefully unprepared.: Lord Tebbit: No-deal Brexit will mean cheaper booze for UKAs Enders warned,the UK does not alter course, Airbus could move its operations out of the country. Many more firms may do the same. Sony has announced its European base is to move to the Netherlands and that country’s government is in talks with more than  British companies about relocating.MPs have an over-riding duty to act in the national interest – evenit may be unpopular. Right now, it is clearly in the national interest to delay Brexit to allow the will of the people to be expressed once more. We the people now know what we are getting intothe UK leaves the EU.

David Mundell has written to the Prime Minister saying as much, and on Wednesday, both sides tested their new lines. Senior UK Government sources say they are ready. “Bring it on,” one told me – the fight about the referendum, not vote itself. Expect the Downing Street line against indyref to harden further.The path to a second independence referendum is at least as long and winding as the one the UK has followed towards Brexit day.

Shouts of “freedom” rang out from supporters, along with more unsavoury barbs from those less well disposed to the former SNP leader.The hearing front of Sherf Frank Crowe in Court  of the Chambers Street building was held in private in line with the usual first appearance scenarios in “solemn” cases which cover more serious crimes in Scotland.It lasted just five minutes and hardly seemed worth the journey for the dozens of journalists who ventured into the court lobby.They were left trying to catch a glimpse through the doors of the action inside the courtroom while police officers stood guard to keep them out.And then Mr Salmond emerged to face the media. It must have felt like a letime – in fact just over a fortnight – for Mr Salmond since he stood just round the block outside the Court of Session to hail a dramatic victory against the government he once led over procedures it used toinvestigate complaints against him.Shouts of “Captain, My Captain” rang out from supporters as Salmond delivered a steadfast rejection of the charges and pledged to fight them. There were even flashes of thistrademark bullishness as he told reporters he would love to take their questions and talk some more, but court rules prevented him from doing so.It may be that the next chance he gets to speak publicly will be from the dock.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4862285.1548404780!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond unique case is not unprecedented says advocate","story":"Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.If challenged, the court’s answer will be considered in the context of the publicity around the allegations. To date no case in Scotland has been stopped because of prejudicial publicity and that’s despite there having been some high-profile cases that attracted considerable, sometimes extremely prejudicial, media attention.These cases were dferent in that the accused were not well-known public figures, but it was argued that publicity about the allegations could prejudice any trial.I wouldn’t call this case unprecedented, but it has its own unique aspects. However, the challenges for the court have been considered before. Two examples are the trial of William Beggs for what became known as the “Limbs in the Loch” murder, and that of Nat Fraser, who was accused of killing his we, Arlene. There had been a great deal of reporting about the cases and the courts had to decide whether fair trials could be achieved. In both situations, the courts decided the cases could proceed fairly, referring to the safeguards of the passage of time between any publicity and a trial the focusing effect for a jury of listening to the evidence and the strong directions given to a jury in such cases to decide only based on evidence they hear in court.Those representing Salmond may argue that he is uniquely well-known and that some allegations against him have, to an extent, been canvassed in the media. They may say that it will be almost impossible to find jurors who have never heard of him. But that doesn’t matter – more to the point is whether it will be possible to find jurors that are untainted by prejudicial knowledge about the allegations.The Crown will say Contempt of Court rules apply and no-one can now publish anything that might prejudice the trial. There is now signicant protection in place and the media can only really report on procedural aspects such as the fact he has been charged.Very senior people at the Crown Office will be involved in decisions about possible proceedings once they have seen all statements and reports.

A police investigation is taking place into the allegations made by two women and dating back to when he was first minister. But Mr Salmond won a legal challenge against the Scottish Government over its handling of the claims.The Scottish Government is carrying out a review of what happened and Ms Sturgeon has referred herself to independent advisers to consider whether she breached the ministerial code during meetings and phone calls with her predecessor. Mr Salmond said Ms Sturgeon’s focus should be on the drive to bring about independence. He said: “Nicola should be concentrating all her energies on the independence agenda where we will never have better circumstances. As far as I am concerned Westminster’s Brexit dficulty should be Scotland’s opportunity.” Ms Sturgeon is to give an update to the Scottish Parliament on her plans in the coming weeks. A formal request for a Section  order which would give Holyrood the authority to stage a referendum was rejected by the UK government last year, with Prime Minister Theresa may insisting “now is not the time” to revisit the Scottish constitutional issue amid the Brexit uncertainty. It is understood that a further request by the Scottish Government would also be rejected by Westminster.Writing in the Sunday National newspaper yesterday, Mr Salmond said: “One of our features in the national movement has been our inability to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of our political opponents. We have tended to concentrate on the shape we’re in.“However, right now the Westminster political establishment is at its weakest point in my letime while the national movement is in good heart. There is not likely to be a better time to force the issue.”However former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars warned there is “no appetite” for a second independence referendum. He said: “There is no national Yes organisation in place – a prerequisite to success as many Yes activists and voters are not SNP.“No policy work has been done on the post-Brexit situation and thus we are not in a position to deploy then new policies in that post-Brexit new paradigm that will be needed to convince No voters to vote Yes next time.”Polls indicate there has been no rise in support for independence among Scots since the last vote in  and Perth and North Perthshire MP Pete Wishart said a vote should be held when it can be won.He said: “We are already making progress towards that with Brexit as the catalyst. But it will be dficult to secure the conditions to make a referendum happen before the next Holyrood election.”Alex Bell, a former SNP government adviser also called for a more considered approach.He said: “The SNP and Yes have to stop seeing independence as a sneaky prize to be won when everyone  is messing up and instead base their campaign on the reality of what Scotland can achieve through an honest understanding of the world.”Ms Sturgeon had pledged to hold a second referendum in the immediate aftermath of Brexit but “reset” her plans after the SNP suffered heavy losses in the  UK election.At First Minister’s Questions last week, she said: “Given the catastrophe that Scotland faces in our economy, our society, our living standards, the prospects for the next generation and our reputation in the world, it is essential that the option of independence is open to people in Scotland.“When people in Scotland have the ability to choose independence, I believe that the country will opt to be an independent one.”The Scottish Parliament has already voted in favour of a second referendum following the Brexit vote as the SNP combined with the pro-independence Greens.\u2028Scottish Secretary David Mundell has written to Mrs May to urge her to maintain her refusal to grant Holyrood powers for a second independence referendum.If the authority to hold a second referendum through a Section  is rejected, as expected, by the UK government, it has been suggested that the Scottish Government could make this the central issue of the next Holyrood election in , as it seeks to build the case for a independence in the years ahead.\u2028Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins suggested Ms Sturgeon will seek a Section  order in the knowledge it will be rejected by in order to “stir up as much grievance and bad feeling as possible”.Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie urged the SNP to abandon plans for another referendum. A Scottish Labour source added: “The last thing Scotland needs is more instability and chaos of yet another independence referendum, what our communities need are Labour governments here and in Westminster to end austerity.”An SNP spokesman said: “With the clock ticking down to Brexit date - and with the Tory government incapable of governing and Labour incapable of effectively opposing - the SNP will continue to focus on standing up for Scotland’s interests in the face of a disastrous Tory-driven Brexit and further austerity.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4848739.1547813565!/image/image.jpg","title":"these are the 6 most wanted people in scotland in 2019","story":"Can you help police track down these  men on their most wanted list Police Scotland would like to speak to the people below and are asking anyone with information to call .©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"airport staff defended after criticism over parking system ","story":"A Bressay resident has praised staff at Sumburgh Airport after criticism over the newly introduced parking charges and the situation for disabled drivers.Last week Joyce Davies, from Skeld, bemoaned the new set-up.

We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"closure of tarbert ferry service to vehicles unavoidable say","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCalMac’s director of service has  described a planned temporary closure of the linkspan at Tarbert ferry terminal as “unavoidable disruption”.The operator has announced the vehicle service will be out of action for five days across February and March.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players from throughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams from Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1380213.jpg--.jpg?1547207055000\n","title":"57 job losses confirmed by administrator jbe not feasible","story":"The Administrator for JBE Mechanical.Electrical Ltd, the Ballymena based electrical and mechanical firm, has announced that following a review of all options in respect of the business, that it is not feasible for the business to continue to trade.Speaking following a meeting with all staff at the firm’s headquarters at Braid River Business Park in Ballymena, the Administrator Gerard Gildernew said: “Unfortunately, following our review of live contracts and the company order book, I have concluded that it is not feasible to continue trading the business in administration.

In response NIEA has been working with the operator in recent months resulting in the operator taking numerous steps attempting to mitigate and resolve the problems. “NIEA staff have visited a number of the residents during this time and we have also worked in close co-operation with the local council Environmental Health officer to obtain information on the odour impact from local residents.“As a result of investigations NIEA issued an Enforcement Notice on  October  requiring the operator to provide detailed proposals to fully resolve the odour problem. The operator has now provided their proposals for additional odour treatment and it is expected this work should be completed by end of January .“NIEA will continue to inspect the site on a regular basis, maintain pressure on the operator to take all necessary actions to minimise odour nuisance and liaise with local residents to keep them updated on progress.”In a statement Stream BioEnergy Ltd said: “We acknowledge and respect the concerns raised and we are continuing to work hard to resolve these as quickly as possible.”  "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8765042.1547127501!/image/image.jpg","title":"business  ","story":"Banbridge company Ferguson#s Irish Linen recently took part in an Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council led trade mission to Western India with other companies seeking new business opportunities.

This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  . The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.Vintage car show celebrates th birthdayIN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8779110.1548153767!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"Students from local schools were thanked by Action MS recently for their fundriaising efforts over the last year.

We regard this as the most important constitutional gathering in a generation,” he said.The conference comes as uncertainty continues to remain over the issue of the Irish border backstop along with the need to ensure EU rights are protected after Brexit.Last November one thousand prominent nationalistsportspeople, artists, actors and leading business heads put their signatories to an open letter to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar outlining their concerns. At the time the Taoiseach responded by insisting the interests of Irish citizens north of the border are a “priority” in the Brexit negotiations."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-24-at-16.30.08.png","title":"eye on the past january","story":"Twinbrook anger at RUCTHERE has been angry reaction from Twinbrook residents to a raid by RUC men on a house in the area which led to the arrest of a father of seven for the non payment of a £ fine.During the raid three RUC men – two of them carrying sub-machince guns – burst into the home of Mr Gerard Duffy at Glasvey Gardens and he was punched and kicked before being taken to the RUC barracks at Dunmurry.Mr Duffy was lted for non-payment of a fine imposed because his car had not been taxed. But, after representations from his solicitor, it was agreed that the fine would be waived when it was learned that no tax book had been available for the vehicle.He was held for an hour and a half in Dunmurry and was released when a relative arrived and paid the fine.The RUC men – one of whom was in plain clothes – had arrived in the area in a red Vauxhall car without markings.One Twinbrook resident said later: “So much for the RUC’s concern about the peace talks. They wouldn’t have done that sort of thing before the ceasefire.”Order is expected soon for new IRA ceasefireA NEW ceasefire order is expected to be issued to all IRA units within the next  hours. But a formal announcement by the Republican Army Council is not expected until early next week.The decision to order a ceasefire came after a second round of talks between senior Stormont and republican officials at a secret venue about five miles from Belfast on Wednesday night.In a statement issued late on Wednesday Britain’s supremo here, Merlyn Rees, said: “I am sure that the people of Northern Ireland would wish to see effective arrangements made to ensure that the ceasefire did not break down. I attach very great importance to this, and practical arrangements would be necessary.”Republican leaders are now believed to regard this as a sufficient gesture to allow them to order another ceasefire.But it is believed that they will want meaningful talks on a number of issues shortly after their ceasefire is publicly announced. Another reason why a new ceasefire is possible has been the low profile approach adopted by the British Army since the shock announcement last week that the truce was off.A key factor in the decision to call off the Christmas ceasefire was the behaviour of British units in Belfast and several rural areas where they stepped up their activity to take advantage of the ceasefire.British leaders in London are known to have been surprised at the IRA decision and there has been speculation that advice from their military leaders – who had claimed that the IRA ceasefire was certain to continue because the IRA was beaten – is now being ignored by Westminster leaders.British Premier Wilson is said to have been furious that the much-vaunted military intelligence network in Ireland was totally unaware that the ceasefire was in danger.And parallels are being drawn between the military intelligence blunder of last week and similar blunders before Internment Day and Operation Motorman – when politicians were advised that both moves would “help solve the Irish question”.

In , the party would have been openly pro-le. In , they’ve gone the opposite direction.“I also battled internally for the last two years to make sure I could be part of the Oireachtas team on an equal basis, but because I had a dference of opinion on the issue of abortion that just wasn’t allowed. I wasn’t given the chance to equally participate in the organisation.“For example, the leadership of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill and Mary Lou, went to London recently and asked Westminster to legislate on three separate areas for the North of Ireland – that’s unheard of in republican terms. For  years republicans have tried to stop them legislating on Ireland.”He continued: “The party is also caught in a way in that it wants to reach middle-Ireland more, maybe looking at winning seats in leafy liberal Dublinit can, reaching out to the media too, but there is a big danger that it will lose its grassroots base. I think the Presidential campaign was an example of where the grassroots became so disempowered that they didn’t come out for the organisation.”Mr Tóibín insists that Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Fianna Fáil, and Labour have positioned themselves on the same space, and that his party hopes to attract disillusioned members. Asked about his party’s policies, beyond being pro-le, Mr Tóibín said: “We are for the unity of the Irish people North and South and we will be reaching out the hand of friendship to people from a Protestant background, people who wouldn’t have been able to vote for Sinn Féin in the past, for many reasons. “We’ll also be reaching out to people who believe that the Tories have made such balderdash of Brexit, and have had their rights to self-determination taken away with regards to remaining in the EU. For us, economic justice issues are very important. Right now we have people in the North who are in food poverty, housing poverty, health poverty and yet we have stalemate at Stormont.”He contined: “We need the governments to institute joint authority in the North. We also need to make sure that there is serious work done on the All-Ireland economy. It was sold to us as part of the Good Friday Agreement, but it had fallen off the agenda for many political parties. It will be one of the greatest tools toameliorate the effects of Brexit. “Another point, and I think, Sinn Féin have been remiss on this, we want an independence referendum, but we can start to deconstruct the border in the meantime. “The border is made up of thousands of dferent bricks, which stand for a practical experience in someone’s le. It could be a cross-border ambulance service, a cross-border health service, cross-border education, or corporation tax – a cross-border soccer team. Every time we fix those issues, we create convergence North and South, we improve the delivery of services and the quality of le for people, and the height of the border starts to reduce in height.”Mr Tóibín has said his party hopes to stand between  to  candidates across Ireland, and has already attracted nine elected councillors. Asked about the number of candidates standing in Belfast, Mr Tóibín said: “We won’t get into the micro details just yet. Hundreds of people are joining us on a weekly basis. New cumainn are being set up around the country, and we have new cumainn that will be set up in Belfast. “We want to make sure that we are an activist based grassroots organisation. If we get that infrastructure set up around the six counties then we hope to be selecting candidates by early February in places we believe we can win seats.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-24-at-16.25.07.png","title":"womens place in national debate","story":"LAST year was a year to remember for women’s rights. ‘Me Too’ was a phrase heard around the globe as artists in many spheres made sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination visible. It was a lesson that went way beyond the arts.The referendum on the th Amendment to the Irish constitution made the experience of women visible in multiple ways. It was not merely about the personal heartbreak of inidual women, it was also about systemic oppression of Irish women and children, and reached into the earth of Tuam, County Galway, where babies’ bodies had been buried in an unconsecrated septic tank by nuns and priests.It was the year that celebrated  years of some women’s franchise and paid homage to suffragettes and the first woman MP, Constance Markievitz.With the election of Clare Bailey as leader of the Green Party we now have women leaders of four of the six mainparties. In many ways it all seemed seminal. That women’s agendas could no longer be ignored. However, we are all too aware of its limitations too. The words ‘The North is Next’ regarding access to full choices in pregnancy clearly require the addition of ‘at some point’.Women’s participation in politics, while improving, remains poor. In the forthcoming council election watch how many women are standing in winnable seats and watch which parties do what. A fair enough group photo of gender balance announcing candidates is often at quite a distance from the elected officials’ photograph afterwards.Just as in , contemporary strides on women’s rights need to be carefully looked after in the years to come. While Cumann na mBan and feminism were integral to the operation of the First Dáil and the appropriation of public le during the Tan War, what we witnessed afterwards was an assault on women’s rights, from the constitution to the maternity ward afterwards. In the north the oppression of women went hand in glove with the oppression of the nationalist population in the right wing statelet.Right now, there is a conversation happening about what a new Ireland might look like. The conversation focuses on constitutional rights, economic interests and demographics. Campaigns feed into it with social and cultural rights featuring intermittently.What we have failed to do is insert the vibrant and rich debate last year on women’s rights into this national debate in the meaningful way. For instance, women who cannot be equal participants in our society because their citizenship and culture are denied to them are doubly oppressed as women are unequal participants in so many avenues of le.Just as in - when Irish suffragettes gave expression to their fight for self-determination being linked to their country’s fight for self-determination, we need to seek out space and language for a modern Irish women’s vision. Indeed, in those years Irish suffragettes’ colours were not purple white and green – they were orange, white and green. It was a bold statement of intent: that women would not be written out of the Proclamation or a new Ireland.That new Ireland was never realised with the imposition of partition. Specic attention must now be paid to women’s participation, needs and aspirations as we build our new vision for a transformed Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"nodeal brexit could cost northern ireland 5bn a year","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

a \"major dilemma\"there is a no-deal scenario.\"Ireland has obligations to protect the single market, the United Kingdom would have a responsibility to abide by World Trade Organisation rules, and both the United Kingdom and Ireland would have responsibilities to honour the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process,\" he said.\"So I think wed end up in a situation whereby the EU and Ireland

he rejected Mr Varadkars \"analysis\" and called on him to work \"constructively\" to reach a consensus.\"It is not a constructive contribution when we are focused on trying to reach a consensus,\" the North Belfast MP said.\"In any case, the Taoiseach’s comments about the Belfast Agreement actually ride a coach and horses through that Agreement. \"Mr Varadkar is evidently and understandably concerned about the impact of a ‘no deal’ on the Republic of Ireland but this is a time to tone down the rhetoric and keep cool

It also facilitates the ongoing immigration co-operation arrangements that are already in place.The proposals also aim to ensure there is protection in place for consumers who have already bought financial service products before the date of Brexit.On energy, the Bill will allow for the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market in the context of a no-deal Brexit, pending longer term provisions in this area.A Government spokesman said ministers will work closely with opposition parties to ensure necessary legislation is passed through the Oireachtas before the UK leaves the EU at the end of March.This would mean that at committee stage, the proposed legislation could be debated on the floor of the House instead of at committees to help speed up the process of the legislation becoming enacted."},{"url":null,"title":"bank must make right call on interest rates if nodeal brexit mark carney says","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Natasha’s father, Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, said the family are asking for labels to list the  well-known allergens as well as the full ingredients.“Because, particularly people today more than ever, have allergies, severe allergies to many things, not just those  particular things,” he told the programme.“So it allows people who may have an allergy to something  to see the ingredients and not buy that product therefore save their le.“This is le-saving issues, it is not just a convenience or a fashion, or a trend or a fad, it is about lives, and lives really,

Under current rules, food prepared on the premises in which it is sold is not required to display allergen information on the package.But under the proposed reforms, published on Friday by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, outlets selling pre-packaged food could be required to follow new labelling rules, including a full list of ingredients required by law.The department said the consultation was designed to give the UK’s two million food allergy sufferers greater confidence in the safety of what they are eating.Appearing alongside her husband, Natasha’s mother, Tanya, said what happened was the “biggest fear a parent ever has for their child when they have allergies”.She said that, as parents, they understand how those who have children with allergies live their lives every day, how they feel and how frightening it is.“We couldn’t not do this,” she said of the drive to push for food labelling reform.“This is in Natasha’s name and it is what she would want because she lived with it, she knew how hard it was.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Environment Secretary Michael Gove Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who has discussed the consultation with Natasha’s parents, said he wanted to ensure food labels were clearer and rules for businesses more consistent.He added: “Natasha’s parents have suffered a terrible loss, and I want to pay tribute to Nadim and Tanya for their inspirational work to deliver Natasha’s law.“We want to ensure that labels are clearer and that the rules for businesses are more consistent – so that allergy sufferers in this country can have confidence in the safety of their food.“Many businesses are already bringing changes on board independently, and in the meantime they should continue doing all they can to give consumers the information they need.”The proposed reforms cover labelling requirements for foods that are packed on the same premises from which they are sold – such as a packaged sandwich or salad made by staff earlier in the day and placed on a shelf for purchase.Currently, these foods are not required to carry labels, and information on allergens can be given in person by the food businessasked by the customer.The department is urging businesses and allergy sufferers to have their say on four options being put forward to change the way allergy advice is provided on these foods.Proposals include mandating full ingredient listing, allergen-only labelling, “ask the staff” labels on all products, or promoting “best practice around communicating allergen information to consumers”.The consultation on proposed amendments to the domestic Food Information Regulations  will run for nine weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"possibility of a second brexit referendum has

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder. The line out was won, but Malone forced a crucial turnover and the chance went begging.Both sides continued to be careless in possession in a niggly match, which was low on quality.On  minutes a Malone breakdown penalty gave lsquoHinch a chance to drive for the line and as they progressed, Malone blatantly killed the ball and could count themselves lucky not to receive a yellow. Wright slotted the penalty to close the gap to two points.Following a Malone penalty miss, lsquoHinch botched their own line out allowing the home side to pile into the . Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card. Malone then scored from a tap penalty to take a - half-time lead.The second half followed a similar pattern to the first with Ballynahinch going further behind to another try from the prolic Campbell after another lsquoHinch mistake on their own line out.Ross Adair reduced the arrears on  minutes with a converted try to put lsquoHinch in bonus point territory and the away side belatedly roused themselves to pile the pressure on Malone during the final ten minutes.However, the home defence held and lsquoHinch had to settle for a point, earned largely through the woes of the Malone place kicker, who failed to land any of his attempts on goal.A disappointing start to  for the locals and they will need to be more accurate this week as Ballymena come to Ballymacarn Park.Malone Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygowan’s Emma hoping to make waves at Abu Dhabi Special Olympics  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN swimmer is hoping to make a big splash when she goes to the Middle East in March.Twenty three year-old Emma Carlisle will be going for gold when she swims for Ireland at the  Special Olympics World Summer Games in Abu Dhabi.Emma is one of seven athletes from Co Down included in the -strong Team Ireland squad for the Games which take place over March -.Newry is well represented with four athletes selected.

She suffered from the heart condition Tricuspid Atresia.Mrs Trainor has described the decision to send babies to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool after the provincersquos paediatric pathologist retired as ldquoinhumane.She believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.In addition, Mrs Trainor believes the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.Addressing last weekrsquos meeting, Mrs Trainor described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service, knowing that a senior pathologist was retiring.ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le, she said.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.ldquoI am not sure what provision would be in place for parents to accompany the child, but to send them on such a journey is heartbreaking. The entire family circle suffers when something like this happens.Mrs Trainor said the decision to hold post-mortems in England was the ldquosingle, most horrying thing she has ever heard.She continued: ldquoThe health service never ceases to amaze me and once again due to a lack of foresight, planning and finance, we find ourselves in what is an unforgivable situation, she continued, commending Newry, Mourne and Down Council for recently highlighting the post mortem issue.ldquoI am not the only person who has lost a child, quite a few people have and there are those who would join me to meet with Mr Pengelly to explain that sending babies across the water for post mortem is just not acceptable.The health campaigner believes there must be a paediatric pathologist who is prepared to provide cover in Northern Ireland, admitting she would also be in favour of an all island service.ldquoSending babies away is not an option and while an all island option is better than sending babies to Liverpool, I believe we must have this service provided here, she declared. ldquoWe need to meet with the Permanent Secretary as soon as possible on this vital issue.Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady said it was his understanding that there were strains on pathology services across the province due to workforce issues.ldquoIssues like this happen over a period of time and you sometimes wonder just how much attention is given to the planning aspect, he said.ldquoHow do officials plan for the future  It is not just enough to commission a report on the issue and put it in the bottom drawer and announce you are several thousand nurses short when you have had ample opportunity over several years to train more.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, who attended last weekrsquos meeting in Downpatrick, said holding post-mortems in England ldquowill bring untold pain and suffering to families in their darkest hour.He added: ldquoWe must do everything within our power to try and bring a resolution to this resource issue including examining a North-South approach. Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

The ingredient was not listed on the label.In the wake of her death her parents have been calling for a new so-called ldquoNatasharsquos Law to make all pre-packaged food clearly display allergen information.Nadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse met Environment Secretary Michael Gove to call for a change in the law to require all foods to be labelled clearly with any allergens A Government consultation has since been launched into food labelling laws focusing on overhauling the labelling of pre-prepared foods which are made, packaged and sold in-store.Speaking on ITVrsquos Good Morning Britain, Natasharsquos father, Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, said the family are asking for labels to list the  well-known allergens as well as the full ingredients.ldquoBecause, particularly people today more than ever, have allergies, severe allergies to many things, not just those  particular things, he told the programme.ldquoSo it allows people who may have an allergy to something  to see the ingredients and not buy that product therefore save their le.ldquoThis is le-saving issues, it is not just a convenience or a fashion, or a trend or a fad, it is about lives, and lives really, really matter.Under current rules, food prepared on the premises in which it is sold is not required to display allergen information on the package.But under the proposed reforms, published on Friday by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, outlets selling pre-packaged food could be required to follow new labelling rules, including a full list of ingredients required by law.The department said the consultation was designed to give the UKrsquos two million food allergy sufferers greater confidence in the safety of what they are eating.Appearing alongside her husband, Natasharsquos mother, Tanya, said what happened was the ldquobiggest fear a parent ever has for their child when they have allergies.She said that, as parents, they understand how those who have children with allergies live their lives every day, how they feel and how frightening it is.ldquoWe couldnrsquot not do this, she said of the drive to push for food labelling reform.ldquoThis is in Natasharsquos name and it is what she would want because she lived with it, she knew how hard it was.Environment Secretary Michael Gove Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who has discussed the consultation with Natasharsquos parents, said he wanted to ensure food labels were clearer and rules for businesses more consistent.He added: ldquoNatasharsquos parents have suffered a terrible loss, and I want to pay tribute to Nadim and Tanya for their inspirational work to deliver Natasharsquos law.ldquoWe want to ensure that labels are clearer and that the rules for businesses are more consistent ndash so that allergy sufferers in this country can have confidence in the safety of their food.ldquoMany businesses are already bringing changes on board independently, and in the meantime they should continue doing all they can to give consumers the information they need.The proposed reforms cover labelling requirements for foods that are packed on the same premises from which they are sold ndash such as a packaged sandwich or salad made by staff earlier in the day and placed on a shelf for purchase.Currently, these foods are not required to carry labels, and information on allergens can be given in person by the food businessasked by the customer.The department is urging businesses and allergy sufferers to have their say on four options being put forward to change the way allergy advice is provided on these foods.Proposals include mandating full ingredient listing, allergen-only labelling, ldquoask the staff labels on all products, or promoting ldquobest practice around communicating allergen information to consumers.The consultation on proposed amendments to the domestic Food Information Regulations  will run for nine weeks..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uNatasha us law u on food labels is about saving lives, says allergy girl us father article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed. According to the CBI, its analysis of government figures published at the end of last year showsthe UK fails to secure a deal with the EU, by , GVA could be “.% lower than under the UK’s current arrangements with the EU according to government analysis”. The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come. It’s time to put prosperity before party politics and dogma.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tud_1.jpg","title":"lifestyle a rolex for the next generation","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew gets hands-on with the flagship of watchmaker Tudor’s revamped line-up and examines the lineage of the luxury Swiss brand While Tudor’s fresh line-up of watches is somewhat of a deviation from its roots, it’s important to understand where the independent Swiss brand sits in the world of horology.The brand dates back as far as , when it was transferred to Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf. It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
