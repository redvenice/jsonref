Top high street stores plan to ditch Black...Share this articleThe UK Gift Card \u0026amp Voucher Association believes that anyone buying a gift card should include the receipt as part of the present. It will show the recipient how long they have got to spend the voucher while the receipt may also be used to claim money back or get a voucher replacement if a card is lost.Max Daniels, of the trade organisation, says: ‘Customers can be confused by the terms and conditions, so check online before making a purchase and let your recipient know about them.’Retailers John Lewis, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Waterstones and WH Smith offer vouchers that last 24 months. But if the balance on the card is checked during this period, the time-expiry clock automatically resets back to two years. Others are even less generous. Ticketmaster vouchers expire after a year. Gift cards for small shops and regional beauty boutiques may last for only half this time. For example, The Boutique Wellness Spa in Cambridge and the Orchid Beauty Spa in Birmingham both sell vouchers valid for only six months.          Expiry: Retailers John Lewis, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Waterstones and WH Smith offer vouchers that last 24 monthsWith an Amazon gift card, the time limit is a comparatively generous ten years. Apple Store and iTunes cards do not have expiry dates but the ‘content codes’ printed on them may need to be updated if the cards are not used straightaway. National Book Tokens do not expire for eight years though those purchased before October 2015 automatically expired after two years if not used. But the provider will replace out-of-date vouchers upon request.Theatre Tokens, which can be used for shows at more than 240 venues nationwide, come with no strings attached. If a gift card is lost without a receipt, then usually the balance on it is also lost.          Also, when a retailer gets into financial difficulties, a gift card can often become worthless or extra conditions imposed on its usage.For example, when British Home Stores went into administration a couple of years ago, anyone who had one of its gift cards could only use it if the card amount was at least matched by non-voucher spending.For example, a voucher worth £20 could only be used to buy something costing at least £40.Other shops that have gone bust in recent years, including HMV and Jessops, left those with gift cards stranded with a worthless piece of paper or plastic. Limited protection is provided by Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act which protects buyers of gift cards for £100 or more, provided the purchase was made by a credit card. Vouchers worth less than £100 are not covered.Another downside of a gift card is that it is restrictive. Unwanted cards can be put up for sale on websites such as Zeek.me. Sellers must accept a sum less than a card’s face value while Zeek takes a seven per cent commission cut. \u0026#xA318.99 per month for 10Mbps \u0026#xA3150 Expedia vouchers or free tech"},{"url":null,"title":"Woman engaged CHANDELIER gets tattoo partner dreams arm","story":"    Amanda Liberty, 34, from Leeds, has had a picture of her fiancée, a chandelier called Lumiere, tattooed on her arm           Ms Liberty is in an open relationship with her chandelier collection, revealing that she is engaged to one named Lumiere (not pictured)The tattoo took one and a half hours to complete and Ms Liberty said she felt \u0027nervous about the needle\u0027 before getting inked, reports the Mirror.However Ms Liberty was pleased with the end result and said: \u0027Lumiere also thought it was brilliant, she gave me the energy telling me it was great.\u0027She tells me when she doesn\u0027t like things but she really likes the tattoo.\u0027Ms Liberty first fell in love with a drum kit at the age of fourteen and has since gone on to love the iconic Statue of Liberty, even changing her surname by deed poll to Liberty.          Amanda says that after seeing Lumiere (pictured) online it was love at first sight and she proposed to the light fitting on Valentine\u0027s Day          While she may be set to marry Lumiere Amanda goes to bed with another chandelier, Jewel, as she is portable Amanda said: \u0027As soon as I saw Lumiere on eBay, I knew immediately that she was the one for me and it was love at first sight.\u0027She was based in Germany and although I knew it would be tricky to get her home, I knew I needed to find a way to make her mine.\u0027I couldn\u0027t stop thinking about her and how beautiful she was - she has such a beautiful shape, and I could feel really amazing energy coming from her.\u0027After buying the chandelier, I patiently waited for her to be imported into the UK and after six days of waiting, she was finally in my arms.\u0027She had been disassembled for her own safety, but once I put all her pieces together and she settled in to her new home, our relationship just went from strength to strength.          Amanda, who identifies as Objectum Sexual, says that her chandeliers are not jealous of one another \u0027A friend of mine actually named her Lumiere because of the film Beauty and The Beast, after the candlestick who comes alive.\u0027Last Valentine\u0027s Day I proposed to her, to signify our long lasting love.\u0027I hope at some point we will have a commitment ceremony - I haven\u0027t been engaged before so it\u0027s very new and exciting!\u0027In December 2017 Ms Liberty said she prefered to spend her nights cuddled up to Jewel, a portable chandelier that she happily tucks in to bed with her.Lumiere and Jewel are part of a 25 strong chandelier collection that Amanda owns, and even though she is only engaged to Lumiere, she considers herself to be in an \u0027open relationship\u0027 with the others.She identifies herself as Objectum Sexual, which means that she is attracted to objects.Amanda first fell in love with a drum kit aged 14, before falling in love with the Statue of Liberty years after, whom she affectionately refers to as \u0027Libby\u0027.          She first fell in love with a drum kit age 14 before moving on to the Statue of Liberty, but after dedicating her life and decor to the landmark, she says the relationship was too long distance          Amanda says that Jewel is more comfortable to sleep with and nice to cuddle in bed Amanda, who changed her surname by Deed Poll in 2010 to Liberty, has travelled to the USA a total of six times to meet the real thing.Her living room is adorned with memorabilia dedicated to the monument and despite insisting that she still loves Libby, the long distance between them left her lonely.She now happily resides with her many chandeliers at home, many of whom she has restored to pristine condition.Amanda said: \u0027None of my chandeliers are jealous of each other, they understand that I love them all for all of their different personalities.\u0027For example, I love kissing and cuddling Lumiere, but I sleep with Jewel every night, as she is portable and very nice to cuddle.\u0027I\u0027ve always loved the look of chandeliers and when I saw my first chandelier, Luna, it was love at first sight.          Amanda insists that her feelings are completely natural, and she\u0027s happy with her companions\u0027You can\u0027t control who you fall in love with and things just went from there.\u0027I spend my spare time restoring old and broken chandeliers to their former glory, which I really enjoy as I can tell that they enjoy the attention that they receive.\u0027My dream job would be to work in public buildings such as Buckingham Palace, looking after the grand chandeliers that they have there.\u0027Despite her unique relationships, Amanda insists that her feelings are completely natural, and she\u0027s happy with her companions.Amanda said: \u0027People often can\u0027t understand that this is just a natural orientation for me, that I can find the beauty in objects and can sense their energy.\u0027I want others to see how happy the chandeliers make me, and how much they\u0027ve enriched my life.\u0027I\u0027m not hurting anyone by entering in to a relationship with them, I am simply just following my heart.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Al Pacino play King Lear film adaptation Shakespeare play","story":"Proud mother!

The most she knows about this subject is when her grandparents’ cat was put to sleep, so I have no idea where this is coming from.I’ve always prided myself on being an entirely rational, practical and sensible woman. A journalist for the past 17 years, I like facts and evidence. I am not superstitious, nor do I believe in ghosts.Which is just as well. My husband Adrian, 40, works away in London during the week, so it is largely just myself and Rosalyn in our North Devon house, which dates back to the 1500s.Man who hid £310,000 in washing machine is arrested for...Share this articleOur nearest neighbours are half a mile away and we live in the middle of a wood. I simply cannot allow myself to be scared by — let alone believe in — the supernatural.But this isn’t the first time Rosalyn has spooked me. When she was 18 months old, I remember how she pointed to an outside cellar door and was adamant she could see sheep. I dismissed it at the time, but she kept shouting: ‘Look, Mummy, sheep, sheep!’ A few weeks later, we walked past again and she announced with a sad face: ‘Sheep gone now, Mummy.’Although aware our house is built on the site of old sheep farming cottages, I put it to the back of my mind. After all, Rosalyn was just grappling with the rudiments of speech she could have meant anything.          Rosalyn outside her home in north Devon where she claims to have seen ghostsBut now she’s three, and much more articulate and focused. And she continues to tell me about Tilly and Alex. No wonder I have started to feel unsettled in our home of three years. Although I don’t believe in ghosts, I would be lying if I said the idea of them didn’t scare me. There is so much in life we don’t understand, so much we don’t know, and there are so many accounts of people saying they’ve seen things they cannot rationally explain.I decided to do some digging, in an effort to convince myself that there is nothing to Rosalyn’s imaginings.I wish I hadn’t.Census records for 1861 show there was a ten-year-old boy called Alexander Turner living here. And records for 30 years later, in 1891, list a Matilda Oke, aged 20. Records are patchy from this time, so it’s very likely that Matilda was living here when she was much younger.Although I am struggling to convince myself that Alex, Tilly and the visiting flock of sheep are nothing more than the creation of a toddler’s vivid imagination, a recent study reveals that one in five Britons claims to have experienced the presence of a ghost.I did some research and discovered that there are many rational parents in the same position as me — with children like the little boy, played by Haley Joel Osment, in the film The Sixth Sense — who say they ‘see dead people’.Take mother-of-six Katie Jones, 33, a carer from Canterbury, Kent. She has an 11-year-old daughter Alice, who, from the age of two, has spoken of seeing people who are no longer here. Katie, who is married to landlord Gareth, 47, explains: ‘When Alice was two, she started to cry a lot, saying there were two men in her room staring and shouting at her, and she didn’t like it.‘She then started to say that a girl called Sheila sat at the bottom of her bed crying for her mummy. I looked in old newspaper cuttings and found that there was a girl of that name murdered here. It chilled me to the core.‘Alice then told me that my grandmother, also named Alice, who died a year before my daughter was born, was coming into her bedroom. She said that Nanna had told the girl and the men to go away, and they had.’Katie says Alice would accurately describe the clothes her grandmother wore, something she couldn’t have known.‘When Alice was three, a family member had a stillborn baby. Alice told me that Nanna had been to see her with a baby in her arms. She said the baby was named Max. There is no way she could’ve known this. We hadn’t told her about the baby or his name — she was too little to understand.‘As the years have passed, she still says Max and Nanna are there. She even told me it was Max’s fourth birthday and, when I checked, she was right. She had the correct day and age.’Katie continues: ‘When she was four, I remember her telling me that she had to give our next-door neighbour a message. Her husband had just died of cancer and she wanted to tell her to stop crying as he had told her he was fine.‘When she first started saying things, I brushed it off as the chatter of a little girl, but the more it happened the more I came to realise she was telling the truth. Now I have no doubt she has a gift.‘She has always felt comforted by her Nanna, but there have been some bad experiences. In our old house, she kept saying she saw a boy and she’d refuse to go upstairs. She’d stand there screaming, saying the boy wouldn’t let her go past. It used to really scare me.’Now aged 11, Alice says that she’s seeing things less and less, but can clearly remember seeing her great-grandmother. ‘I always felt safe with my Nanna there, and I remember seeing the baby, too. I also remember it being his birthday.‘I only feel scared when it’s someone I don’t know, but I see them less now. To any other children who see things like this, I would say you don’t have to be scared, as they are just looking out for you and trying to protect you.’          Tricia Jordan pictured with her son Luca, sevenDr Stephen Westgarth, a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, a consultant child psychiatrist and medical director of Child Psychiatry UK, says such behaviour is normal for a young child.‘Children’s imaginative worlds are limitless, and don’t contain the same social and physical rules of the adult world.‘As a parent, I wouldn’t be worried about a child experiencing these episodes and, in some ways, it can be viewed as very positive, because it shows that they have a vivid and well-defined imagination.‘The normal situation would be that, as the child grows and the brain develops, they begin to rationalise what they are experiencing and so the episodes will begin to wane.’He says he has dealt with families who say their children are talking to ‘the beyond’, but says these tended to be spiritualists and strong believers in the afterlife, so there was a culture there already.Yet, like me, mother-of-two Tricia Jordan is not clairvoyant, but she is in no doubt that her son talks to the dead.The 32-year-old medical secretary says her seven-year-old son, Luca, has been ‘seeing’ her dead grandmother since he was a baby, which used to scare her, but she now feels comforted by it.Tricia, from Newport, Gwent, who is married to postman Stuart, 37, and also has a four-year-old son, Bobby, says: ‘My grandmother passed away when Luca was 18 months old. He had just started to speak, and the first thing he told me was how Granny would tuck him up in bed. I found it really strange. It used to scare me, and I’d change the subject.‘One of the eeriest things was him singing The Big Ship Sails On The Ally-Ally-O, which she always sang to me. He would sing it over and over, and tell me how Granny was there. I had never sung it to him. There is no way he could have known this song.‘As time went on, I realised he wasn’t scared so it was all right.’She describes another encounter when he was four: ‘One day, we passed a house near our home. He told me it was Martin’s house but he wasn’t there because he died in a fire. I checked the names on a census and a Martin had lived there. This really scared me.’Luca hasn’t had any spooky sightings for some years, and today he has no memory of seeing his dead grandmother.Tricia says that, while she has always believed in an afterlife, what she has experienced with her son has left her utterly convinced that the dead walk among us.She says: ‘I have always believed a little bit, but what I have seen with Luca blew my mind. It made me believe completely.’          Six-year-old Riley has talked to people his mother Hollie could not seeHollie Smith from New Addington, South London, also shares this conviction. She is certain her six-year-old son, Riley, has seen ghosts. The 32-year-old, who runs a party business with husband Colin, 40, says he has experienced too many things to leave her in any doubt as to their validity.She says: ‘When he was two, we were out walking when he started pointing and waving, saying, “Look, Mummy, there’s a soldier, he’s waving at us.” There was no one there. He was so excited and animated. He then looked so disappointed when he told me the soldier had gone. I believed him. He was too little to make something like that up.‘Surprisingly, I didn’t feel scared. I almost felt like it was a precious experience that someone from another life wanted to say hello.’Hollie also recalls another instance when Riley was around 18 months old. ‘I walked into his bedroom and he was having a conversation with someone. His language was limited, but he was talking and answering and gesturing with someone who wasn’t there.‘I asked him who it was. He said it was Humpty. He kept on telling me for days afterwards that Humpty was there. At the time, our neighbour had just died, a man who was very overweight. I had never sung this nursery rhyme to Riley. Maybe he’d picked it up elsewhere, but I think he was talking to our neighbour.’Riley also had an imaginary friend at pre-school called George, who was so real to him that he was the only child he played with. She adds: ‘Yes, it could be nothing more than an imaginary friend, but in the context of these other things, I’m not so sure.Celebrity psychic Honor Broxap believes such sightings should not be dismissed. ‘We are all born with a sixth sense,’ she says. ‘Yet we stop using it as we get older. Children are much more believing, less questioning or cynical. They have not yet been conditioned to think that it’s all just nonsense.          Alice, 11, said she has seen a number of ghosts from the age of three‘You have to be careful that you don’t over-exaggerate it. Yes, children do have a vivid imagination, but more often than not, there is some truth in it.’Clairvoyant medium and psychic artist Jackie Dennison agrees: ‘Children have imaginary friends. Maybe, it is just that, but perhaps it is sometimes more. They are very open to spirits and are unfazed by them. They take things in their stride. I believe we can also see layers of time, memories and echoes of what was once there.’Jackie says that this might explain the sheep in my cellar, and, with regards to Tilly and Alex, she tells me not to worry about them: ‘I think the fact that they’re in your home is quite amazing. They are obviously happy that you’re living there as a family.’Although I don’t share this sense of wonderment, I’m starting to feel a touch more at ease as to whatever is going on in my home. Rosalyn is happy, and also very young.

Ticketmaster vouchers expire after a year. Gift cards for small shops and regional beauty boutiques may last for only half this time. For example, The Boutique Wellness Spa in Cambridge and the Orchid Beauty Spa in Birmingham both sell vouchers valid for only six months.

Apple Store and iTunes cards do not have expiry dates but the ‘content codes’ printed on them may need to be updated if the cards are not used straightaway. National Book Tokens do not expire for eight years though those purchased before October 2015 automatically expired after two years if not used. But the provider will replace out-of-date vouchers upon request.Theatre Tokens, which can be used for shows at more than 240 venues nationwide, come with no strings attached. If a gift card is lost without a receipt, then usually the balance on it is also lost.          Also, when a retailer gets into financial difficulties, a gift card can often become worthless or extra conditions imposed on its usage.For example, when British Home Stores went into administration a couple of years ago, anyone who had one of its gift cards could only use it if the card amount was at least matched by non-voucher spending.For example, a voucher worth £20 could only be used to buy something costing at least £40.Other shops that have gone bust in recent years, including HMV and Jessops, left those with gift cards stranded with a worthless piece of paper or plastic. Limited protection is provided by Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act which protects buyers of gift cards for £100 or more, provided the purchase was made by a credit card. Vouchers worth less than £100 are not covered.Another downside of a gift card is that it is restrictive. Unwanted cards can be put up for sale on websites such as Zeek.me. Sellers must accept a sum less than a card’s face value while Zeek takes a seven per cent commission cut. \u0026#xA318.99 per month for 10Mbps \u0026#xA3150 Expedia vouchers or free tech"},{"url":null,"title":"Puppy Gilbert lost use hind legs accidentally trodden gets doggy wheelchair","story":"    Gilbert, a Hungarian Vizsla puppy, has not been able to use his hind legs since he was accidentally trodden on when he was five days old          A vet advised owners Jane and Kevin Bircumshaw, from Bournemouth, to have Gilbert put down as his spinal injuries were so severe but they refused to give up on himThey found a company that specialises in making \u0027wheelchairs\u0027 for dogs and one was built for Gilbert and the contraption is strapped to his back with the two wheels acting as his legs.The most unlikely of friends!

Amanda says that after seeing Lumiere (pictured) online it was love at first sight and she proposed to the light fitting on Valentine\u0027s Day          While she may be set to marry Lumiere Amanda goes to bed with another chandelier, Jewel, as she is portable Amanda said: \u0027As soon as I saw Lumiere on eBay, I knew immediately that she was the one for me and it was love at first sight.\u0027She was based in Germany and although I knew it would be tricky to get her home, I knew I needed to find a way to make her mine.\u0027I couldn\u0027t stop thinking about her and how beautiful she was - she has such a beautiful shape, and I could feel really amazing energy coming from her.\u0027After buying the chandelier, I patiently waited for her to be imported into the UK and after six days of waiting, she was finally in my arms.\u0027She had been disassembled for her own safety, but once I put all her pieces together and she settled in to her new home, our relationship just went from strength to strength.

Today, when she should be reunited with her five children, she is being hunted across Pakistan, forced to scuttle under cover of darkness from one safe house to another in fear of her life.It is a desperate situation – and one not helped by Britain which refuses to offer the mother-of-five sanctuary.Last month the Supreme Court in Pakistan decided that Asia, 52, who spent eight years on death row, had been falsely accused of blasphemy against the Prophet Mohammed. While most of the country erupted in fury at her release, nowhere did the anger burn more fiercely than in her home village of Ittan Wali, 40 miles south-east of Lahore, where her extraordinary ordeal began. Following news of her reprieve, women took to the streets to protest, a bus was torched and children ran riot.Until now, beyond a few sketchy details, little about Asia’s persecution has been forthcoming. But last week The Mail on Sunday travelled to Ittan Wali and interviewed key witnesses, spoke to Asia’s trusted friends and unearthed court documents. What emerged was a story far more shocking than previously imagined.          Since her release from prison, Mrs Bibi has faced constant death threats from angry mobsOur investigation can reveal that, on the day she was seized by villagers and accused of blasphemy:Asia’s forefathers have lived in Ittan Wali since before the formation of Pakistan in 1947. For decades, they have been the only Christians among 300 Muslim families.The village is wholly unremarkable – a collection of mud brick single-storey houses and dirt tracks skirted by open sewers – but it was home to Asia. And although she was frequently harassed and entreated to convert to Islam, she refused to budge.She lived with her husband, Ashiq Masih, and two stepdaughters, one stepson, and two daughters of her own in a single room mud brick house.Back in 2009, Asia’s husband was working as a labourer in a local brick kiln. But with four children to feed – the couple’s eldest daughter was married – Asia often worked as a farmhand to bring in extra money.At dawn on June 14, Asia and 25 other women went to work picking falsa berries, similar to blackcurrants, in a field owned by the village’s richest man Muhammad Idrees. She was paid 250 rupees (£1.50) a day.That morning was a Sunday, so her husband had no work. She left the house quietly, with Ashiq, now 62, and the four children fast asleep on the large bed they all shared.At midday, when the baking Punjab heat reached 110F (43C), Asia went to a nearby hand pump and returned with a bucket of water to share with her colleagues and a tin cup. Two sisters, Asma Bibi and Mafia Bibi (who aren’t related to Asia), turned on her, saying: ‘This cup was intended for Muslims, why did you take the water from it?’They said she had made the water impure, because she was ‘chura’, a derogatory term which means ‘low-caste’, used for Christians.The two sisters then urged Asia to convert to Islam, so she wouldn’t be chura any more – typical of the religious harassment she faced in Ittan Wali all her life.For once, instead of remaining meekly silent, Asia stood her ground. She said she would not convert, and asked why she, not her co-workers, should change religion.          Her trouble started when she drew water from this hand pump near Ittan Wali village It has been claimed that she disparaged the Prophet Mohammed during the heated discussion that followed. She emphatically denies this – and insists the allegations were invented to frame her.If so, it is a scenario familiar to many of the nearly three million Christians in Pakistan, out of a total population of 165 million. The blasphemy laws, it is widely acknowledged, have long been used against them, not as a system of organised persecution, but simply as a way of settling petty disputes.After the row, Asia ran back home crying and told Ashiq what had happened. He told her not to worry, and he seemed to be correct as there were no further incidents for the next five days.But on Friday, the Muslim religious day, Asia returned to work in the falsa fields, unaware that a mile away, the village imam, Qari Muhammad Salaam, was stirring up the villagers by announcing on the mosque loudspeakers that she had committed blasphemy.The first she was aware of any trouble was hearing a low rumble of voices, then the terrifying chant: ‘Kill the Christian!’She realised the men were coming for her and soon they appeared on a ridge. She had nowhere to run. In a panic, she stumbled, dizzy with fear, and a minute or so later felt hands roughly grab her arms and shoulders while another man fitted a leather noose around her neck.Hauled to her feet, she was paraded back to the village – led by the leather strap – and taken to a courtyard in the house of the village leader, where more than 100 people had gathered, including imams from neighbouring villages. It seemed that a makeshift sharia court was being convened.The village imam was flanked by the two sisters and Asia was flung at his feet. He told her: ‘You’ve made derogatory remarks about our Prophet. You know what happens to people who insult the Prophet. You can redeem yourself by accepting Islam.’Asia protested her innocence and said she did not want to convert. At this, the crowd became increasingly hostile and began jeering and spitting. Asia was then whipped with sticks and sandals. Then, in a form of ritual humiliation, someone smeared her face with black dye while others held her down.One of Asia’s daughters tried to intervene but was grabbed by her hair and her face smashed against a door. Another daughter, Isham, then nine, could only watch, terrified and powerless.          Mrs Bibi lived with her family in this house in Ittan Wali village in Pakistan\u0027s Punjab regionAt one point Asia begged for water but the crowd shouted: ‘No water for the Christian dog.’ Another voice added: ‘Drink urine!’Then little Isham ran off to look for water and summon her father, who was out working.By now Asia was badly bleeding and semi-conscious. But when her husband reached the village, he was held back by the mob. Fearing he would be killed, he ran away.Witnesses said it was clear that villagers would have killed Asia but for the intervention of a teacher who argued that she should be handed to police.Two officers arrived 45 minutes later and she was taken away and formally charged with blasphemy.Two days later, Joseph Francis, of the Centre for Legal Aid Assistance and Settlement, a Christian group in Lahore, went to Ittan Wali to investigate.Villagers told him that Asma and Mafia, previously friends of Asia, were told to argue with her as a way of forcing her to either flee her home or convert to Islam. When The Mail on Sunday visited Ittan Wali last week, we found her house was occupied by another family.And from the moment of our arrival, our every move was shadowed. It later emerged that villagers had been instructed to tip off police about any Western visitors.We headed to the imam’s house, next to the mosque. A group of men in their early twenties followed our reporters and stood close by, staring, as we waited for the imam to answer the door. Eventually, a middle-aged man, dressed in a blue shalwar kameez, appeared and walked us to the mosque.Instructed to sit down on a mat in a courtyard, whose marble floors were caked with dirt, we waited for the imam to appear.When he joined us he appeared friendly, offering tea and water, though his demeanour changed when Asia’s case was mentioned. He seemed angry at Asia’s reprieve and warned ominously: ‘Everybody is prepared to sacrifice their lives for the respect of the Holy Prophet.’After Asia was charged with blasphemy, she was transferred to jail in the town of Sheikhupura, about 27 miles away.In November 2010, she was sentenced to death by hanging in a 30-minute hearing at a court in the town, with no cross-examination of any witnesses. The court erupted with joy as she was sentenced.The decision was upheld by Lahore High Court in 2014. In her written testimony, Asia insisted that the sisters and the imam conspired in a ‘false, fabricated and fictitious case against me’.

They all arrived modestly dressed, in flowing gowns (abayas), trousers covering the ankle, headscarves – and wonderful eye make-up.They were a sophisticated, highly educated and well-travelled group fashion designers, journalists, a financier. But nonetheless I found them baffling.When I asked about the traditional dress code they insisted that they weren’t under any pressure to dress this way and that it was entirely their choice not to be disrespectful to Emirati tradition. It marked them out from the masses of tourists and expats wandering around with their cut off denims and sleeveless dresses.Indeed, they didn’t voice a word of complaint about a single aspect of the society they inhabit, unlike us Westerners for whom complaining about our lot is a way of life. Most striking of all was their total acceptance of – indeed praise for – the staggering degree of surveillance in the UAE where the state monitors their every movement.          When asked about the traditional dress code women insisted that they weren’t under any pressure to dress this way and that it was entirely their choice (stock picture)Rather than finding the wall- to-wall CCTV cameras and the interception of their texts, WhatsApp and email a chilling invasion of their privacy, they lauded it as empowering.Far from objecting to the scrutiny, they all agreed it made them feel safer to go about their work and lives. ‘I can walk home alone from my studio at five in the morning without any fear,’ one explained. ‘In fact, I don’t know what I’d have to do to be raped here.’ Not a sentiment that I imagine is shared by the thousands of female, migrant workers locked into abusive domestic employment in the region.My dad’s tax tip: Just blow the lotOnce again there’s talk of reforming inheritance tax because the current system is too confusing. It’s a subject that generates a great deal of heat – despite the fact that, of the 570,000 people who die each year, only 30,000 leave large enough estates to qualify for it. Partly this is because inheritance tax tends to hit middle-class media commentators like me and partly because it’s distressing to have to deal with at a time of grief.There is, however, one way to avoid it which is the method adopted by my father.He felt that, in providing his offspring with a good education and comfortable childhood, he had fulfilled his financial obligations and there was no need for us to inherit anything.So he cheerfully spent every penny he had. My sole takeaway after his death was a white Perspex 1960s cigarette box which I nabbed as a nostalgic memento from the rented flat where we all lived.What’s the emoji for ‘I haven’t got a clue’?Last month Apple introduced 70 more emojis to the iPhone, including grey hair and bald heads so that nobody feels left out.But all those darling little symbols are wasted on me.I don’t speak emoji and can never understand what’s being said. With my slightly dodgy eyesight I can’t work out the different nuances of expression and I can never judge whether the tears streaming down the little face are of laughter or misery.These days it’s hard enough trying not to say the wrong thing to some constituency or other, without also having to worry whether you’ve posted an emoji that’s going to cause offence.Misery of a saggy bottomed ChristmasAlexandra Shulman\u0027s Notebook: Children are better off with both parents, Angelina...Alexandra Shulman\u0027s Notebook: When did Britain\u0027s dogs get so spoilt?

In the book he comes clean about all they have kept from each other: the gambling addiction they both have but never acknowledge his eating disorders and the sexual violence he experienced as a child. It’s a story about the weight of lies, secrecy and expectation and was shortlisted for the Kirkus prize and the Andrew Carnegie medal for excellence. The New York Times described it as “a gorgeous, gutting book that’s fuelled by candour yet freighted with ambivalence”. Laymon teaches creative writing at the University of Mississippi.You were raised by women – your mother and grandma – how was that?We hear about absent fathers but not present mothers. A present father wouldn’t have helped me at all, if he was modelling harmful behaviour daily. My grandmother, mother and aunt were pretty good at loving. They tried. They failed often. But their ability to love is why I’m talking to you today. My book is all about love. We can talk about the difference between black and white or Democrats and Republicans but if we don’t learn to love the people we purport to love, we have no chance. Trump says he loves America. Is there any proof of that? No. There’s absolutely no proof that that man loves America.Would Trump be a better man if he was raised by women?One of the most useful things that people like Kavanaugh and Trump show us is that having lots of money, a two-parent family and going to the best schools doesn’t necessarily produce the best men.Your mother wanted to protect you from the things that can happen to black boys – incarceration, gang violence, police violence. But in the end that harms you, too...White people in the US have been so violent to black folk, and there is a belief that if we present ourselves as perfect, we have a better chance of coming home, of not suffering, of getting more access to healthy choices and second chances. As a kid it struck me that Martin Luther King was dressed really well when he got murdered. Obama epitomises what my mom wanted me to be. She wanted me to be skinny, to talk like Obama, she wanted me to never confront white people in any sort of abrasive way. But people still called Obama a radical, said he was a Muslim and a terrorist. History says to me that respectable excellence does not liberate black people.You write about personal struggles – sexual violence, addiction, abuse. Which was the hardest to address?The gambling addiction that me and my mother had. The book starts with us raking up quarters on a casino floor, at a time when I had no concept of what an addiction is, and it’s the best feeling in the world. It ends with us reckoning with that addiction. We were working really hard to accumulate money that our family needed. And we were literally giving it all away.You were 210lb at 10 and 319lb by the time you were at university. Then you began to starve yourself. Tell me about being a man with an eating disorder…When I was a child, and later at grad school, I was gorging – looking for pizza in dorm bins, eating hunny-bun after hunny-bun, going to an all-you-can-eat buffet followed by a Dunkin’ Donuts. I still feel shame talking about that. But the scary thing is that, when I talk about when I starved myself I don’t feel embarrassed. Even though I was eating one meal every three days, the most unhealthy I’d ever been. I almost want you to know what I was capable of doing. Eating disorders aren’t flagged up for all people in the same way. When I was excessively working out, there would be skinny men in the gym, skinny gender-queer people, skinny black and brown folk… But the people who got pointed out as “anorexic” or “bulimic” were always white women. People would say: “Someone needs to stop her coming in here” and I’d think, she’s not even the skinniest person in here! I’m interested in why we can see disordered eating in white women, but not other people.What books are on your bedside table?I can’t tell you the name yet but it’s by one of my friends. It’s a letter to her two sons and it’s amazing. It came right on time. Sometimes with these epistolary books it’s easy to be really cheesy, really formulaic – the letter form can lend itself to a kind of one-dimensionality, but this writer manages to texture herself and her boys in really distinct ways. She does more than just lament or try to give them wisdom. She’s telling a complicated story about who they are, why they’re like that and where she thinks they should go.Are there any genres you avoid?I don’t read books about the economy.

They are as guilty of failing to face their own motives and contradictions as of deceiving the country. Their failure to be honest has produced the gravest political crisis since the Second World War. It has spread from the tight group around the TaxPayers’ Alliance and Vote Leave campaign to infect both left and right, which, even at this late stage, cannot level with the electorate.Allow me to start at the bottom with the little creatures who scurry around British conservatism’s fake grassroots, for that is where it began. The very name “the TaxPayers’ Alliance” is a kind of trick. The alliance isn’t the “grassroots campaign” it claims to be. Taxpayers cannot vote for its officials or dictate its policies. If taxpayers say austerity has gone too far, the alliance will not listen. It is a private company dedicated to producing a “pro-enterprise country with lower, simpler taxes”, whether taxpayers want them or not.So far, it looks like a standard front organisation of the type the far left and corporate right have been sending out to greet credulous journalists for decades. Although it keeps its donors secret, the  found that it was tied into the network of thinktanks, foundations and AstroTurf campaigns billionaires in the Koch brothers mould created to turn the west rightwards. Its belief in the stripped-down state won it evangelical approval and $100,000 from the Bahamas-based Templeton Religion Trust, even though the Jesus of the Gospels’ only utterance on fiscal policy was to tell his followers to render their tax returns unto Caesar.Theology aside, the underlying philosophy – if that is not too respectful a term – of the TaxPayers’ Alliance and Vote Leave makes little sense. Shahmir Sanni worked for both. Indeed, from Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave and a founder of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, down to IT staff, rightist activists bounced between the two.The culture of this little world was thoughtlessly libertarian, Sanni told me. If you defended the NHS or showed sympathy for those on welfare, you were a “wet”, an insult that performs the same function on the hard right as “centrist” does on the far left. Wets were at best guilty of faulty thinking and rank sentimentality. At worst, they were renegades. The wetness had to be wrung out of them.True believers had to admire Donald Trump for bashing the hated liberals and believe in Brexit as a matter of course. Political orthodoxy meant that men and women who claimed to have taxpayers’ interest close to their hard hearts never felt they needed to explain what they were doing to taxpayers. Brexit will hammer the tax base. You can take your pick of the forecasts. The UN special rapporteur’s analysis on poverty in the UK said: “Tax revenues will fall significantly. If current policies towards low-income working people and others living in poverty are maintained in the face of these developments, the poor will be substantially less well off.” City sources estimate that the Treasury could lose £10bn a year from the London financial sector alone.I could take this as a cue to excoriate Jeremy Corbyn and the far left, who spent their lives accusing Labour governments of “betrayal”, yet are ready to back a Brexit that will betray the poorest people and poorest regions in Britain. But frankly, if you haven’t clocked their political bankruptcy yet, you never will.As significant are the equally treacherous fiscal conservatives, who rushed to support a shuddering change that will place a greater burden on the taxpayers they claim to support. The conventional liberal-left explanation is that Vote Leave, the TaxPayers’ Alliance, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and all the other Tory politicians who marched under their banners are operating in the interests of the super-rich, not the 17.4 million people who voted to leave. The financiers behind the investment fund Jacob Rees-Mogg founded can neatly sidestep Brexit by moving assets into the EU the rest of us will be stuck with stagnation and decline.But there was never a coherent set of principles behind the Leave campaign, or even a logically thought-through class interest. Instead, there’s a jumble of contradictory imperatives, nurtured in groupthink and sustained by careerism: cut immigration boost the economy protect the hardworking taxpayer threaten the tax base. In what ought to be a notorious moment, Vote Leave refused to define what a vote for Brexit might mean for fear that its own supporters wouldn’t buy it and its flaws would become a target for the Remain campaign.In what is certainly its most despicable moment, the TaxPayers’ Alliance fired Sanni after he revealed to the Observer how Vote Leave had circumvented election spending limits. The Electoral Commission has vindicated his stance, but Stephen Parkinson, a Vote Leave director and aide to Theresa May, punished him by revealing that Sanni was gay. (Sanni is from a traditional Muslim family and Parkinson did not care if he destroyed his relationship with his parents.)The TaxPayers’ Alliance claims to defend the common man and woman from the overbearing state. It shares an address in Westminster with the libertarian Big Brother Watch, which “challenges threats to our privacy, our freedoms and our civil liberties”. Yet the clique’s first reaction to a whistleblower was to use the overbearing state to punish the heretic by invading his privacy.The men who led us into this crisis refused to think through what they were doing. It wasn’t so much that they were never honest with the country about Brexit. It was that they could never be honest with themselves. If they had, Britain’s position might now be less perilous."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31d20f3b4c31bed04ce5487341e0e077df13ae7/0_207_4157_2495/master/4157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b27aad8353a6e530422a223db9a63e0","title":"brexit britain europe also fractured","story":"The intense inwards focus in Westminster on last-minute Brexit dramas has tended to obscure the dire impact on Europe itself of Britain’s decision to leave the EU. It is a poignant moment. Across a continent beset by mounting internal and external problems, Britain’s departure will be interpreted by many as a stinging vote of no confidence in Europe’s collective future.With the summit in Brussels to seal the Brexit withdrawal agreements now expected to go ahead as planned, the remaining 27 member states have reached a portentous turning point that none of them ever really wanted.The British, generally speaking, have consistently misread their importance to Europe in the postwar period. Ideologically biased and ill-informed politicians are partly to blame. Irrationally Eurosceptic rightwing newspapers have also exerted a baleful influence. On the one hand, they claimed an ungrateful Europe, symbolised by the hated “Brussels”, failed to appreciate Britain’s pivotal role in saving the continent in 1945 – and keeping it safe ever since. On the other hand, crafty Europeans were said to be undermining our sovereignty, exploiting our goodwill, and, as Margaret Thatcher put it, stealing “our money”.The more nuanced truth is very different. Most European states, most of the time, valued Britain’s presence at the EU’s top table. Given its strong democratic, parliamentary and public service traditions, attachment to the rule of law and commitment to free and fair trade, Britain was seen by many as a model, particularly in post-Soviet central and eastern Europe. Britain championed EU enlargement. It served as a bridge to the US. It was a key actor in Nato. And it provided crucial balance to the perpetually fragile Franco-German relationship.Not all of this will be lost when Britain departs on 29 March next year. Nor should we repeat the old error of exaggerating British influence. But make no mistake, the damage to the idea of Europe, and to Europe’s standing in the world, will be considerable and lasting. In the era of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, the European Enlightenment’s legacy of open societies based on legal rights, obligations and inidual freedoms is under sustained attack. Democratic governance is not a given in much of the world. Europe is its first and last bastion. And Britain just broke ranks.The position of Germany in post-Brexit Europe is of particular interest. Angela Merkel’s government believes, rightly, that Brexit is a big mistake. Germans generally appear to feel a sense of regret, mixed with unease. Berlin must now face the challenges presented by the European-wide rise of rightwing populism, Italy’s contagious anti-Brussels fiscal rebellion and the fraught problems posed by mass migration into unstable, indebted southern Europe without assistance from Britain, an instinctively like-minded ally.The ever-cautious Merkel will meanwhile be confronted more directly by the ambitious policy demands of France’s excitable president, Emmanuel Macron. In deep trouble at home after only 18 months in office, Macron is seeking salvation on a wider stage, casting himself as champion of progressive Europe. Macron advocates greater EU political, budgetary and defence integration. Many in Europe and in Berlin, where they suspect he wants Germany to foot the bill, oppose him. Britain would too, except it will have no say. In this ergence lie the seeds of a definitive fracture at the top of the EU.Germany could ultimately be forced to make a choice: either lead or leave. Overtly taking charge in Europe is something Berlin has hitherto assiduously avoided for painful historical reasons. It would alarm many member states. It would alarm many Germans, too. And would such a scenario suit Britain’s interests any more than those of France? An alternative, already mooted, is a north-south European split, in which Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and the Scandinavian and Baltic states could break away to form a sort of modern-day version of the Hanseatic League. If that point were reached, the very idea of a union of Europe would die.Hard Tory Brexiters would doubtless welcome such an outcome. So, too, would Russia, a serial disrupter of European democracy. Brexit, which he covertly assisted, has given great comfort to Putin. Further Kremlin efforts to exploit Europe’s isions can now be expected, most predictably in the Balkans. Trump, too, will relish the disarray in Europe’s camp. Without seasoned British diplomacy to help smooth paths and unruffle feathers, US-EU tensions on trade, tariffs, Nato, climate change, Iran and Israel-Palestine could, over time, morph into open confrontation.Pro-Leave analysts argue that all such talk is fanciful and that not much will really change for ordinary people. This, perhaps, is the biggest Brexit lie of all. Try telling that to citizens, British and European, when they face new barriers, regulatory and financial, to travel and holidays. Trying telling that to young entrepreneurs, doctors, nurses, carers, agricultural workers, students and academics seeking jobs or study in the UK (and vice versa). Try telling that to all those around the world who once esteemed Britain as a welcoming, erse, tolerant and integrated country of rights, freedoms, refuge and opportunity. The scale of Europe’s loss is exceeded only by our own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f3b8d0f9e82d7ad0cfbf4908f139d029addc754/0_0_4866_3057/master/4866.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5e0c9c41594805b48f45e853b4a88b30 1400w","title":"pine martens forest of dean return of a predator","story":"Rewilding plan could help other species such as the red squirrel back into the Forest of DeanAndrew Stringer from Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust gestures excitedly at a large hollow high up in the gnarled trunk of a 200-year-old oak tree in the Forest of Dean.“Pine martens would definitely den in there because they need nice insulated places, particularly in the spring to raise their young,” he says.Stringer is leading a project that could result in the Forest of Dean becoming the first place in England to reintroduce what was once the country’s second most common predator: the pine marten.“It’s really exciting that they could be coming back,” he says. “What could be more wonderful than restoring a species that has been lost?”If the trust can raise enough money, up to 60 pine martens could be released into the forest in September next year – mirroring a successful reintroduction in mid-Wales, where 51 martens were brought from northern Scotland between 2015 and 2017.The project, which is backed by the Forestry Commission and currently out for consultation, could see the area’s population of martens reach 200. Stringer hopes the 65-70cm long predators will create gaps in the forest’s ecosystem for rarer species, such as red squirrels and goldcrests, which are better adapted to avoiding martens. “They are going to eat what is most common, like grey squirrels and wood pigeons,” he says.In Ireland red squirrels are starting to establish themselves in counties where martens have eradicated greys, which are native to north America.Chris Sandom from the University of Sussex, who is contributing to a book on rewilding, has identified 24 other rewilding projects across the UK, including the reintroduction of beavers in Devon and white-tailed eagles in Scotland. “Rewilding is about nature taking the lead rather than managing nature,” he says. “It is an idea that is gaining momentum.”Stringer accepts rewilding is controversial for some landowners but he sees it as vital to making our ecosystems sustainable. “Predation is a classic natural process that is missing from our landscape. That is why species reintroduction is associated with rewilding,” he says.Dogwalkers enjoying the last hours of daylight are also excited by the prospect of pine martens returning to the Forest of Dean. Debra Clough, who lives in nearby Cinderford, says: “It’s a great idea. We’ve got to learn to live with all these things. We’ve rather taken over I think.”Even gamekeepers, whose Victorian predecessors hunted pine martens to extinction in much of the country to boost gamebird numbers, back the plan. “Our attitudes have changed,” says Tim Weston from the National Gamekeepers’ Organisation. “We canvassed local gamekeepers and they’re not opposed.”But Weston adds that pine martens repeatedly targeting gamebird pens or hens on small-holdings should be culled or relocated. “If you have one inidual continually raiding a chicken house there needs to be mitigating measures,” he says.The forest has already seen the return of another emblematic animal of the British countryside this year. A pair of beavers were introduced in July by the Forestry Commission as part of a trial to establish if the dam-building mammals are able to reduce the risk of flash flooding.However other recent wild arrivals in the forest are more isive. In the late 90s wild boar were illegally released and there are now an estimated 1,600 roaming free in the forest.As a freezing mist settles over the dark tree-covered hills, rare-pig farmer Richard Vaughan checks on a pair of his prized middle white sows with their litter of piglets. He fears they could pick up African swine fever, which is spreading through Europe, from wild boar. “You’ve only got to have a wild boar eating a half-eaten sandwich made with infected meat and we’ve got African swine flu in this country,” he says.Vaughan, who has shot 46 wild boar on his 500-acre farm so far this year, says environmentalists need to be careful about releasing wild animals. “It very easy to say ‘Oh we need wild boar, we need wolves, we need lynx, now I’m going back to my nice semi in Surbiton’ but I have to live with the consequences,” he says.Locals in nearby Lydbrook also complain about boars. John Jones, at the village’s garage, says he sees cars damaged by collisions with boar every week. “I don’t know much about pine martens. But wild boar cause a lot of problems here,” he says.Nicky England, who is serving drinkers at the Jovial Colliers Inn, is still keen on bringing back pine martens. “I think it’s a good idea especially if they are native to this area,” she says. “Although they are introducing a predator, it’s still good for wildlife – it’s the circle of life.”For Stringer there are no parallels between martens, which are preyed on by foxes, and wild boar. “It is not an example of a reintroduction going wrong – it was an illegal release. If a feasibility study had been done then you would have seen there are no predators for boars – no wolves in the ecosystem.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff0dacc71eebf8ac299ab2ad6dee88d07a726c13/853_301_1720_1720/master/1720.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4a42847d3d4bc62b6cd33fff087930fd 1400w","title":"nicolas roeg a life in pictures","story":"Film director and cinematographer Nic Roeg has died at the age of 90.

Here is a selection of recipes from Trine Hahnemann’s latest cookbook, Copenhagen FoodHotdogs are Copenhagen’s street food. It was the first and the only one for many years. We have a nickname for a hotdog stand: “Restaurant Cold Feet”.Growing up in the 1970s, having a hotdog was a treat. The sheer excitement of choosing between ketchup, mustard, rémoulade, or all together. Then the choice between raw or fried onions? And did you want it with or without pickled sliced cucumber? I always had fried onions, and the cucumbers were the absolute best for me. They made the hotdog perfect.I remember mostly having homemade hotdogs at special occasions, and often at birthday parties. We would buy thin sausages at the butcher and bake the buns ourselves. It was good for parties and perfect with beer, and also great for dinner. When I made them for my kids, I would always serve them with a red cabbage salad. It is still a combination that works for me.You can find hotdogs all over Copenhagen. There is even a stall in the arrivals section at the airport, to greet homesick Copenhageners.For the rolls:yeast 25g, fresh salted butter 50gwhole milk 300ml, lukewarmstrong white flour 500g, plus more to dustsugar 1 tbsp fine sea salt 1 tsp egg 1, lightly beatenFor the cucumber salad:apple cider vinegar 250mlwater 3½ tbsp caster sugar 125g sea salt a pinchcucumbers 2For the hotdogs:sausages 10, good-quality butcher’sonions 100g, fried (see below)onions 4 tbsp, raw choppedtomato ketchupsweet Scandinavian mustardrémoulade (see below)For the fried onions: Makes about 500g onions 750g, finely slicedplain flour 50g sea salt 1 tbsp, plus more to finishvegetable oil 500ml to 1 litre, flavourless, for deep fryingFor the rémoulade: carrot 1, finely slicedceleriac 120g, peeled and finely choppedsea saltcucumber ½, deseeded and cut into tiny dicemayonnaise 50mlred onion ½ tsp, finely gratedmedium curry powder 1 tsp English mustard powder ½ tsp lemon juice 1 tsp capers 2 tbsp, drained, rinsed and choppedFor the fried onions, place the sliced onions in a bowl with the flour and salt and mix very well until the onions are coated. Pour them into a sieve and shake, to get rid of any excess flour. Half-fill a deep frying pan with the vegetable oil and set over a medium heat. Make sure the oil is hot by placing a slice of onion in it: if it sizzles, it is ready. Reduce the heat a little and a third of the sliced onions. Careful, it may spit! Don’t leave the pan instead, stir occasionally with a slotted spoon. Fry until light brown and crispy. Using the slotted spoon, transfer the onions to a plate lined with kitchen paper and sprinkle with a little more salt. Repeat the process with the remaining 2 batches of onions.For the rémoulade, boil the carrot and celeriac in lightly salted water for 4-5 minutes. Drain and leave to cool, then mix with the cucumber in a bowl. In another bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, onion, curry and mustard powders, lemon juice and capers, then mix this into the carrot and celeriac mixture.For the rolls, crumble the yeast into the milk and stir to dissolve. Melt the butter and stir it into the milk. Now mix in the flour, sugar and salt, then knead well on a floured surface. Put the dough into a bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave it to rise at room temperature for 1–2 hours, or until doubled in size. After it has risen, form it into 10 fat oval buns and place on 2 baking sheets lined with baking parchment. Cover with tea towels and leave to rise for a further 20 minutes.Now for the cucumber salad. Whisk the vinegar, water, sugar and salt together in a non-reactive bowl. Slice the cucumber thinly, add to the vinegar mixture and leave to stand for at least 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Brush the rolls with the beaten egg and bake for 20-25 minutes. Leave to cool on a wire rack.For the hotdogs, fry the sausages in a dry frying pan for 5-10 minutes, depending on their size, until cooked through. Meanwhile, get all the condiments ready.Now everyone just has to assemble their own hotdog to their liking.Mussels are cheap and delicious, so we ought to eat them every week.mussels 1 kg olive oil 2 tbspbacon 50g, finely choppedonion 1, finely choppedpotatoes 100g, skins on, scrubbed and finely choppedgarlic 3 cloves, finely choppedtarragon 3-4 sprigs, plus a small handful of leaves to servewheat beer 300ml sea saltblack peppercrusty bread to serveRinse the mussels in cold water. Scrub them thoroughly and tug out any beards. Discard any broken mussels, or those that are open and refuse to close when tapped against the edge of the sink. Keep them in the fridge until you are ready to cook.Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the bacon and cook until crisp, then add the onion, potatoes, garlic and tarragon sprigs. Now tip in the mussels, pour in the beer and season with salt and pepper, remembering that the mussels are salty. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover and steam for a few minutes, shaking the pan from time to time, until all the mussels have opened. Discard the few that refuse to open. Serve sprinkled with the tarragon leaves and offer bread to soak up the delicious juices.This is my favourite chocolate bar. I really love the nutty taste of the marzipan. Makes about 12For the marzipan:blanched almonds 350gicing sugar 100g , plus more to dustwater 50mlFor the marzipan, whizz the blanched almonds in a food processor and keep whizzing until they become a paste. Add the icing sugar, whizz again, then add the water and whizz again. Knead the marzipan on a work surface dusted with icing sugar. Form it into a big brick-like shape and leave it to rest in the fridge for 2 hours or, preferably, overnight. Cut the marzipan into 12 rectangles while you temper the chocolate. For this you will need a sugar thermometer.Melt 140g of the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water make sure the bowl does not touch the water.When the chocolate has reached 50C, remove the pan from the heat and add the remaining 60g of chocolate. Mix well until melted. Gently heat in the same way as before until the chocolate reaches 31C . Now it is ready to use. Keep the chocolate’s temperature at a steady 31C while you are working with it.Finally, dip each bar in the tempered chocolate, making sure they are covered, then place on a wire rack until the chocolate has set.Copenhagen Food by Trine Hahnemann is published by Quadrille at £25.

Just as the best genre fiction or cinema has more fresh ideas and intellectual liveliness than the many laborious and flaccid examples of literary fiction and arty independent film, so there are many winemakers working under the humble Côte du Rhône or Villages label whose output is far more interesting than lesser talents working in starry appellations. I would exchange any number of undistinguished Châteauneuf-du-Papes trading on the appellation name by adding an unjustified tenner to their price-tag, for a beautifully judged generic Côtes du Rhône from a talented winemaker – such as posh wine merchant Berry Bros \u0026amp Rudd’s Côte du Rhône Rouge. Made by the brilliant Rémi Pouzin from Domaine Dieu-Le-Fit in Visan with an almost racy crunchy blackberry freshness and savoury tinge, there’s nothing generic about it.St-Cosme Côtes du Rhône, France 2017 (£14.99, Handfords VINVM) There are plenty of other Rhône stars who use the Côtes du Rhône appellation for something more serious than the basic everyday. The truly legendary Châteauneuf-du-Pape producer Château Rayas is responsible for perhaps the finest Côtes du Rhône of them all. At around £100 a bottle (the Harrogate Fine Wine Company has the extraordinary 2009 vintage for £105 Harrogate Fine Wine), Château de Fonsalette Côtes du Rhône Réserve is nobody’s idea of a bargain but it is a uniquely beautiful red wine, with a silky harmony of texture, and wisps of wild woody herb, sun-warmed earthiness, baking spices and a shake of the pepper pot. At a rather more humane price, another great Rhône winemaker, St-Cosme’s Louis Barruol, who makes wonderfully deep but fragrant wines in Gigondas, has a very fine all-syrah Côtes du Rhône that is sinewy and savoury with brambly fruit, blood and herbs: a perfect winter-warmer.Follow David on Twitter @Daveydaibach This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The manager tasted defeat for the first time in the Premier League and the only comfort to him may have been that the scoreline flattered his team.“I hope first of all for the players because I told them in the last week that we had a big problem with our approach to the start of matches and today was the same approach. The level of build-up was different and, after 15 minutes, we were 2-0 down.”Mauricio Pochettino, the Spurs manager, could be delighted with every aspect of the game – apart from, possibly, a bit of wasteful finishing – but he chose to highlight the attitude of his players which, he said, had not always been on point this season.“Today confirms that it’s not about the names on the pitch – it’s about the right attitude,” Pochettino said. “One thing we need to realise is that with the right attitude, we can compete at this level. The problem is when we struggle to show our real quality because we show a lack of aggressivity, will and attitude.”“In the first 25 or 30 minutes, we had big problems to exit from our half. We lost a lot of balls and, against Tottenham, it is very dangerous to lose a lot of balls in your half. In the short counter-attack, they are probably the best in Europe.”Eden Hazard was denied a penalty on 14 minutes, after a challenge from Juan Foyth, which might have levelled it up at 1-1 but Sarri refused to look for excuses.“I don’t think it would have made a difference because for 90 minutes, there was a difference,” Sarri said. “I have to study the 90 minutes, not only one action. It looked like a penalty but I have to say Tottenham won well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de8de8969906b16251e32eb9011c49f6b3eefc3e/299_182_3022_1813/master/3022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f74845e9f10c7cd5f0302ae01c60fd4","title":"river plate boca juniors copa libertadores final second leg","story":"The second leg of the Copa Libertadores final between River Plate and Boca Juniors had to be postponed for 24 hours on Saturday as a result of an attack on the Boca team bus. River fans clashed with police outside the stadium as tear gas and rubber bullets were fired. But the violence is only part of the story.There were desperate attempts to stage the game on its scheduled day, first with an hour’s delay, at 6pm local time, and then at 7.15, 7.30 and 7.45, before the abandonment was finally announced to deafening whistles from the 70,000 inside the ground at around 7.20. A large part of the fallout will concern who applied pressure to whom and what machinations occurred in the three and a quarter hours after the attack.The mood had seemed excited and expectant as River fans descended on the Stadio Monumental, while Boca fans, thanks to the ban on away fans in Argentina, made for their home ground, La Bombonera, eight miles away, to watch on a giant screen.But when the police escort, surprisingly according to locals, led the Boca bus on to Avenida Monroe a little after 4pm, it was surrounded by River fans who pelted it with missiles. Video subsequently released by the club showed at least five smashed windows.A video taken on a phone inside the bus shows Boca players chanting only to fall abruptly silent as the first missile strikes. As an official holds a curtain over the broken glass, the Boca midfielder Pablo Pérez turns away and slumps, clutching his face.Tear gas then entered the bus, although it is not clear whether that was from police seeking to disperse the crowds or from River fans targeting Boca players, as their players were targeted at La Bombonera in the Libertadores three years ago. On that occasion, River were awarded the game. Forensics experts were seen swabbing the bus, presumably to determine the origin of the gas.“There are many players who were coughing, with the feeling of needing to vomit,” said Carlos Tevez. “As for me, I had a lot of pain in my throat and just now it was giving me a headache.”The bus driver revealed he fainted and the bus would have crashed had a Boca vice-president, Horacio Paolini, not grabbed the wheel.Trouble continued with thousands of River fans breaking through security, so many without tickets were able to force their way into the stadium.Pérez was taken to hospital with an eye injury but the medical team of Conmebol, the South American federation, released a statement saying neither he nor any Boca player was unfit to play. Pérez was then named in the starting lineup. Boca, though, clearly did not wish to play. Tevez said they were being “obliged” to do so despite “being in no condition” while the midfielder Fernando Gago blamed the presidents of Conmebol and Fifa.It may also be that the president of Argentina, Mauricio Macri, a former president of Boca, had reasons to get the game played: he will host the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, starting on Thursday.The Boca president, Daniel Angelici, said: “We’ve had stones thrown at us before ... I always say matches are won and lost on the pitch, but we were not in the right condition to play today.” He thanked River for supporting Boca in their desire to postpone the game.As time drifted by and delay added to delay, it came to seem increasingly that the match, billed as the derby to end all derbies, would never start. When the announcement finally came, after the initial jeers and whistles, those in the stadium filed away relatively calmly, although there were some scuffles. The damage, though, to the spectacle and to the reputation of Argentinian football had already been done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cec61b7496f2b6e115afafe2f1b62ec04780a76/0_2211_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=957d528a365c51eee0741d56fedc84b3","title":"futurists the world in 2050 science medicine food travel predictions","story":"From family holidays in space to robot doctors and an end to work… Four experts predict what life will be like 30 years from nowEarlier this year, the theoretical physicist Michio Kaku published a book, The Future of Humanity, in which he grappled with a question central to most of our lives: what will our future look like? Kaku is a popular scientist. He has a knack for studying today’s trends in order to hypothesise what might come tomorrow – how we’ll live, where we’ll live, whether or not an almighty AI might soon rule over us. And he’s not the only one. Futurists have been conceptualising our potential fate for centuries, sometimes successfully. Perhaps, as we stumble through uncertain times, their work is more important now than ever. So what will the world look like in 2050? We asked Kaku and three other futurists to share their predictions.A theoretical physicist and futurist, Kaku is the author of several books of popular science, including the New York Times bestseller, The Future of the Mind: The Scientific Quest to Understand, Enhance, and Empower the Mind.By 2050 we’ll be able to send memories, emotions and feelings across the internet. Brain science will have exploded, and it will have revolutionised communication. Teenagers will love it. Instead of putting an emoticon at the end of every sentence, they’ll use an emotion: anger, happiness, excitement. This will replace entertainment movies will become obsolete. I’m talking about telepathy, really. We’ll still communicate the old-fashioned way, but communicating telepathically will reduce the obstacles between people. Our grandchildren will wonder, What is a keyboard? We will enter the age of the “brain net”.Medicine will develop exponentially, too. We will have cured certain forms of cancer, and we will have begun to treat the disease like the common cold. We’ll live with it. It will no longer be lethal. We won’t fear it like we used to. Technology will help in this respect. Smart toilets will perform liquid biopsies – which are already available – to detect cancer cells, genes and enzymes. We’ll catch tumours years or even decades before they form, when they’re just small colonies of several hundred cells circulating in the blood. Smart objects will measure our biometrics automatically. The iPhone can already calculate a pulse. In the future, our clothes will detect the beginnings of a heart attack, and advise us to seek treatment immediately.This results, naturally, in longevity. I don’t think we’ll be immortal by 2050, but we’ll be setting the foundations for immortality. We’re gradually discovering the genes that control the ageing process, and we’ll soon understand how to repair the biological damage inflicted on our bodies over the course of our lives. In this way, medicine will move past simply providing a cure, and will help move humanity closer to biological perfection. We will become gods. We’ll have the immortal body of Venus. The speed of Mercury. The power of the mind of Zeus.But what use is longevity without eternal youth? That’s where the idea of a human body shop comes in. We’ll grow organs to replace those that wear out. We can already use human cells to grow skin, cartilage, noses, ears, heart valves, bladders… In the future? We’ll grow the liver, the kidney, perhaps the pancreas. By 2050 I suspect we’ll be able to grow many of the vital organs of the body and, rather than allow the organs we’re born with to become old and decrepit, we’ll replace them. That’s all coming. And it doesn’t take much imagination to realise it.Astrophysicist and author deGrasse Tyson is the Frederick P Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York. His latest book is Accessory to War: The Unspoken Alliance Between Astrophysics and the Military.If you were to create a settlement on an another planet, here’s the problem. In the old days, when settlers landed in some new place, they could breathe the air. They could repair their ships with wood from trees. Fruit grew on plants. Basic life support existed. But it won’t for the new generation of settlers. You cannot breathe on Mars, so you will need to seed the soil, generate oxygen – terraform it. That’s not an inconceivable future path for us, but it is a level of geo-engineering we’ve yet to master. When you’ve terraformed a planet, OK, we can talk about moving there. But until that happens we’d be living in a habitat that’s simulating Earth. And what’s the point in doing that? Antarctica is balmier and wetter than Mars, and you don’t see developers clambering to build condos in Antarctica.By 2050, I can imagine Mars becoming a vacation site. Instead of going to the beach, people will spend money to go and hang out in space. I’d do that! But that’s a business model that has yet to be set up. There’s no infrastructure. No way to make food or fuel. How would people get back to home-base Earth?If humanity wanted to – if we had the motivation – we might be able to turn at least the near solar system into our backyard. It will be difficult. Elon Musk famously said: “How do you build a small fortune in space? Start with a big fortune.” But if we were to manage it, we’d have access to what are essentially unlimited resources. Asteroids are rich in various metallic and mineral ingredients – rare Earth elements – that are fundamental to modern civilisation: gold, silver, platinum, iridium, cadmium, osmium. Comets have unlimited supplies of water. The world’s first trillionaire will be the first person to exploit these resources. Imagine having the capacity to distribute those resources where they are most needed around the world? Something like a third of conflicts are based on the limited access to resources. If, by 2050, we had unlimited global access, would those wars still exist?This all points to the growing importance of space, particularly for commerce. The future value of space assets won’t be measured by the amount of hardware that’s orbiting the Earth, but by the amount of commerce that hardware enables. Think about Uber. Its entire business model is founded on the existence of GPS satellites. Or Tinder. Want to date someone nearby? You’re relying on GPS. Satellites generate hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce. That’s a kind of power governments might call it “soft power”. So by 2050 space will have become a hotly contested zone.If there is conflict in the future, a nation’s best move might be to take out its enemy’s space assets, bringing down its economy. But would you use space to wage war on Earth, rather than to mine its resources and grow the world economy? Wherever you have a healthy economy, people tend to live longer and be happier. For 2050, that’s a noble goal.A best-selling author and futurist, Popcorn is also the founder and CEO of BrainReserve, a future-focussed strategic consultancy established in 1974.Human doctors have a problem: they’re human. They make mistakes. They don’t show up. They get sick. So algorithms will replace them, providing patients with the function of a doctor 247. Artificial intelligence will inform us very early on in our lives what we are allergic to, what our sensitivities are, how much exercise we require, what our stress levels are.We’re already finding that AI psychologists are extremely effective. They’re able to measure a patient’s responses to questions. They understand which questions provoke stress. They measure a patient’s biometrics during sessions. Human therapists can’t do that. They can’t take all that information in.This might all have happened by 2030, let alone 2050. By that point, science fiction will have become just science. Everything will be implanted: the ability to dispense medicine (the “robo-release”), the ability to predict cancer, the ability to measure the function of our heart or lungs. Tiny chips will be implanted within our bodies at birth, around the same moment you cut the umbilical cord. We will store our medical records in our fingertips.We won’t be having babies naturally by that point. Pregnancy will have become outdated. People will grow babies in labs, or their living rooms, in what look like fish tanks. And gender will have become irrelevant.Race will become obsolete, too. I predicted in 1988 that everybody will be brown, eventually. But what won’t become obsolete, and what could become problematic, is intelligence: how smart you can become through the AI you can buy, how many drugs you can afford to micro-dose throughout the day, to make you sharper and more able.There will be many people who don’t have the money to access new kinds of medical enhancement. There will be the people with, and the people without – unless a social class develops that decides to save those without. That could happen. Hopefully.A global security futurist and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, Washington DC, Zalman is the founder of the Strategic Narrative Institute, a futurist consultancy. Between 2014 and 2016 she was the CEO of the World Future Society.There’s a lovely phrase, attributed to the futurist Roy Amara, that goes like this: “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.” With this in mind, let’s consider work. We’re already discussing what kinds of jobs will be affected by automation. We know that some of the losers will be those with white-collar qualifications whose work is relatively routine: accountants, much of the work of lawyers, some of the work of journalists. But by 2050 we’ll begin to see paradigmatic changes. We have all these assumptions about how work and the world is shifting. But the changes occurring now are too incipient for us to get our heads around. It’s not that automation will change work. It’s that work will change so drastically that we’ll need to give what we do an entirely different name.The winners will be those people in jobs we don’t even know about yet, at the intersection of technology and other fields. Data and criminal justice. Data and homewares. Data and medical services. Data and biotechnology. It will be an exciting time for philosophers and ethicists. We’ll quickly realise the need to understand how we treat, use, manage and live with artificial intelligence. We’ll need philosophers and ethicists to legislate ourselves into the future.If there is a significant displacement from automation, we’ll require a tweak in the social services system. We’ll send people back to school. We’ll find new ways for people to make money. There will be experiments in the universal basic income. Eventually, we’ll create new forms of work. We’re kind of an ingenious race that way.But the one thing that seems unlikely to change in the next 30 years is wealth inequality. This will reverberate across generations. Some of us will continue to become really rich some of us will continue to become very poor. Inequality won’t rise from automation alone. It will continue to develop from the kind of economic reward system we’ve already established: that money makes money. That will lead to a biological ide in society, too. There will be a class of people able to enhance not only their education, as people have been able to do for decades – you go to a private school, you get a better education – but their own bodies, through other kinds of augmentation.

I know he’s happy and healthy.”Nishi is six, and was diagnosed with a dairy allergy as a baby. Reena was already vegetarian, and had felt uneasy about eating animal products for some time. Because her baby son was now more or less vegan by default, she joined him – and today the pair are strictly plant-based. Her older son, Aarush, is eight, and, like his dad, vegetarian but considering veganism. (Both boys are currently obsessed with creating an online vegan sweetshop.)For many parents, the idea of raising children on nothing but plants is hard to fathom. Anyone who has ever struggled to make a child eat something as inoffensive as peas will probably balk at barring fish fingers (protein) and yoghurt (calcium). But the number of vegan children is on the rise in the UK. No one knows exactly how many there are the Vegan Society’s most recent figures state that there are about 600,000 vegans in the country, twice the number there were two years ago – but this figure accounts only for people aged over 15. It’s a social shift driven by health, environmental and animal welfare concerns, as well as high-profile campaigns such as Veganuary, which saw nearly 168,500 people around the world give up meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey for four weeks last January. Since nearly half of all British vegans are aged 15-34, the Vegan Society assumes the number of vegan children must also be increasing sharply. How do their families do it?Tamar Nussbacher-Lawrence’s rather choosy three-year-old son hasn’t put her, or her husband Rob, off their newly adopted veganism. “He only wants to eat toast, rice, pasta, chips and fruit,” she says. “I do worry about it, but I try not to be a crazy food pusher – I always make sure I offer him what we have. Maybe he will eat when he’s 18,” she smiles. The couple, who run Inkwa Tattoo studio in London (Tamar is also a reflexologist), have been vegan for 18 months, partly inspired by Rob’s Rastafarianism (it’s up to the inidual, but many Rastafarians adopt an “ital” diet and don’t eat animal products). After giving up red meat for a trial period, they quickly cut out chicken, fish and dairy, and then all animal products. “We just felt better, physically and mentally. And the better we felt, the easier it was to do,” says Rob.Another powerful motivator was that, soon after, Tamar became pregnant. “We had a hard journey towards having kids,” she says. “I’m not saying, ‘Go vegan and you’ll get pregnant.’ But I specialise in fertility and maternity reflexology, and I tell my clients that, even if you improve the quality of the meat you buy and eat less of it, it will make a difference to your system.”Tamar has two stepchildren who eat meat outside the home, but not when staying over, and an eight-month-old daughter who they are weaning as a vegan. “It started when I bought some meat for my son and the next morning it was still in date but completely brown. It made me think, what am I putting down his throat?”The change startled the couple’s friends and family. “We really liked meat, and we ate and cooked a lot of it – a lot of barbecues,” says Tamar. “A few people said, ‘You’ll be back in a week’, because every meal I had, it had to have meat,” adds Rob. “My dad used to run a pop-up Jamaican restaurant in the 1990s: jerk chicken, stew pork, curry goat – every kind of animal you can think of, from cow’s foot to pig’s trotter to oxtail. So when I snapped out of that, it shocked a lot of people.”His older boys are 13 and nine, and for them there was a period of adjustment. “My kids said, ‘Can I still eat meat?’ And they can,” says Rob. “But they know there are no meat products in our house. None to come in, none to go in our microwave, or our oven or our fridge. When they step out, they can make their own choices. I don’t want them to feel shackled by my decision. I can only try and guide them through what I think is right.”“We try to make things for them that aren’t too adventurous, like spaghetti bolognese, fajitas,” says Tamar. “And curries, rice, stew peas, all the things they’re used to, but with the meat taken out,” adds Rob. “With a lot of Caribbean food, you can just extract the meat and use other ingredients. ”They have explained their choice to their boys, including the three-year-old. “I tell him we don’t eat animals, and that animals are our friends. I don’t think he’s old enough to understand on any other level. Or care, to be honest,” says Tamar.As for their eight-month-old daughter, the couple are following a baby-led weaning approach, meaning they simply give her a bit of the vegan food they are eating. “She’s still breastfed, and until she’s one, she’ll get most of her nutrition from that,” says Tamar. “I make sure she has things like almond butter, tahini and avocado. I’m doing research and getting ideas about what to feed her. With my three-year-old, we weren’t vegan, and I did all the pureeing and freezing. I’m finding this easier. I just give her a bit of toast with peanut butter and she’s happy.”Erin Marrs lives in Kirkcaldy with her husband Paul, a professional hockey player, and their two sons, Oliver, who is five, and Charles, who is 18 months old. All four are vegan the children have been “vegan since conception”, says Erin. She converted her husband, having initially given up dairy to treat her adult acne. “He was not at all eager,” she says, “but what I tell everyone to do is pick a favourite meal and then veganise that. I learned to cook because there needed to be no reason he could say, ‘I’m missing out on something.’”The more Marrs learned about animal welfare, the more it underlined her choice. “I considered myself an animal lover, but I began to learn about factory farms, about how our consumption of animals has gone crazy. Once you see it, you can’t unlearn it. Watching the documentary Forks Over Knives was very powerful, and then Earthlings, which is horrible.” Would she consider herself an activist? “I’m more of a pacifist vegan. People ask if it’s for health or for animals, and I say both.”Although both sets of grandparents are very supportive, Marrs has had some difficult conversations with friends. “I’ve definitely had some judgment. I have one girlfriend who thinks it’s too extreme. She thinks I’m not indulging enough, when I have only one life to live – like it’s a massive diet that I’m on. She will ask, ‘When is this vegan thing going to be over?’ but I just laugh it off. That kind of judgment often comes from the people who are most interested or conflicted themselves.”Marrs’ Instagram feed is full of tempting bowls of multicoloured raw vegetables and falafel, or soups bursting with carrots and greens – all of it being grabbed by tiny, pudgy toddler hands. She wrangles a series of what sound like minor miracles every day. “In the morning, they usually go for fruit, first. We make a smoothie bowl or have overnight oats. We often do leftovers for lunch, or a wrap with hummus and veggies, or a chickpea salad sandwich. And then some sort of big dinner, like a big buddha bowl with a brown rice base, tons of veggies and a sauce.”It hasn’t always been straightforward. “My eldest went through a phase where he was very picky, around two or three. If you’re feeding them a vegan diet and they’re not eating any vegetables, you panic. He would only eat fruit – an entire pineapple, or bananas all day.” Marrs worried less than she might have done, as, in common with many vegan mothers, she extended breastfeeding until Oliver was three – partly to avoid having to find a suitable alternative drink. He stopped when Marrs became pregnant again.So far, Oliver has never veered off the vegan path. “If someone gives him peanut butter on toast, he’ll ask if the bread is vegan. He’s very vocal about it and very firm in his stance. I don’t think I’ve pushed it on to him, other than explaining to him why we eat this way.“Once he was old enough to know that people ate different things, he started to ask what they were eating and we told him: that’s a cow or a chicken. If we pass the meat counter in the supermarket, he’ll say, ‘That’s a dead chicken.’ He’s been around my family for turkey dinners. He knows it was once a living animal, and he has no interest in eating one.” At another child’s birthday party, he didn’t seem to mind not eating the cake. “I just said, it’s not vegan, and he said, OK. There was a trampoline, so he couldn’t have cared less about sitting down to eat.”It’s important to Marrs that her children do get treats. “People have suggested that when he turns 16 he’s just going to go to McDonald’s and gorge. But he won’t if he doesn’t feel like he’s missing out. If he wants a vegan doughnut, we go get one.” Like Patel, Marrs receives occasional comments about her eldest’s size. “My youngest is massive, but my older son is an average height, and some people ask if he’s a little bit small. I don’t know if they think that, because he’s vegan, he’s not going to grow big and strong.”“We explained from an early age why we were vegan,” she says. “When Emily was about 10, old enough not to be upset by it, we took her to see Vegucated at a community screening.” The 2011 documentary follows three New Yorkers who go vegan while learning about intensive animal farming. “The film explains why people might be vegan in a nice, positive way, but does go into some details,” Liddle says. “While they don’t show a lot, they do show some aspects of the meat industry, like the separation of parts of animals. I remember it was so sterile – turning animals into products, picking off the legs and dealing with the corpses. It was strange and macabre.”Although on occasion, Emily has rebelled – “we find the occasional wrapper of something containing dairy, but it’s no big deal” – she has avoided non-vegan food since she was very small. “At nursery, if she was offered a sweet that wasn’t vegan, she just wouldn’t have it.”The family’s choice is motivated by a number of factors. “For me, it’s about doing the right thing. Being vegan is an important part of intersectionalism. As well as animals, health and the environment, I care about humans. If we stop being violent towards animals, maybe we will understand how to make ourselves less violent towards people.” She says she was also affected by the experience of dairy cows. “The calf is separated from the mother almost immediately. That mother doesn’t have any rights.”Today, Emily attends secondary school in the Scottish Borders, where Liddle has met with the catering staff. “We explained how, if you change just one ingredient, instead of being vegetarian it will be vegan – but everyone can still have it. Things like not putting milk in soup, or doing lentil curry instead of chicken. There are lots of other options for non-vegan kids on any given day. It just needs a tiny tweak.”For Reena Patel, her children’s school in London has been the least complicated factor in her son’s veganism. “A couple of his friends are also vegan, so he’s not the odd one out.” At home, the family all eat the same food, with small adaptations to make a meal half-vegan and half-vegetarian. “So if we’re making pizza, half will be made with non-dairy cheese.”Until he was three, Nishi was untroubled about not being able to eat at other people’s houses. “But as he’s gone to more playdates and birthday parties, he’s felt quite left out. I have to send a list of things that he can’t eat and I offer to bring food for him, but mostly people are really accommodating. I’m always so grateful – it’s not something that I expect at all.”Because of Nishi’s allergies, the family were offered support from consultants and dietitians. “I was expecting a fight, going in saying: ‘He has all these allergies and we’re vegetarian, so he’s now vegan.’ On the whole, they’ve been brilliant. Just once, a dietitian likened it to child abuse: she said ‘He has so many allergies and he’s quite small, so it’s a form of neglect.’ I had to get up and walk out. I later found out she’d been asked to leave because she was so aggressive and judgmental.”Recently, Patel discovered she was more concerned about her youngest son’s size than the professionals. “I worried he was too small, but his allergy specialist sat me down and said, ‘Stop worrying, you’re petite and the chances are he’s just naturally small. He eats well – he’s absolutely fine.’ It was hugely reassuring.”“As a parent, veganism has to be a well-informed choice. But it’s absurd we feel the need to question parents who are vegan when I see so many kids on the way home from school eating chips, sweets and fizzy drinks. People are more antsy about veganism than junk food.”Anyone raising a vegan child in the UK who wants support should get it from their GP, and if necessary, a dietitian, says Rosie Saunt, a registered NHS dietitian and co-founder of the Rooted Project, which tries to counter nutritional myths in the media. “A GP will check that a parent or  is covering the bases. But then if they are still struggling they would be referred to a dietitian, particularly if there are any red flags, like their child isn’t thriving or growing as they should be.” She has no qualms about young children being vegan as long as parents focus on “lots of variety and give it some careful thought”. In 2017, the British Dietetic Association, Britain’s professional body for dietitians, reaffirmed its 2014 agreement with the Vegan Society, stating that a well-planned vegan diet can be healthy for people of any age.“General studies of vegan diets show they are definitely healthy,” says Saunt. “There are multiple health benefits, such as lowered risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It’s difficult to find studies to back up whether they are good for general health in children, infants and adolescents. This is for a few reasons: studies on children haven’t necessarily been done, as ethically it can be difficult, and the existing data on adults can be skewed by confounding factors. Adults who follow a vegan diet tend to be of higher socioeconomic status, they tend to exercise more, and not to smoke. So it’s hard to unpick if it’s the vegan diet alone leading to these benefits in adults.”Because the vegan diet is relatively restricted, in comparison with most UK diets (the average Briton is thought to eat nearly 80 kilos of meat a year and drink 82 litres of milk), vegan adults and children need to make sure they are getting enough of certain critical nutrients. “Calcium, iron, protein, vitamin D, B12, iodine and omega 3 fatty acids” are the important ones, says Saunt. “We are lucky in the UK, as there are loads of options in the supermarkets, so it is possible for children and infants to get all the nutrition they need from a plant-based diet.”She emphasises that it’s important for children to eat a wide range of vegan foods, including nuts, seeds, beans, pulses and soya products such as tofu. “Different foods contain nutrients which all work together in a complex synergy. Since energy and nutrient requirements are higher during growth, infants and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to deficiencies. They need enough energy to grow and be active, to ensure they remain healthy, fight infection, and learn.”Some health professionals have sounded a much more cautious note. Last year Mary Fewtrell, professor of paediatric nutrition at University College London, released a strongly worded statement voicing concern that parents of vegan infants were not following advice when it came to supplements, especially of vitamin B12. As chair of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition committee, Fewtrell wrote, “It is difficult to ensure a healthy and balanced vegan diet in young infants, and parents should understand the serious consequences of failing to follow advice regarding supplementation of the diet. The risks of getting it wrong can include irreversible cognitive damage and, in the extreme, death. Our advice is that if parents pursue a vegan diet for their child, they must seek and strictly follow medical and dietary advice.” (The Vegan Society responded at the time, stating, “Nutrient deficiencies are not an exclusively vegan problem and it is unfair to paint them as such.”)Jones has two vegan siblings. “Sixteen years ago my brother, who is now in his late 20s, went vegan – if he went out, all he could eat was bean burgers from Nando’s, on repeat. My mum and dad found it very difficult, as it was so rare. But us kids have had an upwards effect on my parents. Over the years we’ve informed them and given them books, and let them know that we are going to be OK. My mum is now almost completely vegan and my dad eats steak about once a year.” Raising a vegan child is perhaps trickiest in families where no one else is even vegetarian. Jen Stanbrook, an interiors blogger based in Nottingham, has two daughters. The eldest, 14, is a strict vegan on moral and ethical grounds she doesn’t wear wool or leather and uses only cruelty-free skincare brands. “I don’t ever cook a family meal now,” Stanbrook says. “When Ella was vegetarian it was easier to add the meat or extra ingredients, but the vegan diet makes this pretty impossible. We sit down together but mostly I cook at least two, if not three, different meals. My younger daughter won’t eat anything labelled vegan, although Ella batch cooks about three quarters of her own meals now.”Some friends, colleagues and family members fail to understand why Stanbrook is so accommodating. “The initial reaction is the usual: surely that can’t be healthy, how does she get enough protein? Other people, parents usually, just say we should force her to eat meat, that she’s too young to make that kind of decision and they would never allow it in their house. But she’s passionate about her way of life. And I’m sure she has a much better, more balanced diet than a lot of her peers.”She admits she found Ella’s veganism hard at first. “It took a lot of effort from us all to make it work. I do feel sad that our family meals out are more restricted, but I am proud of Ella. She is very knowledgeable about food and nutrition. She follows her principles and wants to make a difference. It’s inspiring.”Mac and ’shews “Cheese” made with vegetables and raw cashew nuts, pureed, then baked.

Plant-based sources include wholewheat and rye, but aren’t likely to provide enough. It is found in seaweed, but the amount of iodine varies hugely in sea vegetables. It is recommended that vegans consider an iodine supplement.Vitamin B12 Children may show signs of B12 deficiency more rapidly than adults. Symptoms include low energy or appetite, or failure to thrive long-term it can lead to more permanent damage. The Vegan Society recommends that children aged one to five have a supplement or get it from fortified foods, because it is found almost exclusively in animal products. Other good sources are nutritional yeast, some dairy-free spreads and yeast extract.Omega 3 fats These are important for heart health and brain development. They are found in plants as well as animal sources, but the plant source provides a type of fatty acid which the body has to convert very slowly into the one we need. You can find it in rapeseed oil, flax seeds, hemp, chia and walnuts. There is a supplement containing the form we need, made from micro-algae but as yet, there’s not enough research about whether these supplements work.Vitamin D It is recommended that everyone in the UK takes a vitamin D supplement in winter months, whether vegan or not, because of the lack of sun. But Vitamin D3 is often made from sheep’s wool, and so isn’t vegan. You can get a version made from lichen, or choose vitamin D2.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3557e125ba3e772f7c63aa4adb245ac97945302b/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01b2790b34fb571bbe1a2b3abf6a2d06","title":"quiz what kind of a sharer are you","story":"From crisps to feelings, sharing feels good.

Could the answer be to put ourselves out there more? We challenged standup Tessa Coates to find outWhen asked if I’d take on a week of challenges designed to help me open up my life to others, I saw “throw a dinner party” on the list of activities and said yes without reading the fine print. That, friends, is how I found myself running with a gang of overly enthusiastic joggers to an allotment on a dark Monday night, weeding a vegetable patch, and then running back.I wanted to learn something about myself during my week of sharing challenges. Reader, I learned that, while I am too often a cynical husk of a woman, I can be rehabilitated. And if I can, you can.Challenge one was at the Castle Canteen at the Crossway Christian Centre in Elephant and Castle, where volunteers make a free lunch once a week for anyone who wants it, from donated surplus food. Unquestionably a wonderful project, I was absolutely dreading it my catering experience starts and ends at being told off for eating the canapés and being sent home for backchat, while my volunteering experience starts and ends at being told off for not listening during the safety talk – and then being sent home for backchat. I had a heavy heart.To my delight, the Castle Canteen is run by a brilliant lady named Emily, who’s a professional chef. Nobody sent me home and everyone said I did a good job chopping the mange tout. When our lunch guests started to file in, my unsociable side wanted to stay at my chopping board. If I wasn’t there as part of a challenge, I might well have. But I forced myself to go out and find a seat, wondering how to find common ground.“Hello lovely lady, you’re new, what’s your name?” was the immediate greeting. A fantastic woman called Stella had me laughing in minutes, introducing me to a teacher, a musician and an ex-jockey. Conversation flowed, everybody had a story. It pulled at my heartstrings to see people light up with someone to talk to.That evening, I met a group of 30, all running with the social fitness group GoodGym, to help out with a gardening project. You meet for a run, do half an hour’s work, and then run back. The cynic in me was wearing away, fast. Who was I to make sassy comments when there are people out there trying to do something genuinely good?Next, I put a note under my neighbours’ door asking if they’d like to come round for some wine. Not the ones downstairs – we’d had an altercation over a plant pot 18 months ago and no one’s gotten over it – but the ones above. I explained the challenge, which made things less awkward, and next minute they were all round, new baby in tow. Suddenly we’re all laughing at the kitchen table, as if we lived in some kind of Mediterranean utopia.The dinner party, to which I was supposed to invite people from different parts of my life, made me very anxious. I rarely mix friends because I am not a natural hostess, and get so nervous that people won’t have a nice time that I inevitably ensure they don’t. But I swallowed down my whirlwind of nerves, invited friends who’d never met each other, gave them a glass of wine, and listened to them talking while I tried not to burn myself in the kitchen. “Why have we never met before?” they kept shouting at me. Honestly, I don’t know.I’ve realised that it’s easier to roll your eyes at the back than it is to get involved, but not nearly as fun. If we dig deeper, there’s probably something in there about fearing rejection. Regardless, I’m officially taking off my big cynical hat.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides. Don’t stick a skewer in, but check the sponge’s doneness by pressing lightly with a finger. It should bounce back at you. If you leave a ot, give it another 5 minutes.

Your support is critical for the long-term sustainability of the .Being supported by readers means that we must focus on the stories that are most meaningful to society: serious reporting that takes time and effort, carefully uncovers the facts, holds the powerful to account, and interrogates ideas and arguments – journalism that speaks to the urgency of the moment, but lasts for more than a day.In the last few years we have experienced a dramatic undermining of the business model for serious journalism, as well as a series of political and social shocks, from the EU referendum result to the election of Donald Trump, and what many believe is an unprecedented level of disruption to our planet, our nation states, our communities, ourselves.The support of our readers has enabled us to pursue quality, investigative journalism which has resulted in huge global scoops such as the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook scandal – uncovered by Carole Cadwalladr, who writes for our sister paper the Observer – and about the use of people’s data in political campaigns. In addition, the Windrush revelations gave a voice to the Commonwealth citizens who have been in the UK for decades but subjected to terrible indignities because they had no paperwork.We have also continued to build on the ’s proud tradition of progressive journalism by increasing our focus on the environment, committing to reporting on inequality, exposing offshore tax avoidance through both the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers, and investigating the behaviour and employment practices of corporations in a globalised world.We believe, through the support of our readers, that we have a profound opportunity to connect with each other and experience – first hand – the stories that are shaping all of our lives, and to collaborate as we work towards a better, more informed future.At the , we are committed to holding the powerful to account and covering stories that would otherwise be ignored, and, we hope, helping to build a fairer world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8531f8a493f3b1a38ac8153db248f690532b30d9/664_424_5312_3187/master/5312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58253ce24727dc5af1ed10e41a146b8b","title":"today in focus guardian daily podcast new host","story":"The host of the ’s new daily podcast and her team aim to inject originality and heart into the news agendaI was on maternity leave when I decided to leave my role as joint political editor to present Today in Focus – the ’s new daily podcast. I was gutted to stop working alongside my amazing job-share, Heather Stewart, but excited to find myself back at our headquarters in King’s Cross.The new team was placed on a bank of desks on the second floor, close to the Observer newsroom, where colleagues I’d worked with for eight years before leaving for the parliamentary lobby in 2009 are still beavering away. On our other side are (usefully!) the lawyers and the sports desk, followed by global development writers, and a strengthened environment team.Then – just two minutes around the corner – is the newsdesk, where the volume rises as editors gather around desks to make quick, collective decisions on rolling stories.Given our aim is to showcase  and Observer journalism by telling its stories in a fresh and engaging way, sitting in the middle of two newsrooms feels like the perfect location. Meanwhile, we can turn to the reporting teams in the US and Australia, foreign correspondents in Europe, Africa and Asia and some of the best opinion writers in the world.As for the podcast itself, our central aim is to provide listeners with 20 minutes every day that never scrimps on storytelling but is anchored in the news agenda.To achieve that, the  has built a team that feels unique: because it brings together radio documentary makers with news junkies like me. That mix of skills and ideas has lent itself to an incredibly creative team in which everyone is learning a huge amount.And I’ve been really pleased with the pieces that combination of strengths has resulted in already – focusing on interesting news ideas, but telling them in a narrative, audio-rich way that we hope to develop over time. The first few episodes have been well received and have already given us good ideas on what works well.The most exciting thing has been quickly realising the scale of the talent we have to draw on here at the . Having covered politics for many years, I already knew there were excellent reporters in domestic policy areas such as the ’s Patrick Butler, an expert on universal credit, and – of course – Heather and her team in Westminster, with whom we have covered the fast-moving story of Brexit. However, I had not worked with foreign correspondents such as Tom Phillips and Bethan McKernan, whose takes on the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and the war in Yemen combined excellent analysis with powerful and emotional stories from the ground.The format has also allowed us to be experimental, whether that means interviews with external figures such as the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, or spending a day racing around Westminster to give a behind-the-scenes feel on a huge day for news.My co-presenter, India Rakusen, has done powerful episodes: one on poverty in Britain and another on the legacy of the Iraq war, for which Peter Beaumont was able to record for the podcast on the ground.The fact that not many others are producing similar content in the UK means that Today in Focus is inevitably a work in progress in every respect, from the subjects we choose and people we interview to the workflow we follow to get the product completed each day.The overall hope is to bring  stories, told by its reporters alongside their writing, to a wider, younger and more erse audience. And our position, at the centre of a values-based organisation whose global voice has been amplified in the face of political shocks such as the elections of Donald Trump and Brexit, make that something I believe we can achieve.Being based in the  means we can be more credible than many of the websites cheerleading for their favoured politicians, but far more spiky than the BBC.

Then there is an opinion section, where we will hear from  and Observer regulars as well as other voices from outside the building.For me, it’s a bit of a dream job, isn’t it? I get to sit in a studio day after day, discussing really interesting topics with the best journalists in the world, and working alongside some of the best young producers in the country to find new ways to present them. So far, in pilots and for real episodes, I’ve been discussing everything you can imagine, from Trump to Theresa May, the refugee crisis to Brexit, plastics to cocaine.And I’ve already experienced how differently you get to engage with your audience through a podcast. Along with Heather, I’ve been presenting Politics Weekly for the past two years, and I’ve always loved hearing from listeners who say they feel closer to my reporting when presented in that way.Today in Focus is going to be a bit experimental as we try things out with format, style and tone. In time, we will find the voice that we believe works best for us and as a platform for the .

The cost would have been a prohibitive £12,000, so she signed a deal to lease part of her roof to a solar power company, which would fit the panels for free. It would pocket the newly introduced feed-in tariffs (FITs) – subsidies paid by the government for the electricity generated. She, meanwhile, would have lower energy bills. At the end of the 25 years, the panels and the tariffs would be hers.It seemed a win-win situation until recently, when she needed to sell the house. Her buyer’s mortgage application was refused because of the lease agreement, which had effectively signed over a large part of the roof to the solar company.“A clause in the lease allowed us to buy out the panels for a fee to compensate the company for the loss of their FITs,” she says. “We were prepared to do it to be able to sell our house and move on with our lives, but the company had passed the management of the panels on to an agent, who seemed reluctant to let us proceed.”Eventually, after the Observer intervened, Griffiths was allowed to buy the panels for £20,500, an uncosted sum that she was told was non-negotiable. Not only was this nearly double the price she’d have paid to install the system herself, but she had also missed out on nearly eight years of FITs worth, around £7,300. All in all, the “free” system has left her around £16,000 out of pocket.The government introduced the generous incentives in 2010. The FITs, funded by a levy on all energy bills, have encouraged 800,000 households to go solar, but they have also spawned a multitude of startups that have exploited homeowners.Many are discovering the high price of their “free” deal as they try to sell. The 25-year leases apply to the property regardless of who owns it, and they have to find a buyer willing to take on the remaining years. And even if a buyer is happy, mortgage lenders may not be. The deal is treated as a leasehold, and contracts skewed in favour of the company are deemed risky by banks and building societies.Claire Hunt discovered that her elderly father had signed up to a leased solar installation when his roof began leaking. He had been talked into the 25-year contract in 2011, when FITs were at their peak, and the company has since ceased trading.“We were directed to another company which has apparently taken over the contract, but we’ve been unable to engage with them by phone or in writing,” says Hunt. “It is only because of the leak that I have finally had sight of the contract and I am devastated to find there isn’t even a buyout clause to end it. We are therefore arranging to remove the solar panels ourselves and will put them back when completed. A very expensive fix.”Fiona Baker is similarly trapped after agreeing to leased solar panels in 2010. “I am retired with MS and myotonic dystrophy, and need to sell my house, but the buyer won’t go ahead unless I have the panels removed,” she says. “This is apparently not possible until the lease expires at the end of the 25 years.”Meanwhile, Simon Norris is unable to remortgage because the firm that installed his leased panels appears to have breached building regulations. “The lender wanted a structural survey, which concluded that the roof should have been reinforced before the panels were fitted,” he says.Most lenders will agree a loan on a property with leased solar panels provided the contract meets certain conditions, one of them being that the installing company be accredited, the installation be approved and insured, and panels removable without penalties for missed FIT payments. Crucially, a lender’s permission needs to be obtained if an existing borrower decides to install leased panels.In the race to profit from FITs, many companies ignored these conditions. They also did not inform customers of the full value of subsidies they would be entitled to if they bought the panels outright or the implications for current or future mortgages as required by the Renewable Energy Consumer Code (RECC).Since most of the original companies have ceased trading, it can be difficult for sellers and buyers to find out who owns their panels. Jim Cowan recently bought his house without receiving the contract for the leased panels. He can’t find out who owns them since the installing company no longer exists and may find himself unable to remortgage or sell. Householders in this predicament have to submit a subject access request to energy regulator Ofgem’s FIT register team and provide proof that they are the property owners.Government subsidies on solar panels will cease at the end of next March. Miss the deadline and it would take a working household up to 70 years instead of the current 20 to recoup the average £6,500 cost. Those hoping to install panels should get quotes only from companies listed on the RECC website and request a written estimate of the output from the system and the financial benefits. Anyone buying a house with leased solar panels should ensure the contract complies with the minimum requirements laid down by the Council of Mortgage Lenders.* All names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14b8d47b87f129e9ca7f317cfec2b03d47d06861/0_89_3012_1807/master/3012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfb0d4c3a2e2a3cefd02ac436c4b326d","title":"aretha franklin detroit mansion sells auction","story":"The 1927 home is one of several belonging to the soul singer, who died in AugustA Detroit mansion that was owned by Aretha Franklin has been sold for less than half a million dollars.The 5,600-sq-ft brick home, built in 1927 adjacent to the Detroit Golf Club, fetched $300,000 (£233,964) in a sale last month, the Detroit News reported.The great soul singer died in her Detroit riverfront apartment in August, from pancreatic cancer and at the age of 76.

It says that “the UK is facing a national crisis and the future of our country is at stake”.The only item on the meeting’s agenda would be the motion: “This conference believes that the citizens of the UK must have the final say through a people’s vote on the deal proposed by the government for leaving the European Union, with an option to remain in the EU on the ballot paper.“This conference calls on all members and our elected representatives to campaign for a people’s vote with urgency and vigour.”While the grassroots back Corbyn’s leadership, the membership is also heavily in favour of a new vote. Those interested in a special conference want to try to stop it being seen as an attempt to undermine Corbyn, by setting out clearly that it would be called only to endorse another referendum.The last special conference was held under Ed Miliband in 2014 to approve changes in the party’s leadership election rules. Such an event can be held at just 10 days’ notice. All delegates at this year’s Liverpool conference would have the right to attend.Those delegates overwhelmingly backed a policy that ensured a second vote remained an option should it prove impossible to secure a general election. Labour policy is to fight for an election before other options, such as a new poll, are supported. The party could secure an election should it gain a majority in the Commons for a vote of no confidence in the government. That still seems unlikely, although support for May is waning among the Democratic Unionist party, which is threatening to pull the plug on its support for her minority government.Disagreements within Labour are as bitter as ever, with some MPs accusing shadow cabinet members of being bigger supporters of Brexit than Tory Brexiters. However, the party leadership believes Labour must be seen to respect the referendum result.“In the parliamentary party, there’s a group who want a second referendum now, but there is another group – including frontbenchers – who think they can only get behind that publicly after May’s deal has collapsed,” said one shadow minister. “That group is substantial. They can’t shout for it now, but they can once May’s deal has been voted down by parliament. No proposal can command support, so it should go back to the people.”Christina Rees, the shadow Welsh secretary, told a local party meeting last week: “Part of me hopes we never come out, but that’s just a personal issue.” But she added that she accepted the referendum result and defended the party’s current stance.Many Labour MPs are looking for signs of a change of heart by Corbyn. Many were impressed by his performance in the Commons last week, when he dismissed May’s deal as the “blindfold Brexit we all feared”.Others, however, were disheartened by an interview in which he said he did not know how he would vote if there were a second referendum because he did not know what options would be on offer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70a3d28bf9f9aa994c5860863b30c2ff08337d98/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=693eb3201176e3793d66934c093ed6a0","title":"dup prepared to bring down government may brexit deal","story":"Former foreign secretary delivers provocative speech in Belfast in bid to woo Arlene Foster’s partyBoris Johnson warned on Saturday that Britain was “on the verge of making a historic mistake”, as Theresa May arrived in Brussels to sign a Brexit deal that cabinet ministers believe will soon be blocked by parliament.The prime minister is expected to approve the deal on Sunday despite growing certainty among allies and critics alike that she has insufficient support among MPs. She also faces a threat from the DUP, the Northern Irish party propping up her government, which could pull the plug on its support unless there is a rethink of a deal that it has branded “pitiful and pathetic”.On Saturday, as he sought to steel DUP resistance to the deal and to parry Downing Street’s attempt to woo the party’s 10 Westminster MPs, Johnson delivered a provocative address at the party’s conference in Belfast, filled with eclectic references ranging from bendy buses to Star Wars, Van Morrison, former Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez and the Titanic.“If you read the withdrawal agreement, you can see that we are witnessing the birth of a new country called UK(NI) or Ukni,” the former foreign secretary said. “Ukni is no longer exclusively ruled by London or Stormont. Ukni is in large part to be ruled by Brussels.”Insisting that another attempt should be made to draw up a deal, Johnson said the UK should withhold half of the £39bn orce settlement with the EU until a free-trade agreement was agreed by the end of 2020. He also said that the so-called backstop, a measure intended to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, would cleave Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom.“We need to junk the backstop,” he said. Johnson also repeated his call for a bridge to be built between Scotland and Northern Ireland.The criticism of May’s deal did not stop there. Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP, called the deal “pitiful and pathetic”.In her keynote address, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the prime minister was “genuine” in not wanting to harm the union. However, she reiterated the party’s opposition. “We could not support proposals that would open the possibility of ergence in either customs or regulatory measures between Great Britain and Northern Ireland,” she said.Opposition to the Brexit proposals is also building within May’s cabinet. The Observer understands that serving ministers are already planning to try again to demand changes to the deal once it is voted down by the Commons, in a vote expected next month.Scores of Tory MPs are still vowing to vote against the deal, despite desperate attempts by No 10 to convince them that it is the best and only agreement Britain will be offered.In an interview with the Observer, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, urged his colleagues to get behind the prime minister, saying the backstop was designed to kick in only if no other solutions were found for keeping the Irish border open. He said the idea that the EU was involved in a plot to keep the UK locked in was laughable.“I know some of my colleagues have worries that this is a deep plot from Brussels to trap us,” he said. “All I can say is, go and talk to people, whether in Brussels or in national governments. You put that point to them and they just snort with derision or break into laughter. As they see it, the backstop gives the UK access to the EU’s precious single market without the UK paying into the budget and without the UK accepting free movement, and without the UK accepting all the obligations that come from full EU membership.”Lidington said May’s deal was the only one on offer and the only one that could unite the nation after a isive referendum. “It provides a way in which to bring the country together,” he said. He warned those campaigning for a second referendum that it would only “prolong the uncertainty”.“I don’t think anything is certain about a hypothetical second referendum, except that it would not be decisive. It would ide people all over again. It would leave whoever came out on the losing side still resentful. We owe it to the British public and British business to take a decision, get behind this deal and make it work, because I don’t see a better one on offer.”Meanwhile, hardline pro-Brexit former cabinet ministers joined what appeared to be a coordinated effort to torpedo May’s plan and undermine her big moment – calling on her to renegotiate the package and, if this is unsuccessful, prepare the country for a no-deal outcome.David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said that what the prime minister had negotiated was worse than no deal. As far as he and other Tory Brexiters were concerned, it was “now a case of new deal, or no deal”. He said May’s plan had “a near-zero chance of getting through the House of Commons” when a meaningful vote was held, probably in the second week of December.Former international development secretary Priti Patel also called on May to renegotiate the deal, which she said she would definitely vote against in its current form. “We have still got time to get it into a better place and make it more in line with the prime minister’s previous speeches and the Conservative manifesto,” she said.“You can’t go in one direction with one vision and offer lots of reassurance and then come up with something completely different. People are not completely stupid. We are on the verge of losing all faith in our politics and politicians.”Prominent Tory Remainers also attacked the deal as a betrayal of the British people. Former cabinet minister Justine Greening, who backs a second referendum, said it would damage the UK and in particular let down young people. “This deal fixes nothing but risks everything,” she said. “It leaves Britain’s economy and the union in a permanently weak position.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/174cd978ab00388f55b6c4982c5966c596395b10/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=385897ea8437012279835c14a6068c9e","title":"eu wont miss britain after brexit","story":"2016’s Brexit vote brought a surprising unity to the EU27, and that tough stance has not wavered sinceOn 24 June 2016, the day after Britain voted to leave the European Union, Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and Martin Schulz issued the EU’s first formal response to a decision they described in a joint statement as “regrettable”, but said they respected.The bloc stood united, the presidents of the European commission, council and parliament said. Defence of its stability and interests was its priority, so any Brexit agreement with the UK would be “balanced … in terms of rights and obligations”.In the days that followed, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and François Hollande, then France’s president, put meat on the bones of that anodyne little phrase. “There can be,” Merkel told the Bundestag – adopting a term destined to become famous – “no cherry-picking.” There must, she stressed, be “a palpable difference between countries who are members of the European family, and those who are not.”Hollande was even plainer: an “à la carte” EU was not on the menu, he said. Being in the single market “has advantages. The UK must face the consequences of its decision”.Two-and-a-half years on, the withdrawal agreement and political declaration are all but complete, and the first phase of the process is finally over – at least for the EU27.A lot on the continent has changed since. Regret remains, but a page has turned.Schulz has sunk without trace in Germany Hollande is no longer president of France Merkel will not stand again. Populist, far-right and Eurosceptic parties have risen (or returned) to power in Italy, Austria and Hungary and made record gains in Sweden.However, in a famously fractious bloc which is often unable to agree on anything much, the common understanding on Brexit reached, very rapidly, by 27 different capitals in early summer 2016 has not just survived but intensified into an unlikely unity of purpose that, ultimately, made the orce talks’ outcome inevitable.Each inidual EU member state may be facing different consequences and costs from Brexit, and each – as well as the bloc’s central institutions – necessarily has a different experience of the talks. But ask for their top Brexit takeaway so far, and the most common response is: EU solidarity matters, and it works.That, and some surprise at the UK’s ineptitude. “It was clear to most Europeans that the Brexiters’ promises were empty,” said Anna-Lena Högenauer of Luxembourg’s Institute of Political Sciences. “Most, though, thought it was just politics, that there was some kind of plan behind the rhetoric.”The discovery that there was not, Högenauer said, was something of a shock. “The UK basically jumped into the ocean blindfold, and started paddling round in circles. It was almost like it expected the EU not just to say what Brexit should look like, but to devise a version of it that would suit Britain.”Europe’s unity was far from a given at the outset, said Fabian Zuleeg of the European Policy Centre, a leading Brussels thinktank. “There was real regret, of course, but also huge uncertainty, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum,” Zuleeg said. “Real concern, if not fear, of what might come next, and of how the process might unfold.“But it led to a quite remarkable coming together of the EU. The key red lines, and the sequencing, were set very early.”The EU, uncharacteristically, was moving purposefully on. “It was an existential moment,” said Salvador Llaudes, of the Universidad Autónoma of Madrid. “A moment of truth. There was an understanding that a partner was leaving – not just any partner – and that how the EU responded would decide its future.”The foundations of Michel Barnier’s mandate as the European Union’s chief negotiator – no negotiation before article 50 no cherry-picking benefits of the single market without accepting all its obligations no trade talks before Brexit – were laid at an EU summit held less than a week after the referendum. And they have not budged significantly since.“That political mandate was established fast, and Barnier has executed it faithfully,” said Guntram Wolff of the European thinktank Bruegel.“He travelled to all the capitals, took on board every view. It’s proved a highly efficient mechanism, one voice speaking for all.”It helped, Wolff said, that most member states were “only too happy not to have to worry about the day-to-day details of such a complicated and painful procedure. They have a lot of other stuff on their plates. For many, Brexit very quickly became a second-tier, even a third-tier, issue.”The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.\u0026nbspThat committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no ergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026nbspBut it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\u0026nbspThe problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.\u0026nbspThe backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.\u0026nbspThe new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.\u0026nbspBut an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.\u0026nbspThe Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is\u0026nbsp a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspExtending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.\u0026nbspStaying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the\u0026nbspEuropean court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.\u0026nbsp“We are so dependent on an open economy and trade that we started work almost immediately on minimising Brexit’s impact,” De Lange said. “We’ve put in a lot of hard work, really a lot, to ensure a smooth transition, no matter what the Brexit outcome is. We’re prepared.”For Germany, said Ulrich Speck of the German Marshall Fund, economic issues, while real, were largely outweighed by broader geopolitical concerns: “Where will Britain stand on the global stage can it remain an outward-looking country and not be utterly consumed by Brexit?”But Berlin’s overriding priority, Speck said, was “to protect our common European space. If we open it up, it will unravel.“Even in countries with governments sometimes highly critical of the EU, what mattered was not to rock the boat. This has not been about punishing Britain, but about protecting the EU.”And German business, with its formidable car industry, was never going to push Merkel for a soft deal for Britain, as Brexiters fondly imagined, Speck added. “It’s quite simple: German companies care a lot more about the single market than about the British market. Germany’s national interests lie with the EU.”“Britain’s strategic error was to threaten the integrity of the single market” by suggesting that full access and frictionless trade were possible outside it, said Lequesne. “For France and Germany in particular, that’s the EU’s soul.”However, Brexit has also had an impact on the continent’s Eurosceptics, he added. “It’s striking. Before and right after the referendum, the talk was Frexit, Nexit, Czexit. It all stopped very quickly. In France, Marine Le Pen wanted to leave the EU, then the euro, now she wants to leave neither. No one wants to.”In Poland, said Natasza Styczyńska of Jagiellonian university – co-author of a revealing report by the UK in a Changing EU thinktank on EU attitudes to Brexit – the key concerns were the rights of the 1 million-plus Polish citizens in the UK, and the UK’s EU budget contribution.Spain was worried about its corporate interests and citizens in the UK, and for the 300,000-plus Brits in Spain. It “deeply regretted” Brexit, wanted a strong future relationship with the UK – but always saw EU solidarity, and the single market, as greater priorities, Llaudes said.Luxembourg’s key concern was for an orderly Brexit, particularly in arrangements for the financial sector, said Högenauer – but like most EU27 members, the duchy was taken aback by the events that unfolded across the Channel.If the early setting of the EU27’s red lines made it “very hard indeed for the UK to get a grip on any part of the process”, Zuleeg said, Britain really did not help itself: “Normally in negotiations you reach a compromise position, then present it to the other side. Britain couldn’t get to the compromise.”So the government kept postponing any internal decision on its Brexit position. “It could not really use its civil service,” Zuleeg said. “It could not – a huge disadvantage in a negotiation – do any drafting of its own, only try to amend what the EU had already drafted. It could not, actually, negotiate.”So the process so far has been determined by two key factors: the EU’s unity, and Britain’s fundamental, and insoluble, dilemma. “The EU forced it to choose between breaking the political promises made by Brexiters,” said Zuleeg, “or incurring significant economic harm. It couldn’t.”It is a view echoed in several capitals. In Berlin, said Speck, there was “irritation and surprise at the chaos” across the Channel. “Everyone reads the UK papers here. We saw it all, every comment, every contradiction ... People were laughing – rolling their eyes – at some of the most extreme, the most arrogant, stuff.”If the unpleasant rhetoric was amusing, the sheer length of time the UK took to publish its Brexit white paper was frustrating, and the ultimatums (“my plan or no plan”) and clumsy diplomatic attempts at ide-and-rule were annoying.But it was the UK’s many and persistent delusions – on “frictionless trade” as a third country on a special cake-and-eat-it deal on avoiding a hard Irish border while leaving the single market and maintaining territorial integrity on viewing the EU as a political arrangement, not a legal order – that have ultimately proved fatal.With the deal sealed on the EU side, Zuleeg said he now expects it to pass through the House of Commons, possibly on a second vote. “The economic pressure will be enormous,” he said. “But we now have to negotiate the worst trade deal in history – the only one that’s a reduction on what we have.“All the big issues: fisheries, Gibraltar, will come back with a vengeance, with the backstop hanging over us. It’s not over yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f680e1850d8bfdeaf4c9c7089e640b72f9f2c148/0_13_5046_3028/master/5046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9abb09b7a3df9d545b0a3088636763d6","title":"may begs public unite behind me brexit open letter","story":"PM writes direct letter to British voters after agreeing to Spain’s demands over GibraltarAn increasingly desperate Theresa May on Sunday appeals to the British people to unite behind her Brexit deal as she calls on Leavers and Remainers to end hostilities and use the UK’s departure from the European Union to usher in a period of national “renewal and reconciliation”.With criticism of the package negotiated by the prime minister and EU leaders continuing to grow, and a new row erupting on Saturday night over Gibraltar, May attempts to go over the heads of warring politicians in her own party by publishing a letter directly “to the British people”.In a bid to persuade the public to apply pressure to their own MPs to back her deal in a crucial vote in parliament next month, the prime minister says in the letter that the country must “get on with Brexit now” so that ministers can focus on what matters most to people in their everyday lives – improving the NHS, building more homes and tackling injustices.The letter has been distributed to the media and published on a new government website.Promising to campaign for the deal with her “heart and soul” before the crucial Commons vote next month, May says Brexit day, on 29 March next year, “must mark the point when we put aside the labels of ‘Leave’ and ‘Remain’ for good and we come together again as one people”.But as she headed to Brussels on Saturday night for a summit at which the 27 EU leaders are expected to sign off on both the withdrawal agreement and a separate political declaration, outlining the UK’s future relationship with the EU, senior Conservatives from both the Leave and Remain wings of her party appeared to be hardening their opposition to her plans and vowing to vote it down.Several former cabinet ministers who served under the prime minister said she would have to go back to Brussels to renegotiate the package, as it would never pass through the Commons in its current form.Speaking at the conference of the Democratic Unionist party in Belfast, which props up May’s government, the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said the UK would become “a satellite state” under May’s plans and called for the backstop agreement, tortuously negotiated as a way to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, to be “junked”.“If we are not careful, we are going to stay in the customs union, we are going to stay in the single market, we are going to be rule-takers,” Johnson said. “Unless we junk this backstop, we will find that Brussels has got us exactly where they want us – a satellite state.”The former Brexit secretary David Davis said he could not vote for the deal, which would leave the UK tied to the EU’s customs union and with no unilateral power to decide when to leave it. May’s deal, he said, had “a near-zero chance of getting through the House of Commons”, adding that the options were now “new deal or no deal”.May was criticised on Saturday night by Brexiters for agreeing to Spanish demands regarding the future of Gibraltar, after Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, threatened to veto the Brexit deal.Britain’s ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, made clear that Gibraltar would not necessarily be covered by a future trade deal with the EU – a key demand that they suggest will not now be met by the UK side. Stewart Jackson, former chief of staff to Davis, said the “Gibraltar surrender” could end up being “the straw that breaks the camel’s back”. However, May insisted on Saturday night that issues around Gibraltar’s sovereignty had not changed and would not change.Strong support for May came from her de facto deputy, the Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, who warned in an interview with the Observer that failure to back May could have catastrophic consequences. He said if there were a no-deal outcome resulting from MPs voting down the deal, the unity of the United Kingdom would be threatened and a “profound economic shock” would be triggered. Lidington said that “part of the political reality” was that “Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the European Union”.Lidington dismissed alternative plans put forward by Johnson and the prominent Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg for a Canada-style deal that would see Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK, saying it was not on the table.“The idea that there is some alternative that was capable of being negotiated is simply not the case,” he insisted. Lidington added: “Every member of parliament, whichever political party they represent, has got to really think through where the interest of the country lies when we come to the meaningful vote on the deal. A vote against the deal would be a vote to prolong and make worse the uncertainty for business. A vote against the deal would be to put at risk living standards and security of employment and investment in our own country.”After Spain won the reassurances over Gibraltar, the European council’s president, Donald Tusk, said he would recommend that the EU approve the deal. “No one has reasons to be happy. But at least at this critical time the EU27 has passed the test of unity and solidarity,” he said.If the deal is approved by the EU on Sunday, May will spend the next fortnight campaigning for it up and down the country before seeking parliament’s approval, probably in the second week of December.But with Labour and up to 85 Tories saying they are likely to vote against, few see how she can avoid going down to defeat. The former cabinet minister Justine Greening, who backs a second referendum, united with Brexiters in condemning May’s plans. “This deal fixes nothing but risks everything. It leaves Britain’s economy and the union in a permanently weak position,” Greening said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43ec5eac2517131129abbb52b0f0b47d331cb273/0_154_5484_3290/master/5484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8c66e02a0a5610de91bc2be55df1ba4","title":"brexit eu summit deal theresa may leaders meet for emergency summit to sign off uks withdrawal agreement politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the EU summit in Brussels, where Theresa May and other EU leaders are agreeing the Brexit withdrawal agreement and political declaration on the future relationshipJean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European council, is next up.Speaking in French, he says it is a sad day.Here are more quotes from what Mark Rutte, the Dutch PM, said when asked what would happen if the UK parliament voted down the deal. At first he replied:I am absolutely confident that Theresa May has everything now on the table to argue for a majority in the British parliament.Then, when pressed on whether the EU might offer more, he said:I don’t expect a no vote, I expect a yes vote. And this is the deal on the table. I don’t think there’s anything more, no.So that meant the EU would not be willing to offer more? Rutte replied:I don’t want to contemplate a no vote. I think it will be a yes vote. In general, I think this is the max we can all do. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, is here now. He gives a statement to reporters.He says he thinks it would be better if the UK stayed in the EU. But he respects its decision to leave. They have negotiated an agreement that will protect the economy, he says. It has been a very difficult deal to negotiate. But he expects it to be approved.Like Michel Barnier earlier, Varadkar does not respond to questions after he has finished his statement. He says he will take questions after the summit is over.Antonio Tajani, the president of the European parliament, is here now. He says the European parliament supports the deal.The European parliament is in favour of this agreement. It is a good agreement for both.Asked repeatedly what will happen if the UK parliament votes the deal down, he refuses to speculate, just saying that he wants to be optimistic.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, is here. He says this negotiation has been very complicated, and very difficult. He says he has worked with the full unity of the EU 27, enjoying their personal trust.He has worked with his team to negotiate with the UK, “never against the UK”. Now it is time for everybody to take their responsibility, everybody.He says this deal is necessary to build trust, and to establish the next phase of the partnership. The EU and the UK will remain “allies and friends”.Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, is here now. He says Theresa May has fought hard and got a good outcome. He says, for the EU, there is “an acceptable deal” on the table.But he says he hates Brexit.Q: Is there any chance Brexit won’t happen?I don’t think so, says Rutte. I believe that nobody is winning. We are all losing because the UK is leaving . But, given that context, this is a balanced outcome with no political winners or victories. But it is acceptable. I think it is acceptable, for the 27 countries moving forward, as well as for the UK.Q: What do you think of what is happening in the UK?Rutte says there is a debate in the UK. But May has fought “very hard”.If he were living in the EU, he would vote for it, he says. He says it is a “very balanced” deal.Q: And if you were a British MP?Rutte says he would vote for the deal. It delivers on Brexit, and also protects vital interests.Q: And what happens if the Commons votes it down? Will the EU renegotiate?This is the deal on the table. I don’t think there is anything more ... This is the max we can all do.UPDATE: See 8.26am for a slightly fuller version of this quote.Here are some more quotes from Dalia Grybauskaitė, the president of Lithuania.Asked why EU leaders were agreeing this deal when it was likely to be rejected by the UK parliament, she replied:She was also asked how the EU got Spain to agree to come to this summit, given the problem over Gibraltar. She replied:Usually there are some, I can joke, tricks – we promise to promise.She also said EU leaders were not happy about today’s development.I’m not sure that orce could be perfect at all ... Nothing good in that for all sides ... I will not say we are very happy. I think that the feeling of the withdrawal of Britain, and its reality, is in our minds.The arrivals have started. You can watch them on a live feed here. And the first person here is Dalia Grybauskaitė, the president of Lithuania. She says she and other EU leaders are not feeling very happy about this.There is nothing good for any side, because it is withdrawal from the European Union.She says the process ahead is long.Q: What happens if the UK parliament rejects this deal?Everything could happen, she says. There are at least four options, she says, including a referendum, and election, and new negotiations.Q: Are you worried the PM will not get this through parliament?That is not our concern, says Grybauskaitė. She says that’s a British concern.According to the Financial Times, there was a very odd moment when Theresa May was meeting Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, earlier this year and Merkel said it was time to start thinking of a “celebratory” moment that would mark the Brexit deal. “Celebratory”? May was confused. But, as the FT goes on:Soon enough it became clear that Ms Merkel’s intentions had been lost in translation: the zelebrieren she had in mind was a solemn commemoration, more akin to a Lutheran church service than independence jamboree.Today that moment has arrived. EU leaders are meeting in Brussels to sign of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the legally-binding treaty that will set the terms of the UK’s departure from the EU, and the political declaration on the framework for the future relationship, the much shorter and vaguer outline for the future trade relationship.Both documents are agreed and so we are not expecting any significant changes. If it runs to schedule, the summit will be over by lunchtime. But it is nevertheless a huge moment in the Brexit process.And May and other leaders will be addressing the media. For May, the big question is how will she get this through the Commons. And for the other EU leaders, the big question is, if parliament votes this down, will they be willing to renegotiate.Here is the Observer’s overnight story.And here is the text of the letter from May addressed to the nation released overnight.Here is the agenda for the day. All times are UK times.7.30am: EU leaders start arriving at the summit.9am: The EU 27 meet to discuss the deal.9am: Iain Duncan Smith, the leading Tory Brexiter, and James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, are among the guests on Sophy Ridge on Sunday.10am: Theresa May joins the other EU leaders in Brussels to discuss the next steps.10am: Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, and Tony Blair, the former prime minister, are among the guests on the Andrew Marr Show.11am: Donald Tusk, president of the European council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, hold a press conference to mark the end of the summit.

And he can comfort and entertain, bedazzle with words and jokes and defiance.The former foreign secretary did not disappoint the Democratic Unionist party at its annual party conference in Belfast on Saturday.The party feels besieged and betrayed, with the Brexit dream turning into a nightmare, but Johnson offered succour and solidarity in this one-night only performance across the Irish Sea.“Without you it is likely that the mighty engine of the UK economy would have stuttered and stalled. And indeed if it was not for you then there is a risk that the union itself would have been placed in jeopardy.”The words were balm. Here, at least, was one friend in a world turned cold.A scandal over renewable energy and Northern Ireland’s collapsed power-sharing executive have alienated some core supporters. Most Northern Ireland voters voted to stay in the EU. Usually quiescent farming and business leaders loudly defy the party over the Brexit deal.The DUP thought Theresa May was in its pocket until the backstop made her a Quisling. Brussels plots against them, Dublin rubs its hands and now even some arch Brexiteers say the UK would be better off staying in the EU.So here was Johnson to steel nerves and restore the faith. It was a strange type of reassurance.“This deal risks yet further economic and political humiliation,” he said. “We are locking ourselves in by treaty and making it impossible to negotiate our way out.”“We would have to leave Northern Ireland behind as an economic semi-colony of the EU and we would be damaging the fabric of the union.”“Unless we junk this backstop, we will find that Brussels has got us exactly where they want us – a satellite state.”They hooted and stamped.“You can see that we are witnessing the birth of a new country called Ukni. Ukni is no longer exclusively ruled by London or Stormont. Ukni is in large part to be ruled by Brussels.”Visions of Armageddon greeted with masochistic glee because it meant they were not mad, not alone. Someone else agreed with them that the backstop was indeed an existential threat and that no deal was a better option, give or take economic calamity.It did not matter that Johnson has himself lost friends and influence since quitting the cabinet. “He reminds me of Trump,” said Ann Storey, 64, a cafe owner and longtime DUP member. The comparison was a compliment. “It’s the hair and the attitude.”Margaret Lang, 74, a retired Marks \u0026amp Spencer worker, appreciated Johnson’s support: “The DUP is fighting hard. They’re good people and know what they’re doing. It’s good to have Boris. He’s entertaining.”Her friend Sylvia Johnston, 82, agreed: “He’s a very interesting man, though he talks very quickly.”She wasn’t wrong. In between visions of the glories that await, should Britain stare down Brussels and do a proper Brexit, Johnson wove in bendy buses, Star Wars, light sabers, Van Morrison, Hugo Chavez, the Titanic and repeated a call to build a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland. He earned a standing ovation.There were some dissenters. “Today’s highlight? The lemon meringue dessert,” said one member. A half-joke because she too seemed optimistic that somehow Brexit, and the DUP’s parlous position, would end well.William Walker, a councillor from Newry, agreed. “A good vibe today.”You could feel it in the panel discussion titled “sharing the prosperity: a regional approach to inclusive growth in the UK”, with upbeat scenarios about a coming golden age of Brexit. The conference centre rooms were named after plants. This one was called Hemlock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c1dd1d575f8dee0c717debee4e1a95eec49fdc/0_241_3643_2185/master/3643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27555ed06367f50a3ff3e1c6bd8b1e87","title":"denisovan neanderthal hybrid denny dna finder project","story":"After the unearthing of a Neanderthal-Denisovan fossil, UK scientists are using groundbreaking techniques to learn more of the species’ complex bonds with humansOf all the ancient peoples that have been studied by scientists, none has set puzzles quite so profound as those left behind by the Denisovans. Only a few tiny pieces of bone and teeth have ever been found of this long extinct species – fragmentary remains that would all fit snugly inside a cigarette packet.At present, researchers have few answers to these questions, such is the paucity of the Denisovan fossil record. But a new project, Finder – Fossil Fingerprinting and Identification of New Denisovan Remains from Pleistocene Asia – which has been just been launched with backing from the European Research Council, aims to put that right and transform our knowledge of the Denisovans and their relations with both Homo sapiens and the Neanderthals. All three species interbred, we now know, and a key aim of the study is to help understand these complex bondings: Denisovans will be a special focus, however.“We aim to find out where they lived, when they came into contact with modern humans – and why they went extinct,” says project leader Katerina Douka, of the Max Planck Institute in Jena, Germany and a visitor at Oxford University.Denisovan research faces a basic problem, however – paucity of fossils. Denisova Cave in Siberia – where their eponymous remains were first found in 2010 – is our sole source, and only a handful of fossils have ever been dug up there (along with several Neanderthal pieces).“It is a wonderful site,” says Tom Higham, deputy director of Oxford University’s Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit and an adviser to Finder. “It is cool inside, so DNA in bones does not disintegrate too badly. However, nearly all the bones there have been chewed up by hyenas and other carnivores.” As a result, Denisova’s cave floor is littered with tiny, unidentifiable bone fragments.“You cannot tell whether a piece comes from a mammoth or a sheep – or a man or woman,” adds Higham. “Only a very few will be human, though they are certainly worth finding – they could tell us so much.”Current techniques for identifying bone fragments involve the time-consuming process of extracting and sequencing DNA. “That takes far too long to be practical,” says Higham. “There are tens of thousands of bits of bones here.”However, Douka and Higham will use a new technology called Zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry – ZooMs. Developed by Mike Buckley, at Manchester University, the technique, which is derived from food science research, exploits the fact that collagen, a protein fibre found in bone, can survive for hundreds of thousands of years. Every major mammal group has a distinctive type of collagen, and ZooMs can read its structure like a molecular barcode, identifying which animal was the originator of a particular bone. This makes it ideal for differentiating human and animal remains.“We asked Anatoly Derevyanko and Mikhail Shunkov, who direct the cave’s excavations, for samples – and they gave us a big bag full of bits of bones. All the fragments were considered to be unidentifiable,” says Douka.The team began to prepare the bones. A 20mg slice was cut from each and placed in a test tube and given an identification code. After three months, 150 samples had been prepared. “That was nowhere near enough,” says Higham.So Douka and Higham asked their postgraduate students for a volunteer to work on the project. “No one came forward,” says Higham. “A week went by, then a fortnight. I was beginning to get worried. Then an Australian student, Samantha Brown, knocked on my door and volunteered to work the bones as part of her master’s dissertation. She saved the day.”Over the next few weeks, Brown undertook the laborious task of cutting and labelling tiny slices from each bone fragment. “I eventually prepared about 700 samples,” she recalls. These were then taken to Manchester for analysis in Buckley’s laboratory. “The results showed we had a lot of cow bones, a few other animals but no humans,” says Brown. “It was very disappointing.”At that point, Brown could have left the project with honour. But she chose to go on. “Thank God she did,” says Higham. A further 1,500 Denisova bone samples were prepared by her and then taken to Manchester. This time, the results were spectacularly different. One bone, number 1,227, was identified as being from a human species.“We could not believe that it had actually worked. It was wonderful,” says Douka. Brown was also overjoyed. “It was unbelievably exciting. We had not only shown the technique works but we had found a hominin. And I had been prepared for the worst.”It was tremendous news for the team. But their discovery lacked a key piece of information. Yes, they had found a human of some kind, but which species? ZooMs can tell only if a bone comes from a member of the hominidae family, which includes great apes and humans, including Homo sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans. It cannot differentiate within this group. “There have never been great apes around Denisova so that meant we had to have found a piece of a human,” says Higham. “But which species?”To find out, the sample was taken to Svante Pääbo at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, whose team had sequenced the first Denisovan genome in 2010. Initial analysis showed that the bone was more than 50,000 years old and from a person who had been 13 or older when they died.Then the Leipzig team – led by Pääbo’s student Viviane Slon – began more detailed genetic analysis and made a startling discovery. Exactly half the sample consisted of Neanderthal DNA. The other half was made up of Denisovan DNA. At first, the researchers assumed that the sample was contaminated. “I thought they must have screwed up something,” says Pääbo.But re-testing confirmed the finding: the Oxford team had discovered the 90,000-year-old remains of a hybrid daughter of a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father. She was nicknamed Denny. “If you had asked me beforehand, I would have said we will never find this, it is like finding a needle in a haystack,” Pääbo told Nature.To discover a first-generation person of mixed ancestry was extraordinary. But there were more revelations to come. Further detailed studies of the genes of Denny’s Denisovan father were found to contain fragments of Neanderthal DNA. These indicated that interbreeding between the two species had also occurred at an earlier time.At first sight, Denny’s remarkable ancestry suggests that Neanderthals and Denisovans must have mated with each other regularly. But Douka counsels caution. “The DNA of Neanderthals and Denisovans are distinct. We can easily tell them apart. That argues against frequent interbreeding. Otherwise they would have ended up with the same DNA.”Past studies have provided clear evidence that Denisovans and modern humans interbred, and also that Neanderthals and modern humans mated with each. Now, thanks to ZooMs – which has since been used to pinpoint other ancient human remains – there is dramatic evidence of Denisovan and Neanderthal intermingling. But why at Denisova?One suggestion is that the cave represents a border outpost for both species, one that was situated at the very eastern edge of the range of the Neanderthals, who were primarily a European species, and at the very western tip of the homelands of the Denisovans, who were an eastern species. Occasionally members from both groups would have reached the cave at the same time – with amorous consequences.It is an idea borne out by detailed studies of Denny’s Neanderthal mother. Her genes show a particularly close affinity with Neanderthals who lived in Croatia, suggesting that the immediate predecessors of Denny’s mother may have been part of a group who slowly migrated east from Europe towards Denisova – where she encountered Denny’s father at the outer edges of each other’s homelands.It is an intriguing picture, though much more information is required to confirm it. Scientists have no direct evidence that the Denisovans’ homeland range was primarily to the east of the cave, although the fact that their genes have been detected in the DNA of populations in Australia, New Guinea and other parts of Oceania, provides support for this idea and suggests future searches for sites should be focused on eastern Russia, China and south-east Asia.A great deal more needs to be learned about the Denisovans, says Higham: “What was their distribution? What is the earliest evidence for their emergence from the common ancestor they shared with Neanderthals 500,000 years ago? If we could get a bone or two from other sites, that would be tremendously helpful.” One possible source of fossils could include remains of ancient humans that were placed in museums in Asia decades ago. These could be wrongly labelled, and could be Denisovans, researchers suggest. Unfortunately, it has proved difficult to get hold of these specimens for sampling.For their part, Douka and Higham are planning on a number of approaches. One of these will be to collaborate with researchers in Chinese laboratories, teaching them how to use ZooMs, and how to use the technology to uncover more Denisovan sites.“ZooMs is going to be crucial to this project,” says Douka. “We have shown that it is a powerful tool for pinpointing human fossils. That makes it ideal for tracking down Denisovans.”Knowledge of the Denisovan people emerged from studies of ancient genomes, which began 20 years ago when scientists first developed techniques for extracting DNA from fossils and for creating copies of that genetic material which allowed them to study it.Scientists at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig were studying bones and teeth found in Denisova cave in the Altai Mountains in Siberia, where Neanderthal fossils had been found. One bone and one tooth, they discovered, belonged to a previously unknown species of ancient human.These few fossils proved to be spectacularly rich in genetic material, allowing scientists to sequence entire genomes. It is this detailed information about the Denisovan genome that has demonstrated they interbred with modern humans. Descendants of these unions, carrying small amounts of Denisovan DNA, went on to settle in Melanesia and Australia thousands of years ago.In this way, we can see Denisovan DNA in that of modern humans, though we have no idea what the Denisovans looked like or where, exactly, they lived."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e98d54f3d411d57d0cf377abec2a4e3cccb742/0_230_6894_4136/master/6894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28989466dcc5fb6a68b0d47795909c03","title":"tell us do you work in a food bank share your stories","story":"If you work in a food bank in the UK, we’d like to hear from you.

It wasn’t great but it’s no disaster. Now I’ve just got to play well in one more classical and see what happens.”Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1.

The American challenger and world No 2 was first to deviate, castling on the kingside (7. O-O) instead of the Nc6 he’d played in St Louis.A briefly promising double-edge position took shape with (8. Qd2 Nd7 9. O-O-O Nf6 10. Bd3 c5), but Carlsen expended 23 minutes on his next two moves (11. Rhe1 Be6 12. Kb1 Qa5) and admitted he’d been thrown for a curve once more by Caruana’s exhaustively researched opening preparation and not for the first time during the fortnight. Eventually the champion offered up a queen exchange with 13. c4 and the ladies were off the board (13. ... Qxd2 14. Bxd2), abruptly stripping the tension from the affair.“I wasn’t pleased from the opening and then after that I just wanted to play it safe,” Carlsen said. “I was trying to push a little bit, but it’s nothing real. In this match situation I thought there was no reason to go crazy.”The action soon entered an opposite-colored bishop endgame which Caruana held with no problems before consenting to a 55-move draw after two hours and 13 minutes, the shortest game of the match so far.The 11 straight draws represent the longest streak of games to open a match without a decisive result in the recognized 132-year history of world championship play. The previous mark was set during the 1995 meeting between Garry Kasparov and Viswanathan Anand, which started with eight consecutive draws before Kasparov broke through en route to a 10½-7½ victory.The players will look forward to another rest day on Sunday before the competition resumes on Monday at the College in Holborn with Game 12, where a decisive result could lift the winner over the 6½-point threshold and determine an outright winner in the €1m ($1.14m) showdown.“There’s a lot riding on the last game,” said the 26-year-old Caruana, who will play with the white pieces in a one-off that could make him only the second American-born player to capture the world championship after Bobby Fischer in 1972. “It will be very tense for both of us. I’m not going to go crazy or anything, of course, but I will try to put pressure on him.”He added: “What can I say? It’s going to be a tough game. At this point the tension is sort of at its peak. If I knew what would happen I would tell you.”Should Monday’s final classical game end in another bloodless result, Carlsen will be a prohibitive favorite in Wednesday’s tie-breaker, which consists of a series of games under tighter time controls. The Norwegian, who in addition to his No 1 ranking is the world’s top rated rapid player and top rated blitz player (compared to Caruana’s respective ratings of No 8 and No 16), is unbeaten in tie-breakers over the last 13 years.“We’ll see what happens,” said Carlsen, who extended a career-high streak of 16 straight draws stretching back to last month’s European Club Cup in Porto Carras, Greece. “A lot depends on what (Caruana) wants to do. If he wants to shut it down then that’s fine by me, we’ll play rapid (on Wednesday).“Otherwise we’ll have a fight.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/680be7ef425255bada62c886b4fcebd753f6fa19/0_183_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3edfdea3c4da0e6b0fad08b9dd35630","title":"australia sink england to claim womens world t20 title","story":"Two years ago, in the World Twenty20 semi-final in Delhi, England suffered a humiliation at the hands of Australia: a six-run loss, courtesy of a collapse that saw them lose seven wickets for 60 runs. In the interim they have changed their captain, blooded new players and won a World Cup.Even so there was a sense of deja vu today as they subsided from 30-1 to 105 all out, the equation this time nine wickets lost for 75 runs. Once again, it was the old enemy Australia who were their nemesis, storming to their fourth World T20 title by eight wickets.For Australia it was their young leg-spinner Georgia Wareham who unexpectedly stole the show in her first ever outing against England, finishing with 2-11, a catch and a direct hit run-out to her name.“It’s unreal - it hasn’t sunk in just yet,” Wareham said. “Getting the opportunity on the world stage has been enormous for me, and done lots for my cricket. It’s an amazing feeling.”Ashleigh Gardner (33*) and Meg Lanning (28*) then shared a 62-run partnership, Lanning stroking the winning single through the off-side after Gardner punished two huge sixes over Kirstie Gordon’s head to ensure the victory came in style, with 29 balls to spare.Wareham’s big contributions had come at opposite ends of the England innings. It was her run out of Amy Jones with a direct hit from midwicket that started the rot, the star of England’s semi-final short of her ground by 2 metres, leaving her side 30-2 at the end of the powerplay. Eight overs later Wareham demolished the defences of the late-middle order, seeing off Lauren Winfield and Sophia Dunkley with successive deliveries. The Winfield wicket required an astute DRS review, the original on-field decision overturned after the ball tracker showed it would be hitting middle stump.Though Knight safely played out Wareham’s hat-trick ball, the damage had already been done, the England captain’s sparky 25 unable to successfully prop up the middle order. Wareham finally had her number in the 18th over, snaffling a good catch at mid-off to give fellow spinner Gardner (3-22) her third wicket of the day. By that time it was clear that England had fallen a fair way short of a par total.On another day in another final 4,000 miles away, Anya Shrubsole had made sure an under-par total was enough: not this time. Player of the Tournament Alyssa Healy got Australia’s chase going early by punishing Shrubsole for three boundaries in her first over of the day: the bowler’s frustration was clear.Healy eventually added just 22 runs to her tournament tally, bowled by Sophie Ecclestone in the fifth over, and opening partner Beth Mooney also fell cheaply, caught behind when on 14. Even at 44-2, though, Australia seemed largely in control of the situation: Gardner and Lanning did the rest.Earlier, it had been Australia who blinked first, their fielding going awry in the opening overs as usually reliable players let boundaries through their legs and dropped crucial catches. England’s top scorer Danni Wyatt should have gone early, Rachael Haynes spilling a difficult chance at point in the second over of the day.Four balls later Healy herself made a rare error, putting down a flying high catch behind the stumps, giving Wyatt yet another life. It meant that Ellyse Perry had to wait a little longer for her 100th T20 wicket: when it finally came, it did so in trademark fashion, a yorker that trapped Nat Sciver LBW.Wyatt, though, ploughed on, finally coming to the party in this World Twenty20 after a run of low scores. She took 11 off Sophie Molineux’s first over, dancing down the track to send the ball back over the left-armer’s head and forcing an early bowling change from Lanning.Dropped on 11, 12 and 34, Australia took four attempts to get rid of her: she was eventually deceived 7 runs short of her half-century by a flighted delivery from Gardner, finally finding a safe pair of hands in Meg Lanning at cover. Had she batted out the innings England might have salvaged a decent total, but then Wyatt has always been a live by the sword, die by the sword kind of a player.Their under-par showing in the final completes what has been a difficult World Twenty20 with the bat for England, only Amy Jones finishing in the top ten tournament run-scorers. For Australia, meanwhile, the challenge was always to live up to pre-tournament expectations which put them as clear favourites: today’s clinical victory shows they have done just that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c51707930ed420f0d9322b6c6ee746231d0dfc4/0_115_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35288173029c3414dd5aa0a6d41d3a3c","title":"australia v india third twenty20 international live","story":"The drop doesn’t cost India much in the end. Finch goes for a sweep against the wrist-spinner, gets a big top edge and it’s taken comfortably at short fine. Short is fine, Finch is gone. Maxwell gets promoted to first drop instead of Lynn.Dropped! Could be a huge miss from the first ball of Krunal Pandya’s over. The left-arm ortho was smashed by Glenn Maxwell at the Gabba. He has the chance to dismiss Australia’s captain with the first ball of his night. But Finch’s huge swing goes a mile up into the Sydney evening sky, and by the time it comes down Rohit Sharma coming in from long-on has misjudged it utterly, and lets it slip through his hands and through his lap down low. Then another fumble by Bumrah at backward point lets through Short’s cut shot for four. Finch cuts a four of his own to finish the over. A big one for Australia.This is on the PA now. Liking the musical action tonight. Just stop doing it at Test matches, please.7th over: Australia 52-0 (Short 26, Finch 22) Kuldeep Yadav is on, and this will be the contest central to the result. If the Australians can get through him at a run a ball without a wicket, that’s a win. His left-arm leg breaks are very hard to attack. If they can sack more runs from him, then great. But if they try, they’re every chance to cough up several wickets to his work. He concedes three runs, which should have been one except that KL Rahul misfielded Short’s cut shot at backward point. Kohli not happy. Finch had to survive a raucous appeal, but was probably hit outside the line. The opening stand passes fifty.6th over: Australia 49-0 (Short 24, Finch 21) Last over of the Powerplay. Finch’s two men out are in the deep behind square. He goes straight to the fine leg stopper with a glance for a single. That fine leg position is up for Short, who nearly beats him with a paddle. But not quite. Just one run. A bit of Underworld playing over the PA between deliveries, nice choice by the DJ. Drive boy, dog boy, dirty numb angel boy. It’s going well for Bumrah until he bowls a wide full toss that Finch can slap through point for an easy four. A decent haul from the Powerplay without being huge. No wicket lost does lean it further Australia’s way.5th over: Australia 41-0 (Short 18, Finch 19) Khaleel Ahmed again, and whacked again. Short ball, shoulder height, but Finch gets up over the top of it and muscles the hook shot through square for four. The next ball is full and outside off. Finch I suspect had premeditated for the length but not the line: he goes for a huge hit aiming to leg, and drags it high to plug in a gap at deep midwicket. Aims another huge shot at width and nearly chops on, the inside edge coming back into Finch’s boot which saves his stumps. Short scrambles a run, then creams his own pull shot but just for a single, India have protection for Short at deep backward in the Powerplay. So Finch is on strike for the last ball, picks the slower ball, and comes a bit inside out at it, blasting it at catchable height but into the gap between cover and mid-off. 4th over: Australia 28-0 (Short 17, Finch 8) Jasprit Bumrah to bowl, with his clockwork soldier straight-arm action. Gives Short a bit of width, not much, but just enough, and Short caresses the cut shot, precision rather than his usual power, and split the difference between point and backward to race for four. But Bumrah is a quality pace operator, and he beats Short with the next ball trying a similar shot. Seven fieldsmen all back on the edge of the ring as the bowler starts each run-up. The batsmen get just three singles from the next five balls as those fieldsmen are sharp and Bumrah gives little away.3rd over: Australia 21-0 (Short 11, Finch 7) A big thump to start the over, as Short sees a ball full enough from Bhuvneshwar and powers it over the bowler’s head for four on the bounce. But some good ground fielding ties Short down from the next four balls, unable to beat the field. The sixth ball is short enough for a whip-pull off the hip to deep backward for one. A good duel there.2nd over: Australia 16-0 (Short 6, Finch 7) Khaleel is next with the ball, the left-armer coming over the wicket. Trying to work away just outside Finch’s off stump, but despite that line and the angle across, Finch crunches a pull shot from a ball that wasn’t especially short. Speaking of baseball style, that was an example. A base hit rather than a homer though, all the way along the ground for four. Finch plays again on that line and punches two off the back foot. In between times, Khaleel sends down a couple of wides. Finch goes for a wander after a drive and has to ground his bat quickly as Kohli throws down the stumps from cover, then Finch under-edges a big swipe on the bounce to the keeper to end the over.1st over: Australia 8-0 (Short 6, Finch 1) Short elects to take strike to start the match, where Finch usually does. It doesn’t make much difference as Short picks up a single from Bhuvneshwar first ball. Finch gets the inducker that hits him on the pad, Bhuvi so good at that against right handers. Gets off strike next ball, and Short lashes a nice wide one through cover with an angled bat. Looks good on the off side though most of his BBL hitting is baseball style to leg. Gets Finch back on strike only for Finch to be hit on the pad again. This time it’s high and Short is sharp enough to scamper a leg bye.Interesting – the Indians prefer chasing. But Aaron Finch still wants to put a score on the board. That Starc change has indeed been made, Behrendorff a bit unlucky to miss out. Coulter-Nile will stay in for the injured Stanlake. India won’t make any changes from Melbourne.Rain rain, stay away. We’re not supposed to get any in Sydney for this game tonight, after the first match in Brisbane was reduced and the second in Melbourne was abandoned. But for the big harbour town in New South Wales, the forecast reads “Large and powerful surf conditions in the afternoon and evening are expected to be hazardous for coastal activities such as rock fishing, swimming and surfing.” Watch out you rock fishers. Unless you’re the disciple Peter, in which case you are both a rock and a fisher. The abandonment means that the home side leads the series 1-0. India can square it with a win, Australia desperately want to seal it and create some good news before the Test season starts. Mitch Starc has come into the squad for Billy Stanlake, not sure if that means he’s straight into the XI or not. The main question for India is whether spinner Yuzvendra Chahal comes into the XI for the first time this series.

His invocation of ‘Heavens to Betsy’ immediately recalled from the dark, dank recesses of time the alternative phrase ‘Heavens to Murgatroyd’. This was a catchphrase of the Hanna Barbera cartoon character Snagglepuss (originally of Quickdraw McGraw fame before the Yogi Bear Show), but apparently originated with the actor Bert Rahr from the 1944 film ‘Meet The People’. In the etymological spirit of this morning, it transpires that the surname Murgatroyd may derive from the Norse ‘Moor Gate Royd’ which translates as ‘a clearing in the forest on the road to the moor’. Not many people know that, as a fellow East Ender might say.”I know this is all a bit Monster Munch is smaller, where the white dog turds, but tangentially, why are cartoons so crap these days? Where are Your Tom and Jerrys, Your Willy Fogs, Your Cities of Golds? Also, a shame of satellite television is the dedicated kids’ channels unkids never get to watch the above because they’re the only thing on. Sandakan spins it away from Moeen, who follows it looking to glance away he edges, and De Silva, moving right, takes a terrific catch in the midriff, now moving left. That was going very quickly indeed, and suddenly Sri Lanka might be chasing something manageable.46th over: England 171-6 (Moeen 22, Foakes 2) Perera nails Foakes on the pad and there’s a shout, but impact was outside the line. Two singles from the over. “I’ve never been more happily wrong than I was about Buttler making it Test cricket. It’s not about talent, because his rubbery, fast-twitch wrists could bat on an ice rink, but it just felt he was too non-conformist and his shipown had sailed a few summers ago. But of course we’re all fools, because his cricket brain is so staggeringly good he can bat any situation. The potential for him to destroy sides in all conditions is frightening.”Buttler is a rare one that Smyth and I got right. Even if it didn’t work, it would’ve been triable in the Hague to only have one go with someone so good. He’s got so much more experience of batting in pressurised situations now, and the calmness that comes with knowing you can do it. Well in Ed Smith for picking him. 45th over: England 169-6 (Moeen 21, Foakes 1) Foakes gets off the mark quickly with a crump to midwicket. “‘Heavens to Betsy,’” begins Kevin Ryan. “Yes a superb exclamation! I can just imagine The Dude and Walter saying that to each other and to the world in general instead of that other word which was apparently used 260 times in the movie. I shall contact the Coen Brothers right now.”I have previously inserted “the Merry wives of Windsor”, as in “what the Merry wives of Windsor is going on here”. I also find that “expletive” works well - I think, on reflection, that might be inspired by Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus. Finally Buttler, coming down, runs past one that’s leg side. Dickwella swipes off the bails in short order ... but we go upstairs ... and this time Sandakan contrived to keep his foot behind the line ...just. That’s an excellent innings from Buttler, who is very rapidly developing from genius into player. 44th over: England 168-5 (Buttler 64, Moeen 21) Watching this morning’s wickets again, I notice that when Jonny Bairstow went, there was no message to his castigators. I suppose if that sense of conflict helps his game then get stuck in, but it’s not really true, is it? He seems well-liked, and people want him to make the most of his talent, which he’s not been doing lately, and a ton at three in a dead rubber doesn’t prove anything to anyone. I’d love to see him make a go of it there, but I’m not sure his high backswing and propensity to get himself out when set will come over in England and against better attacks. Moeen sees out a maiden. Morning all and thanks Rob - the players are having a quick nip, and don’t Sri Lanka need one. England are away, and it’s very hard to see how they avoid a whitewash from here. They don’t look like taking a wicket, never mind five, and the current lead already looks like plenty. 42nd over: England 164-5 (Buttler 62, Moeen 19) Buttler has played with such authority in this innings. He came in when England were 39 for four and in danger of a good old-fashioned farce, yet he has breezed to 62 from 75 balls without a negative thought in the world.41st over: England 160-5 (Buttler 60, Moeen 17) It’s all very low-key at the moment. England have stealthily moved into a strong position, with a lead of 256 on a wearing pitch.40th over: England 157-5 (Buttler 59, Moeen 15) Buttler survives an optimistic LBW appeal after charging Perera. The ball straight sharply from around the wicket but there was too much guesswork for the umpire. It was probably bouncing over the top.39th over: England 155-5 (Buttler 58, Moeen 14) SrI Lanka are starting to look a little forlorn. Sandakan, who dismissed Ben Stokes twice with no-balls in the morning session, returns to the attack and is milked for three singles.38th over: England 152-5 (Buttler 56, Moeen 13) “If the batting side were given an extra DRS review every time the bowling side bowled a no ball, the captain of the bowling side would jolly quickly chivvy his chuckers into controlling their footwork properly?” sniffs Kim Thonger. “Wouldn’t work in village cricket of course, but making the side offending most buy all the post-match beer might.”37th over: England 149-5 (Buttler 54, Moeen 12) Since his recall Buttler is England’s leading runscorer, with 750 at an average of 47 and a strike rate of 68. Those are superb numbers, especially when you consider that most of the pitches have offered a bit to the bowlers.36th over: England 147-5 (Buttler 53, Moeen 11) Moeen edges Perera short of slip and away for four and then Buttler reaches a quietly brilliant half-century from 59 balls. It’s been a smart, assertive and fleet-footed performance.35th over: England 138-5 (Buttler 49, Moeen 6) Moeen has started watchfully. He’s such a dangerous player in a situation like this, because he could easily lace 70 from 90 balls. For now he is dealing in singles and has six from 13.34th over: England 135-5 (Buttler 48, Moeen 4) A good over from Perera, who has been by far Sri Lanka’s best bowler in this series.33rd over: England 132-5 (Buttler 47, Moeen 2) Moeen has had a poor series with the bat, averaging 11, though his bowling makes up for that.“There is indeed no excuse for a slow bowler to be called for no-balls, but it can be understood if you consider something similar in other sports,” says John Starbuck. “Tennis foot-faults, trying to cheat a few more yards at a football free-kick or throw-in, endless dodgy business in the rugby codes there’s something enticing about putting one over on the opposition and referee which appeals to certain sensibilities. It makes no difference at all in creating an advantage but still people do it.”Yes, good point. I suppose the difference in cricket if that you know you’ll be checked every time you take a wicket, so there is no way you can succeed. There’s no way!32nd over: England 128-5 (Buttler 45, Moeen 0) “Leo Nine surely speaks for the existential dread in us all as he returns wearily from his morning dip and contemplates an afternoon of bridge at the British Club in Bangkok - further compounded by his angst at the quality of the cricket coverage intruding amongst Sky’s normal betting programming (over 19),” says Brian Withington. “To be serious for a moment, the scourge of gambling and its advertising is little short of a national disgrace, but I don’t think we can entirely blame Sky’s owners for that (although on reflection I can feel an argument stirring). There was another piece in the  earlier about the subject but can’t find the link - author suggested that children should be taught about the perniciousness of bookies’ odds making in school. A worthy aspiration, but I’m not sure it would be any more effective than pointing out the perils of drink, drugs, fags and unprotected sex. If nothing else, I suggest we might at least ban the adverts that purport to tell us to stop gambling ‘when the fun stops’ - where hypocrisy meets tokenism and still turns a profit.”As with most of modern society’s soul-selling ills, it feels like it’s too late to do much about it. Stokes has gone this time. He danced down the track to Perera but didn’t get to the pitch and dragged the ball to long on, where Pushpakumara took a good low catch. Stokes was caught off Sandakan no-balls twice in the morning session this time Perera kept his foot behind the line.31st over: England 122-4 (Stokes 37, Buttler 45) Stokes reverse-sweeps Dhananjaya solidly for a couple. England’s lead is a very handy 218 and they are surely going to win this game.“The discussion of bugger led me down memory lane,” says Kim Thonger. “I used to work in New York and once exclaimed ‘oh bugger’ in rather a large meeting. The entire throng gazed upon me with a collective firmly raised eyebrow. I felt obliged to find an alternative thereafter. I settled on ‘heavens to Betsy’, acceptable in all corners of Manhattan, but not much use on a cricket pitch, far too flimsy. Apparently it’s a ‘minced oath’, a sub-group of euphemisms used to avoid swearing when expressing surprise or annoyance. I dare say the Aussies have trained themselves to use it now they are reformed genteel characters.”30th over: England 117-4 (Stokes 33, Buttler 44) Buttler sweeps Perera for a couple, scampering back for a bonus second run. There is more than one way to counter-attack, and England have put pressure on Sri Lanka with their running as much as their strokeplay. Buttler is such an impressive, resourceful cricketer, who tailors every innings to the conditions and match situation. A top-edged sweep lands safely and brings him two more runs later in the over.“Hi Rob,” says Thomas Hinton. “Always good to start the day with a bit of etymology to make up for an England wobble. Just to add to Danny Edmunds’ account (over 24), ‘Bulgarian’ was less to do with belonging to the Orthodox Church and more specifically about certain dualist heresies that were seen as related to Bogomilism, which originated in the Bulgarian Empire. Specifically, in Western Europe, the southern French folk who took up Catharism were sometimes called Bogomils or Bulgars. That might give us a plausible start date for the term ‘bugger’, since Catharism appears in France in the late 12thearly 13th century. Give it a few years to transfer in English and you might be looking at mid-13th century, maybe? Also, I’m not sure why the term would need to come into English through Dutch, even if this is what the OED claims. Large numbers of the clergy in England were English-French bilinguals until the late 14th century, as were up to a fifth of the general population, so it makes more sense that (like so many other words) it would have transferred straight across from the French ‘bougre’.”All this grown-up knowledge is making me feel thoroughly inadequate. I can name the England XI for the sixth Test of the 1989 Ashes if that’s any good.29th over: England 111-4 (Stokes 32, Buttler 39) Keaton Jennings fell to the first ball of the morning session and now Jos Buttler has been dropped off the first ball after lunch, a very sharp legside chance to Dickwella off the bowling off Dhananjaya. It would have been a brilliant catch.“Morning Rob,” says Ben Heywood. “It’s shedding it down here in Montenegro. Danny Edmunds may have uncovered the origin of the phrase ‘bugger all’, but for me its finest usage - after a fashion - will always be from the famous Hungarian film director of the 30s, Michael Curtiz. His English was so famously strangled that he once demanded that more ‘empty horses’ were brought onto set, and was fond of declaring that ‘next time I send a fool to get something, I send myself’. “Well, one day, while filming Charge of the Light Brigade, he lost his rag with Errol Flynn and David Niven, who were both winding him up about his frequent slips of the tongue. Famously, he raged: ‘You buggering people! You think I know bugger nothing! Well, let me tell you - I know bugger all!’. “He may not have been using the word bugger.”28th over: England 110-4 (Stokes 32, Buttler 38) That’s lunch. It can sometimes be difficult to stay awake on these overnight shifts but not when the cricket is as exciting as that. England lost four early wickets before Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler counter-attacked to add 71 in 14 overs. But they both had escapes. Buttler was given out LBW, only for the decision to be overturned on review, and Stokes was twice caught off no-balls from the wrist spinner Sandakan. The upshot is that England lead by 206 runs and are still on course for their biggest ever victory in a Test series in Asia. This is ridiculous. Sandakan produced a beauty to get Stokes caught at slip, but for the second time replays showed he had overstepped. That is desperate stuff.27th over: England 106-4 (Stokes 31, Buttler 36) Stokes’ batting form hasn’t been great since his return - his last century was against West Indies in 2017 - so these are useful runs. His place will never be under threat, but a big score would give him some peace of mind. 26th over: England 103-4 (Stokes 29, Buttler 35) Stokes turns Sandakan wide of leg slip for four to bring up the hundred. England have really gone after Sandakan, whose four overs have cost 32. That’s not good in a lowish-scoring game like this.“Hi Rob,” says Phil White. “Read a brilliant interview with Robin Smith yesterday in October’s Cricketer mag, and was delighted to learn that you’re ghosting his autobiography. Had no idea he’d has such problems post-retirement, great to read that he’s got his life back on track. Any idea when it will be out?”Yup, it will be out in June, just in time for me to shamelessly plug it at every opportunity during the World Cup and Ashes. 25th over: England 96-4 (Stokes 24, Buttler 33) Buttler gets a leading edge that loops over Dhananjaya’s head for two. It hasn’t always been convincing, but this counter-attack has pushed England’s lead to a healthy 192.“What is all this talk of apps and smartphones?” says Ian Copestake. “It’s 1972 after all.”24th over: England 92-4 (Stokes 23, Buttler 30) Stokes slaps Sandakan straight to cover, only for replays to show it was a no-ball. Dear me, that’s such shoddy cricket. Spinners bowling no-balls is right up there on the list of modern society’s ills. “Morning Rob,” says Danny Edmunds. “ “Bugger” is derived from Middle Dutch and in turn derived from the old French word for “heretic” which was “bougre”. That in turn comes from Medieval Latin “Bulgarus” (“bulgarian”) in particular meaning an inidual belonging to the Orthodox rather than the Latin church (as you know, the Ortodox and Latin churches split in 1054). By the 16th century “bugger” was being used in English to mean “sodomite”, due to the association of sodomy with heresy. “Bugger all” itself seems to come in to common use in the early 20th century, one source giving the first recorded use as 1945, another suggesting it is one of the panoply of swear words that comes out of the First World War.” And that is why I love the OBO.23rd over: England 87-4 (Stokes 21, Buttler 27) I thought Buttler was gone, that it would be umpire’s call at worst for Sri Lanka. But there is a lot more bounce in this pitch and that saved him.Jos Buttler is reprieved on review! He was given out LBW to a fine delivery from the new bowler Dhananjaya de Silva, but he went upstairs and replays showed it was bouncing over the top of middle stump.22nd over: England 85-4 (Stokes 20, Buttler 27) Majestic stuff from Buttler, who walks down the track to whack consecutive deliveries from Sandakan into the leg side for four. He was so quick on his feet that he turned both balls into low full tosses. This has been a terrific, cold-eyed counter-attack from Buttler, who has 27 from 24 balls.21st over: England 76-4 (Stokes 19, Buttler 19) Buttler has been very positive, using his feet at every opportunity to the spinners. This is great fun to watch, with both teams on the attack. This part have added 37 in seven overs.“At the risk of also being shamed for my first world privilege, I feel compelled to share some of Richard Smyth’s pain (over 12) at the way the App so frustratingly hides the contact details of its leading lights,” says Brian Withington. “Judging by your uncharacteristically tart reply, I can only assume that Richard must be your brother, however heavy he might be?”20th over: England 71-4 (Stokes 17, Buttler 16) The wrist spinner Lakshan Sandakan replaces Pushpakumara and starts with an eventful over. Stokes drags a sweep fine for four, is beaten by a jaffa and then reverse sweeps just over the man at slip. Buttler makes it 12 from the over with an emphatic drive past mid-off for four.“Just putting the finishing touches to a piece of writing set in 2035,” says Martin Wright. “Which leads me (by way of typical writer’s procrastination) to wonder if any of the current squad will still be playing for England then? Or if not, any current young blades on the county circuit?”I hope Haseeb Hameed will be closing in on 15,000 Test runs in 2035. Ollie Pope, Sam Curran and Dom Bess will be the age that Jimmy Anderson is now, so they could still be involved in this thing of ours.19th over: England 59-4 (Stokes 13, Buttler 9) Stokes belts Perera for his first boundary, and I’m happy to report that we have a picture once more.“Hello from Bangkok, where I’m back from my morning swim and off, shortly, for an afternoon”s bridge at the British Club...” says Leo Nine. I was in Galle for the first Test - great fun, of course, though I did wish for a closer match, which we might well now get in Colombo. I watched a little of this match on Sky at the pub yesterday evening and was very disappointed in what can only be described as Sky’s between-ads coverage. I had naturally wanted to see all the wickets that had fallen but they only showed a nano-montage of Rashid’s five-fer before returning to their mission of enticing us all to gamble more (no interest) using our smartphones (don’t have one). It occurred to me that this pathetically appalling presentation might be partly the reason why fewer and fewer people are following - or being drawn into - the game. Any comments from other readers?”That feels like a bit of a reach to me, though I’m no expert in the human condition. 18th over: England 52-4 (Stokes 7, Buttler 8) “Morning, Rob,” says John Starbuck. “No idea about ‘bugger all’ though ‘sod all’ is a similar phrase, but what about short leg? It’s become a really effective position in this series, so are there any stats about catchesrun-outs thence? How good do you have to be to become a specialist at any position in the field?”I’m sure there are unofficial stats but nothing that has troubled our friend Statsguru. I suspect you’d have to be inhumanly good to be a specialist fielder in any position.17th over: England 47-4 (Stokes 6, Buttler 5) We are having a few technical problems, in solidarity with the England batsmen.16th over: England 44-4 (Stokes 5, Buttler 3) England, who lead by 140, will want to set Sri Lanka a target of at least 250. The pitch is doing a bit for the spinners but it’s far from unplayable. 15th over: England 42-4 (Stokes 4, Buttler 2) That’s drinks. Sri Lanka would have been happy with two wickets in the first hour instead they took four, including the big one of Joe Root, and are back in the match. England lead by 138 runs.14th over: England 39-4 (Stokes 3, Buttler 0) It was another soft dismissal. Root tried to turn to leg and got a leading edge back towards the bowler, who swooped to his left to take an excellent low catch.“Love to wake up and have breakfast with OBO open,” says Jim Todd. “Tanzania is half way between UK and Sri Lanka, so 7:30 is an ideal start time. Interested in your use of the term ‘bugger all’. Where does the term come from, and why does it denote little or no activity (as in Chelsea’s corner yesterday)?”That’s a heck of a question. I love a bit of etymology at 5.30am on a Sunday. (Erm, I have no idea. Can anyone help?) England seem determined to ensure, one way or another, that we all get Tuesday off. Root has gone, caught off his bowling by Pushpakumara. I missed the dismissal due to a frozen screen but I’m sure we’ll see a replay in a second.13th over: England 36-3 (Root 5, Stokes 1) The new batsman is Ben Stokes, who has had problems with Perera in this series. Another quick wicket would put Sri Lanka right back in this game.“On the East cost of the USA, the start time is OK for some listening before bed,” says Mark Zip. “GuerillaCricket, of course, because it’s not geoblocked. Of course, it does mean that one sleeps through the last session of the day. Wish I’d heard yesterday’s last session.”Jonny Bairstow falls to a brilliant catch at short leg by the substitute Kaushal Silva. He flicked Perera firmly off the pads, and Silva somehow took a stunning reaction catch by his left shoulder. Perera has three wickets and England are in a bit of bother.12th over: England 33-2 (Bairstow 14, Root 5) Bairstow gets the first boundary of the day with a confident clip through midwicket off the new bowler Pushpakumara. After a slow start to the innings, England are now greedily gobbling up runs. It helps that Bairstow and Root run so well together. They lead by 129.“Morning, Rob!” says Richard Smyth. “Some of us are awake (with atrociously wakeful babies) and following the OBO - but there’s nowhere I can see on the app that tells me how to email you. I had to access via my browser, like a peasant.”The horrors of modern life never cease to appal. I heard a barbaric story the other day about a  writer who was forced to drink instant coffee.11th over: England 25-2 (Bairstow 8, Root 3) That’s a tame end to a promising debut series from Burns, who made 155 runs at 25.83. Joe Root, the new batsman, scampers singles off each of his first three deliveries. He’ll change the tempo of the innings.“Our boiler packed up yesterday,” says Sam Tudor, “so I volunteered to get up at 4.30am today to turn on the emergency fan heater. My wife thinks this time was the result of a complex calculation, taking into account the thermal mass of our house, the rating of the heater and her rising time of 8.30am. Still missed the wicket though.”Rory Burns has gone! He didn’t even bother to discuss a review with Jonny Bairstow. It was tossed up by Perera, and Burns simply missed a flick across the line. I know I said this about Jennings but Burns really was plumb.10th over: England 20-1 (Burns 7, Bairstow 6) Bairstow plays a couple of cracking drives without piercing the field. The ball is doing the square root of bugger all for Lakmal, who will surely take himself out of the attack sooner rather than later.“Just worried you were lonely,” says Jesse Linklater. “I’m here in snowy Montreal, following the OBO, trying not to drift off to sleep.”You’re reading the OBO and trying not to go to sleep? You’re aware of the principles of cause and effect, right? 9th over: England 16-1 (Burns 6, Bairstow 5) An unplayable delivery from Perera turns the wrong way and beats Bairstow outside off stump. He looks a real threat today. Bairstow has a flustered sweep at the next ball, misses and is hit on the pad. Chris Gaffaney rejects Sri Lanka’s LBW appeal and they don’t discuss a review. It looked pretty close, though it may have done too much.“Jennings was very good at getting his body in the way of the ball yesterday,” says Romeo. “He’s continued today.”Runs schmuns. In this brave new world of selection, there’s always room for a specialist short leg.8th over: England 12-1 (Burns 3, Bairstow 5) A maiden fae Lakmal to Bairstow.“There seems to be much surprise that Keaton Jennings is such a good fielder, yet it is in his genes,” says Kevin Thornton. “His father Ray, the Transvaal wicket-keeper of the apartheid era, was known as Jet Jennings because he was so quick behind the stumps he seemed rocket-propelled. Ray was a more than useful lower-order batter who was also not overly fond of the quick bowlers.”He wasn’t overly fond of anyone in those days, was he? But he was indeed a brilliant keeper.7th over: England 12-1 (Burns 3, Bairstow 5) Perera rips one past Bairstow and down the leg side for three byes. Sri Lanka know they need early wickets and have men round the bat. England might need to sit in for the first hour, though that doesn’t come naturally to Bairstow. The lead is 108.6th over: England 7-1 (Burns 2, Bairstow 4) The captain Suranga Lakmal starts at the other end to Bairstow, who gets a thick edge all along the ground for three. Burns defends the rest of the over.Anyone out there?5th over: England 4-1 (Burns 2, Bairstow 1) That Jennings LBW was nowhere near as plumb as I thought replays showed it was just hitting the outside of leg stump. Jennings ends a mixed series with 233 runs at an average of 47, 146 of which came in the second innings at Galle.Keaton Jennings falls to the first ball of the day! He played defensively outside the line at a good delivery from Perera which skidded on and kept low before hitting him on the pad. That looked plumb.Rory Burns and Keaton Jennings stroll out of the tunnel into the hot, hot heat of Colombo. Dilruwan Perera is going to open the bowling.Women’s World T20 England were, alas, well beaten by Australia in the final in Antigua. They never really recovered from a terrible 11-ball spell at the start of their innings in which Amy Jones was briliantly run out and Nat Sciver was trapped LBW by Ellyse Perry. Australia were just too good.Morning. Those of us who predicted a 3-0 whitewash before this series would be feeling pretty smug if we had only named the correct winning team. England were supposed to go the way of Australia and South Africa, who were hammered on turning pitches in Sri Lanka. Instead they are closing in on their biggest ever victory in the subcontinent. Their best is the famous 3-1 win in India in 1976-77, but a farce-free batting performance today should ensure the aforementioned whitewash.England will resume on three for none in their second innings, a lead of 99, after a dramatic final session in which the brilliance of Ben Stokes, Adil Rashid and Keaton Jennings induced a spectacular collapse - the kind of collapse, in fact, that we expected from England in these conditions.

It is claimed they include confidential emails between senior executives, and correspondence with Zuckerberg.Damian Collins, the chair of the culture, media and sport select committee, invoked a rare parliamentary mechanism to compel the founder of a US software company, Six4Three, to hand over the documents during a business trip to London. In another exceptional move, parliament sent a serjeant at arms to his hotel with a final warning and a two-hour deadline to comply with its order. When the software firm founder failed to do so, it’s understood he was escorted to parliament. He was told he risked fines and even imprisonment if he didn’t hand over the documents.“We are in uncharted territory,” said Collins, who also chairs an inquiry into fake news. “This is an unprecedented move but it’s an unprecedented situation. We’ve failed to get answers from Facebook and we believe the documents contain information of very high public interest.”The seizure is the latest move in a bitter battle between the British parliament and the social media giant. The struggle to hold Facebook to account has raised concerns about limits of British authority over international companies that now play a key role in the democratic process.Facebook, which has lost more than $100bn in value since March when the Observer exposed how Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from 87m US users, faces another potential PR crisis. It is believed the documents will lay out how user data decisions were made in the years before the Cambridge Analytica breach, including what Zuckerberg and senior executives knew.MPs leading the inquiry into fake news have repeatedly tried to summon Zuckerberg to explain the company’s actions. He has repeatedly refused. Collins said this reluctance to testify, plus misleading testimony from an executive at a hearing in February, had forced MPs to explore other options for gathering information about Facebook operations.“We have very serious questions for Facebook. It misled us about Russian involvement on the platform. And it has not answered our questions about who knew what, when with regards to the Cambridge Analytica scandal,” he said.“We have followed this court case in America and we believed these documents contained answers to some of the questions we have been seeking about the use of data, especially by external developers.”The documents seized were obtained during a legal discovery process by Six4Three. It took action against the social media giant after investing $250,000 in an app. Six4Three alleges the cache shows Facebook was not only aware of the implications of its privacy policy, but actively exploited them, intentionally creating andeffectively flagging up the loophole that Cambridge Analytica used to collect data. That raised the interest of Collins and his committee.A Facebook spokesperson said that Six4Three’s “claims have no merit, and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously”.The files are subject to an order of a Californian superior court, so cannot be shared or made public, at risk of being found in contempt of court. Because the MPs’ summons was issued in London where parliament has jurisdiction, it is understood the company founder, although a US citizen, had no choice but to comply. It is understood that Six4Three have informed both the court in California and Facebook’s lawyers.Facebook said: “The materials obtained by the DCMS committee are subject to a protective order of the San Mateo Superior Court restricting their disclosure. We have asked the DCMS committee to refrain from reviewing them and to return them to counsel or to Facebook. We have no further comment.”It is unclear what, if any, legal moves Facebook can make to prevent publication. UK, Canada, Ireland, Argentina, Brazil, Singapore and Latvia will all have representatives joining what looks set to be a high-stakes encounter between Facebook and politicians.Richard Allan, vice-president for policy who will testify at the special session after Zuckerberg declined to attend, said the company takes its responsibility around “a number of important issues around privacy, safety and democracy ... very seriously”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/963f97158841459e0e118bbfc7580690930096c3/0_128_3397_2038/master/3397.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeb75dff9a1c4d35d03c015f7e9969b1","title":"room for one more multimac four abreast multiple child car seat","story":"Perfect for large families or parents of twins and triplets, the Multimac is a unique, sanity-saving, multiple child seat system, which fits into the back of almost any carI sometimes used to imagine parenting was a sort of extreme endurance sport. Throw in a few years of sleep deprivation and simple tasks like ‘feeding the baby’ (a teaspoon of slop inserted into a bobbing head) soon become hellish. Among the hardest challenges you face is ‘getting the baby into the car’. My wife and I used to have a strict ‘who touched the baby last clips her in’ policy. Our problem was self-inflicted. We had three children and a small car. As car seats became safer they became larger, which meant it became harder to get the seats into cars and the kids into seats.Now, 20 years too late for us, but hopefully in time for you, comes the revolutionary Multimac. It’s the world’s only one-piece car seat that now allows you to travel with up to four children (from birth to age 12) in a single row across the rear of almost any car. Unusually the Multimac doesn’t use Isofix points, but has its own super secure straps. You can fit these yourself or pay a Multimac agent, such as Halfords, a £99 one-off fitting fee. The bench is quite heavy so once you’ve installed it you’ll probably leave it where it is, but it can be moved if need be.

Pictures such as this one, taken in the reconstructed drift mine at the Beamish open-air museum in County Durham, were part of a project he called Flogging a Dead Horse. There was anger in these photographs. They were intended, Reas said, to be a “bitter and ironic rebuke to those who were appropriating working-class history, with all its hardships, and making it into entertainment”.Fables of Faubus, a new book that includes four decades of Reas’s pictures of Britain, puts that rebuke into context. Reas grew up on the Buttershaw council estate in Bradford, made infamous by the film Rita, Sue and Bob Too. He was apprenticed as a bricklayer in the late 1970s before, inspired by the northern soul club scene and the excitement of seeing American documentary photography, he picked up a camera and headed to art college.The first subjects he was drawn to were working men, the characters he recognised from his years on building sites. In 1983, he produced a series of remarkable black-and-white portraits of miners in south Wales, not realising that within two years the world he had witnessed would be largely shut down and dismantled.Almost immediately, sanitised versions of that world were being reconstructed and sold as Sunday afternoon days out. The Big Pit National Coal Museum in south Wales, where Reas also photographed, opened as local collieries were being closed. The drift mine at Beamish, staffed partly by redundant miners, invited visitors to “experience the reality of life underground”. It was not a reality that Reas recognised, but his pictures capture that pivotal moment, when, in a few short years, two centuries of industry became history.Fables of Faubus by Paul Reas is published next month (Gost, £35)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17c9047adcdc6c4d6c96dac2048e72e360ebba1e/0_56_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=143f0907b1e988c2820548d69bf6466d","title":"share your experiences of christmas festivities overseas you could win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tell us how you spent Christmas on a trip to anywhere in the worldYou may have been to an inspiring Christmas concert, eaten local fare, taken part in unusual festivities in a far-off land – or spent the day on a remote tropical beach.Wherever you were in the world, please share your tales of a Christmas spent overseas.Please be specific about locations, and include prices and websites where appropriate.Read the terms and conditions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc9b90c27bc8b82b3ce81026356cd54e36639a3a/50_0_3401_2040/master/3401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=621553604a6e457b20db8b97de71b18d","title":"strictly come dancing week 10 live","story":"The seven remaining couples took part in a lindy hop challenge. Who will make it through to next week’s Musicals special? Thank you all for joining in and being excellent for another week – I’ll be back tomorrow at 7.20pm for the results, when we’ll send another Strictly couple home. Enjoy the rest of your Saturday, and I’ll see you then!Time for a recap! My fave this evening was definitely Faye and Giovanni’s Waltz, and Stacey and Kevin’s Paso. Can’t see how Graeme is going to survive this week – suspect he may be up against Charles and Karen in the dance off tomorrow, as the public will once again make up for Lauren and AJ’s undermarking. The Lindyhopathon made pretty much no difference to the scoreboard whatsoever, which makes that ten minutes of our lives we’re never getting back. The judges’ scoring is a hot mess but I THINK Lauren is in 7th, Graeme in 6th, Charles in 5th, Stacey in 4th, Joe in 3rd, Faye in 2nd and Ashley in first. As scoring goes, that was an absolute shambles. Someone in production is going to get a thorough telling-off from Shirley, and I do not envy them.And we’re off! There are seven couples on the dancefloor, so pretty tough to know what the hell is going on. Charles is doing the waggly finger though, so that’s worth a point. Graeme is mostly skipping about and is probably in line for one point. I can’t really tell for all the others, I’ve only got two eyes and one of them is already looking at a laptop.So the Lindy Hop is basically a swing dance that takes inspiration from the Charleston, with a bit of jazz and tap thrown in. I’m always hugely envious of people who are very good at it, it looks incredibly cool.So Faye and Stacey are at the top of the leaderboard, and Graeme is at the bottom. Pashley only in third this week, which is unexpected. But there are seven more points up for grabs now, so I’m fully expecting them to be back on top shortly.Time to drink your way through the Lindyhopathon!Scores: 9,10,10,10 - a total of 39 for Stacey and Kevin. Stacey falls to her knees and gives an oscar acceptance speech. To be fair, I would after three tens too. Craig though Kevin made Stacey look absolutely amazing. Darcey thought it was fierce, Stacey was eating up the dancefloor - it was dramatic, powerful and brilliant. Shirley thought Stacey looked like a star, and Bruno thought she captured the purity of style, and it was fantastically choreographed. Ooh, Stacey looks absolutely smoking. Love the attitude in this Paso, with bags of drive and power. Stacey looks right at home in this dance, and it’s an outstanding performance, if not the most traditional Paso. Really enjoyed that, I held my breath from start to finish.And finally, it’s STACEY AND KEVIN! This week they’re dancing the Paso Doble to ‘Malaguena’ by Brian Setzer. This is another song that’s on its fifth outing, last seen in Blackpool with Anita and Gleb.It is, however, proper Paso music, with an uber-masc stompy section in the middle that I’m sure Kevin will take full advantage of. Scores: 5,6,6,6 - a total of 23 for Lauren and AJ. Bit mean, judges. Darcey thought it was not bad, but Lauren’s feet were a bit messy in places. Shirley agrees that her feet and legs didn’t have enough grounding, but she liked the intricate arm work. Bruno thought it was a difficult routine, but Lauren needs to give it more welly and sell it with every part of her body. Craig thought it was rather lacklustre, and Lauren’s foot placement was haphazard.

With the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, threatening to veto May’s deal at Sunday’s leaders’ summit in Brussels, the British government was forced to publicly concede on Saturday that Gibraltar will not necessarily be covered by a future trade deal.Sánchez immediately claimed that he would use the concession to force the British to open talks on joint sovereignty of Gibraltar, over which Spain has had a claim since the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.He said: “Once the UK has left the EU, Gibraltar’s political, legal and even geographic relationship with the EU will go through Spain …“Spain will be a fundamental pillar of the relationship between Gibraltar and the EU as a whole.“When it comes to the future political declaration, the European council and the European Commission have backed Spain’s position, and backed it as never before.“In these fundamental future negotiations, we’re going to have to talk about joint sovereignty and many other things with the UK.”Madrid has always insisted that Gibraltar should be covered by agreements struck between the EU and the UK only with Spain’s consent. The Spanish government was furious when an article in the withdrawal agreement appeared to suggest that any future trade deal would also cover the disputed territory.Downing Street was accused of “acting under the cover of darkness” in inserting the clause, known as article 184. Sánchez had warned that he would snub Sunday’s Brexit summit unless he had written and public assurances from Downing Street that Spain would have a crucial say in Gibraltar’s future.That reassurance came on Saturday in the form of a letter from the British ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, laying out the British government’s acceptance that the withdrawal agreement “imposes no obligations regarding the territorial scope” of a future trade deal.“She believes that even the worst deal is acceptable. It isn’t.”Clare Moody, Labour’s MEP for Gibraltar, said: “What is remarkable is that Theresa May has gone to Brussels to concede further text at this stage, before we’ve even left.“The only way to maintain Gibraltar’s status is for the UK to remain in the EU – that is why we need a ‘people’s vote’.”Amid a growing outcry over the government’s concession, the prime minister insisted that nothing had changed over the UK’s territorial claim to Gibraltar. She also dismissed claims from Spain’s foreign minister that the agreement on the Rock had been a victory for Madrid, delivering a treaty that was “the most important one since the Utrecht Treaty of 1713”, that handed the territory to the British.Theresa May said: “The UK’s position on the sovereignty of Gibraltar has never changed and will not change.“I’m proud that Gibraltar is British and I will always stand by Gibraltar.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01059ae650c3051b0bf206677c37d776cd4b0907/252_523_983_590/master/983.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=783a9b9e9aaad87024bf0f327a9fe927","title":"jamal khashoggi omar abdulaziz dissident saudis interview","story":"For Omar Abdulaziz, a 27-year-old Saudi dissident living in exile in Canada, the murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi was more than a prominent columnist and veteran who knew the ins and outs of the Saudi royal court. He was a mentor and father figure.Abdulaziz, who often lambasts the Saudi leadership and the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in online videos that garner a huge following, cannot see his parents, who still live in the kingdom. Khashoggi was also forced to live abroad, without his children.So when Abdulaziz learned of the journalist’s fate – his brutal killing in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul – he broke down. But he now takes solace in what Khashoggi has achieved in death.“The idiots wanted to silence his voice,” he says. “But they made way for a thousand other voices.”It is now nearly two months since Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, disappeared inside the consulate. Turkish prosecutors say he was attacked on entering the building and strangled, his body dismembered and destroyed. His corpse has not been found, but Turkish officials identified more than a dozen Saudi operatives who travelled to Istanbul and allegedly took part in a premeditated assassination.Saudi officials have acknowledged the killing, and have said they will pursue the death penalty for five suspects charged with ordering and carrying it out. But they insist it was the work of a rogue cell that went beyond instructions to bring back Saudi dissidents from around the world. Some of the suspects, and top intelligence officials who were ousted in the aftermath, are close to the crown prince, but officials insist that he had no knowledge of the operation. The CIA believes otherwise, however, reportedly concluding that Prince Mohammed ordered the assassination.The murder has sparked global outrage and damaged the reputation of a leader who had billed himself as a reformer eager to modernise Saudi society but has cracked down on activists and opponents at home. The killing was particularly disturbing to Abdulaziz because, aside from his personal grief, there were chilling parallels with his own life.In May this year, two Saudi officials met him in Montreal, bringing along his brother, and urged him to work with the authorities. In the conversations, which Abdulaziz recorded, the officials invited him to renew his passport at the Saudi consulate. When he went back and listened to them after Khashoggi’s murder, he was stunned.He declined the offer, but a month later his phone was hacked, and his conversations with Khashoggi were intercepted. They concerned an “army of bees” project to recruit volunteers to counter Saudi state disinformation and propaganda on social media. The hacking was confirmed by the Citizen Lab, an outfit at the University of Toronto that studies digital espionage.For now, Abdulaziz and other activists are mourning Khashoggi’s death. But he says they do not feel frightened. The journalist’s killing has refocused attention on human rights abuses in the kingdom, the disastrous war in Yemen and the parallel intolerance of any form of dissent.He is particularly concerned about those detained at home, including his two brothers and several friends who are imprisoned for their links to him. “If they did this to Jamal Khashoggi, how do they deal with the others?” he asks.Abdulaziz applied for asylum in 2014, when his student scholarship was cancelled after he criticised the Saudi government. He initially criticised Khashoggi also, for refusing to invite Saudi dissidents on to a TV station that he launched in 2015.But Abdulaziz was one of the first activists to back Khashoggi when the older man left the kingdom to live in exile in 2017. They began working together on various initiatives.Abdulaziz recognised Khashoggi’s potential as a figure that the “silent majority” would listen to. The Saudi journalist did not refer to himself as a dissident, nor did he wish for the overthrow of the monarchy, but instead sought a moderate middle ground between loyalism and opposition, one that Abdulaziz said was desperately needed in the discourse surrounding the oil-rich kingdom.More frightening to the government, Abdulaziz says, was Khashoggi’s attempt to create institutions and do civil society work abroad.“Yes, the Washington Post columns were frightening,” he says. “It’s like Mohammed bin Salman writing on a blackboard and Jamal Khashoggi would erase it in the night, with one column.”“The government realised this man was transforming the work abroad into institutional work, and that’s what was missing from the Saudi opposition. There is no civil society.”Riyadh’s shifting narrative of what happened to Khashoggi has hurt its credibility, Abdulaziz says, prompting more people to seek out other voices.“Today Saudi activists are stronger, and their voices are heard,” he says. “I think now, the silent majority believes in what we say, and thinks the regime is lying. The mask has fallen and the ugly, murderous, thuggish, cowardly image has been shown.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a31c4abb69d8db27f672d5fd4ebdaa9721363935/0_238_4642_2786/master/4642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6508151fbe8ec4d3d941cdeafc5db042","title":"democratic republic of congo presidential race opens","story":"The opposition in the DRC is fractured and two of its leading figures have been barred from standingCampaigning will start in earnest this week for the much-delayed presidential election in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Observers hope the polls will bring the DRC’s first democratic transfer of power, but many fear further destabilisation and conflict in an already unstable region.President Joseph Kabila, who has ruled since his father’s assassination in 2001, is backing his former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary against an opposition that is weakened both by disunity and the government’s moves to prevent key candidates from standing.Observers describe Shadary as a political nonentity who will be easily manipulated by Kabila. “We are sure we will win, by what margin is up to the people,” Lambert Mende, the information minister, said. “It is enough to look at our adversaries to understand we will win for sure.”Kabila had strongly resisted efforts to make him stand down but came under concerted pressure from Angola and South Africa, concerned by the prospect of further conflict in the resource-rich country.Arrangements for the election on 23 December are highly controversial. There is deep concern about new electronic voting machines, which critics say are more vulnerable to rigging than paper and ink and could be compromised by an erratic power supply. In addition, two of the biggest names among the opposition have been unable to stand.Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former warlord and vice-president who returned to the DRC in August after being acquitted of war crimes by the international criminal court, has been ruled out on legal grounds, while Moïse Katumbi, a wealthy businessman and former governor of Katanga province, has been stopped from returning home. He faces court cases in the DRC on charges that he says are trumped up and has been in exile in Europe for more than two years.An agreement among leading opposition politicians to collectively back the widely respected parliamentarian Martin Fayulu to face Shadary fell apart within 24 hours. But on Friday Félix Tshisekedi, leader of the biggest opposition party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, announced he would stand with Vital Kamerhe, a second significant opposition leader, as his running mate.“The Congolese political class has demonstrated its venality, betraying a population that has repeatedly pushed for its right to elect a new president in a free and fair process,” Stephanie Wolters, an expert at the Institute for Security Studies in Johannesburg, wrote last week.Kabila took over from his father, Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who was assassinated by a bodyguard in 2001. He remained in power despite his second term ending in 2016, under a constitutional clause that enables a president to stay in office until a successor is elected.“Kabila was not a strong man. He has to balance elite interests. There was no elite consensus on who might replace him and there still isn’t,” said Alex Vines, head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, a thinktank in London.Many provinces are in the grip of armed conflict and millions have had to flee from their homes. Officials in the DRC claim only 230,000 people have been displaced, which is a fraction of the UN’s estimate of 4.5 million.There has also been the country’s worst outbreak of Ebola. In an update published last week, the World Health Organisation reported 36 new confirmed cases. Officials have so far recorded 346 confirmed cases, including 175 deaths.The fight against the outbreak has been plagued by security problems, with health workers attacked by rebels in districts around the town of Beni where the virus has been spreading. This month, Ebola containment operations were paused after seven UN peacekeepers and 12 Congolese soldiers were killed in clashes with one of the many militias operating in the east of the country, but all activities have resumed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/757d0598af5b76afa9ebc525b7ed4cf52ef1f585/0_116_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2d143a5df96f121a6b8c697fbe774cd","title":"mummified woman dating back 3000 years unveiled in egypt","story":"Mummy found inside sarcophagus in Luxor tombs that also contained statues and figurinesA well-preserved mummy of a woman inside a previously unopened coffin dating back more than 3,000 years has been unveiled in the southern Egyptian city of Luxor.The sarcophagus was one of two found earlier this month by a French-led mission in the Al-Assasif necropolis on the western bank of the Nile. The first one had been opened earlier and examined by officials, but Saturday’s unveiling was the first time authorities had opened a previously unopened sarcophagus before international media.One of the two contained the “well-preserved” mummified remains of a woman named Thuya, the antiquities ministry said in a statement, but ministry spokeswoman Nevine Aref later said work was continuing to definitively identify the name of the mummy.“One sarcophagus was rishi-style, which dates back to the 17th dynasty, while the other sarcophagus was from the 18th dynasty,” the minister of antiquities, Khaled al-Anani, said. “The two tombs were present with their mummies inside.”The 18th dynasty dates back to the 13th century BC, a period noted for some of the most well-known pharaohs, including Tutankhamun and Ramses II.Located between the royal tombs at the Valley of the Queens and the Valley of the Kings, the Al-Assasif necropolis is the burial site of nobles and senior officials close to the pharaohs.Among the finds in the tomb were sarcophagi, statues and some 1,000 funerary figurines called ushabtis, made of wood, faience and clay.The tomb belonged to Thaw-Irkhet-If, the mummification supervisor at the Temple of Mut in Karnak, according to the ministry. The tomb, which also contains mummies, skeletons and skulls, dates back to the middle kingdom – almost 4,000 years ago – but was reused during the late period.Rubble 300m deep was removed over five months to uncover the tomb, which contained coloured ceiling with paintings depicting the owner and his family.Egypt has revealed over a dozen ancient discoveries since the beginning of this year. The country hopes these discoveries will brighten its image abroad and revive interest among travellers who once flocked to its famed pharaonic temples and pyramids, but who have shunned the country since its 2011 political uprising.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a561dc4f5b48bbe3736d391442a0a20d47aa6e48/20_115_3930_2358/master/3930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99fe1a3a28353b1ba1afff617681a7c8","title":"swiss voters take the cow by the horns referendum armin capaul","story":"Farmer Armin Capaul’s long campaign to keep animals intact makes it onto a referendum ballotWith his woolly hat, straggly grey beard and unswerving passion for the wellbeing of his cows, it’s no wonder Armin Capaul has become a media sensation. And the Swiss farmer has used the limelight to his advantage.After eight years of campaigning for farmers to be paid to keep the horns of their cattle intact, the issue will be settled in a referendum today.“I never dreamed I’d be sitting here,” Capaul, 67, said at the launch of his referendum campaign last month. “I only wanted to give the cows and goats a voice … If the cows could choose, they’d have horns.”Contrary to Swiss tourist board images of horned cows roaming idyllic mountain pastures, up to two thirds of cows in Switzerland are hornless. While most dairy cow breeds are born with horns, it’s widespread practice to remove them at a few weeks old using a heated iron.Hornless animals are easier and cheaper to keep as they don’t have to be tethered in inidual pens to avoid accidents. But Capaul argues that it’s cruel to deprive the animals of their horns, which he says they use to communicate, stay cool and clean themselves. He wants farmers to be granted subsidies to cover the costs associated with keeping the horns.“The horn is a heavily perfused, life-long growing organ,” it says on the website of the cow horn initiative, which Capaul founded. “It is linked to the digestive system, important for body care, and serves to communicate among other cows. Cows and goats wear their horns with pride and mindfulness. They clarify, for example, the hierarchy at a distance, by showing each other their horns.”Capaul, who lives on his farm on the border of Jura and Bern in western Switzerland, first wrote to the authorities asking for a subsidy in 2010. He received no reply.So he started his own people’s initiative. Under Swiss direct democracy, a group of citizens can force a referendum on an issue if they collect 100,000 supporting signatures within 18 months. Politicians scorned Capaul at first but the media quickly fell in love with the oddball farmer.Since then, Capaul’s long-running campaign has been the subject of thousands of news reports in Switzerland and has been picked up by foreign media across the world. His battle has inspired documentaries and books. And now, at last, his moment has come. “I’m here thanks to the media,” Capaul said at the campaign launch. “They were so enthusiastic.”But not everyone is so enthused. Both the Swiss parliament and the federal council have spoken out against the initiative, which could cost the state an estimated 10m-30mSwiss francs (£8m-£24m) in subsidies.Capaul’s most vocal critic is Johann Schneider-Ammann, the minister responsible for agricultural policy. He denies animals suffer from horn removal and suggests keeping them could do animals more harm than good if they have to be tethered rather than free to roam.“The initiative would be an own goal in terms of animal welfare. It might sound nice, but it would have negative consequences for the animals and for the farmers,” he told SRF, the Swiss state broadcaster."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taoiseach confident Europe will give Brexit withdrawal agreement green-lightFemale driver of second car and male front-seat passenger both sustain minor injuriesNumbers applying for Irish documents in wake of Brexit vote continue to increaseTravel, border controls and pension rights are becoming a real worryA total of 140 babies underwent therapeutic hypothermia treatment over two yearsEx-foreign secretary tells DUP conference North would be \u0026lsquoeconomic semi-colony of EU\u0026rsquoFoster also issues abject apology over \u0026lsquocash for ash\u0026rsquo scheme , saying lessons will be learnedIrish Rail says trains to depart Heuston and other terminus stations as soon as possibleSiblings recall trial at which their sister\u0026rsquos husband Eamonn Lillis was found guilty of manslaughterDUP MP: Brussels and Dublin must do more to \u0026lsquoexplore\u0026rsquo alternatives to avoid hard borderBoy to be sentenced next year for attempting to murder woman in Dun LaoghaireDodds says DUP \u0026lsquowill be tried and tested like never before\u0026rsquo over Brexit in coming daysFlights resume after temporary suspension on Saturday morning\u0026lsquoViolence against women and girls is one of the most widespread, persistent and devastating human rights violations in our world\u0026rsquoDrumlish native Danny McGee was found unresponsive outside bar in QueensLegal observers believe we can now weigh up the right of defendants to a fair trialNew rules seeking to ensure only bona-fide journalists and lawyers may report or tweet from court cases will come into effect on MondayRegulating short-term lets expected to be \u0026lsquologistically very difficult\u0026rsquo says head of planningSeveral in the organisation who had sex abuse complaints made against them are in prison\u0026lsquoFarmers ready to roll up their sleeves on climate action\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709671.1543084974!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no surrender on dup s adamant opposition to withdrawal agreement","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds on stage at the DUP annual party conference in Belfast on Saturday. Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReuters“Bin the backstop,” said Nigel Dodds. “Junk the backstop,” said Boris Johnson.That in a nutshell was what the DUP’s annual conference was about in relation to Brexit. Arlene Foster and her senior MPs may have been assailed by business and farmer leaders for more than a week, but not an inch was conceded there was no surrender on the DUP’s adamant opposition to the withdrawal agreement.Chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond tried his best to change minds at the DUP private dinner on Friday night, as did international trade secretary Liam Fox when he visited Newry on Friday.But no ground was conceded, and there never was going to be. Instead, it was left to former cabinet minister Boris Johnson to excite the delegates with his talk of that “throbbing, enigmatic, humming thing”.And to avoid any confusion over this phallic metaphor, this was in fact a reference to (Star Wars character) Obi Wan Kenobi’s light sabre, first made in Johnson’s Uxbridge constituency, as he told us.And its relevance? Well, it was pointing to the greatness of the United Kingdom as it prepares to leave the EU and its “most dynamic creative culture and media industries”.He was a good warm-up act for Foster. The delegates enjoyed it as he shifted metaphor by warning the withdrawal agreement would make the UK a “satellite” state, as opposed to a “vassal” state – the favoured description of last week.It was the same message from Nigel Dodds and from MEP Diane Dodds, who with Brexit wants to do herself out of a job as soon as possible.Diane Dodds displayed considerable chutzpah by quoting Seamus Heaney when anticipating the great day when the UK exits the European Union: “We must believe a further shore is reachable from here.”Now there’s a quote that will infuriate the Remain arts lobby.Arlene Foster, in a conciliatory nod to the South of the Border, said the DUP did not “want barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and our neighbours in the Republic”.On the other hand, Nigel Dodds, in an apparent reference to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, complained about “those in other jurisdictions trying to play up their republican credentials in advance of a forthcoming general election”.What was most arresting was the abject nature of Foster’s apology over the calamitous Renewable Heat Incentive scheme. As leader of the party she personally apologised and said “as a party we are deeply, deeply sorry”.She didn’t spare Ian Paisley jnr, who was at the conference after his recent return from suspension over taking expensive family holidays to Sri Lanka – the bill footed by the Sri Lankan government.In an implicit reference to the North Antrim MP and perhaps others, she said over the past 12 months “there have been a number of other areas where behaviour in our ranks has not matched the standards expected of people holding public office”.Those were the main themes of her speech, opposing the Brexit deal and displaying sackcloth and ashes over cash and ash.A lesser theme was that of restoring Stormont. Perhaps too much shouldn’t be read into it, but there was a possible hint of how the DUP might seek to get politics back working – when and if this whole Brexit mess is half sorted.It was interesting that on Thursday, Peter Robinson effectively advised unionists not to get hung up on an Irish language Act – the main issue that wrecked the prospects of reinstating the Northern Executive and Assembly early this year.Foster did not follow his lead but she did say that a “Cultural Deal” was needed “for everyone in Northern Ireland that respects difference and fosters understanding”.“It is in unionism’s interests for those from all backgrounds to feel comfortable in a Northern Ireland at peace with itself,” she added.Maybe there is something there to work on?Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Bertrand GuayAFPGetty ImagesShouts of “Macron resign!” and “Macron get lost!” punctuated the booms from tear gas and water cannons on the Champs-Élysées on Saturday, as French police forced protesters from the “Yellow Vests” movement away from the presidential offices in the Élysée Palace.Welling up rapidly from rural and forgotten France, this broad-based, citizen-driven movement is among the most serious challenges yet to President Emmanuel Macron’s pro-business government, say analysts, political opponents and even many of Macron’s supporters.On Saturday, thousands of the “gilets jaunes”, or Yellow Vests, named for the fluorescent road-safety vests that all French drivers must carry in their vehicles, converged on Paris for a second weekend to protest a rise in fuel taxes and to express general discontent with the fiscal burden in one of the most highly taxed states in Europe, where taxes represent over 45 percent of GDP.The numbers had dropped sharply from the preceding week’s several hundred thousand protesters police estimated there were about 8,000 in Paris and more than 80,000 across the country on Saturday.Clouds of gas and smoke rolled up the Champs-Élysées all afternoon as police battled militant members of the crowd wielding paving stones the grassroots protesters insisted they were unconnected with their movement.“We’re just fed up. It seems like to us that the government is only working to maintain its own privileges,” said Mathieu Styrna, one of the thousands marching. A contractor, he said he had been forced to drive hundreds of miles a week for work and could no longer afford his gas bills.It is the movement’s amorphousness that makes it new, powerful and potentially dangerous for Macron, analysts say. “The government parties didn’t understand that their tax policies would wind up producing this,” said Dominique Reynie, a political scientist at Sciences Po, saying the tax burden had grown by about €25 billion every year between 2002 and 2017.No high-ranking official has met with any of the self-designated spokespeople for the movement who have been appearing on French television all week. There have been a few small fiscal gestures – promises of checks and rebates – but these were dismissed by Saturday’s protesters as irrelevant to their daily struggle.“It’s going to trigger a civil war and me, like most other citizens, we’re all ready,” said Benjamin Vrignaud, a 21-year-old protester from Chartres.Mr Macron has insisted that the fuel tax rises are a necessary pain to reduce France’s dependence on fossil fuels and fund renewable energy investments, which is a cornerstone of his reforms of the nation. He will defend fresh plans to make the “energy transition” easier on Tuesday.A man caused a dramatic stand-off with police on Friday when he donned a neon vest and brandished an apparent grenade at a supermarket in the western city of Angers.

Photograph:  Michele Eve SandbergAFPGetty More than two weeks after the US midterm elections, a final result has yet to emerge as a handful of House races remain to be counted.But as Americans digest the results this Thanksgiving weekend, there is plenty of food for thought as the country looks ahead to 2020.While the election may have presented a split picture and a somewhat gloomy reflection on the polarisation that has become entrenched in American society, it was a good day for democracy. More people voted in the midterm elections than any non-presidential election since 1914. \u0026nbspA total of 49.2 per cent of eligible voters cast their ballot – this compares to a turnout of 36.4 per cent in the midterms of 2014. Though still low by international standards, this uptick in political participation is a positive sign.Most of this surge in voter engagement reflected a higher turnout by Democratic voters. In the House of Representatives race – where they flipped at least 39 seats – the Democrats outpaced Republicans significantly. More than 60 million people voted for Democrats in the House race. This compares to about 45 million for Republicans in 2010 when the party wrested control of the House of Representatives following a backlash against Obamacare. The level of support achieved by the Democrats is impressive – particularly as it is close to the 63 million votes Donald Trump received in the 2016 presidential election.But while the Democrats surged ahead in the popular vote once again, that did not necessarily translate into electoral wins.Democrats won reliably Democratic seats by large margins, though they failed to win House seats in conservative states such as Idaho or Montana for example. Democratic gains in Republican-leaning suburbs around the country were significant, however, and a real concern for Republicans going into 2020.On the Senate side, the picture was equally skewed – Democratic candidates garnered 12 million more votes than Republicans in Senate races though the party still managed to lose some seats. The apparent discrepancy again puts the spotlight on the Senate electoral process. Republicans continue to benefit from a structural advantage that the Senate system gives to conservative-leaning rural states. Under America’s electoral system, each of the 50 states gets two senators, regardless of population. Consequently, California, with a population of more than 40 million, has the same representation in the Senate as Wyoming, with a population of just over half a million.While defenders of the system argue that the Senate was never supposed to truly represent the popular vote, but rather give a voice to states, the political hue of the Senate has implications far beyond parliamentary democracy.In particular, the Senate plays a direct role in electing judges to the supreme court and to federal courts, a system that has resulted in a more conservative-leaning supreme court than the political dispensation of the population as a whole as indicated by the popular vote.While there appears to be little appetite within the US to change the system, Democrats have long taken solace from demographic changes which are expected to help their party in the long term.Population shifts and the increasing ersification of American society suggest that the political map is changing in their favour. The Democrats may not have been able to break the “red wall” of vast swathes of Republican-leaning rural America, but they are already making inroads into once reliably Republican states such as Arizona, Nevada and even Texas as the population of those states becomes more erse.This month’s election also delivered positive outcomes for Democrats looking to address the problem of voter representation. Several states included on their ballots proposals to change local election law. Voters in Michigan, for example, voted by two to one to loosen voter requirements, including moves to allow same-day voter registration, the expansion of absentee voting and the reintroduction of “straight” party voting, which allows voters to vote for one party for all positions by just checking one box – a long-standing process in Michigan that was abolished by the Republican-led legislature in 2015.In Florida, voters backed an amendment to allow felons to vote, with some exceptions – a move that will restore voting rights to more than one million people.In an election that was also notable for unsubstantiated allegations by President Donald Trump of voter fraud, moves to ensure that all US citizens who are entitled to vote can do so are a welcome development. Whether it will help the Democrats electorally will be a central question for the party as it heads into the next election cycle. \u0026nbspDemocrats take back the House.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

2017 | Terror attacks in the UK“We are also ensuring technology companies play their part by stopping terrorists from exploiting their platforms,” he said.In its report yesterday on the terrorist attacks, the ISC revealed an MI5 assessment showed “almost all attack planners downloaded, shared or consumed radical and extremist media of some kind.”Salman Abedi, the Manchester Arena bomber who killed 22 people including children, had also been able to manufacture his improvised explosive devices from online videos.“Action that affects their profits hits home harder than any sense of ‘doing the right thing’, and it is this that the Government should focus its efforts on.The committee highlighted cases where tech firms had refused to remove extremist content or co-operate despite Government requests, often citing the right of their customers to privacy as “trumping other considerations.”In one, an unnamed tech firm claimed the “violent and disturbing images” linked back to an academic site and to remove it “would compromise the quality of analysis the site owner provides.” Another refused to take down the website of a banned terrorist group.WhatsApp cited its “end to end encryption” for not revealing to police the final messages of  Westminster attacker Khalid Masood who stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death.The committee said it had been among the first to castigate the social media firms for failing to be more proactive in hunting down and removing extremist material rather than relying on users, organisations or police to alert them to it.But that was, four years ago after the terrorist murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.Although the firms have hired more moderators to assess material, the committee was frustrated that they continued in many cases to be used as a “safe haven” for extremists and terrorists.Searching the internet for “how to make a bomb” returned almost 2m results and a search for “beheading video” returned 250,000 hits in a study five years ago - and it was likely to have increased since.Although the tech firms were developing algorithms to track down terrorist material and alert police to it, the MPs said: “It is disappointing that - despite a great deal of engagement - little tangible progress has been made in the four years...and the scale of the challenge remains significant.”The criticism was backed last night by Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee, who this week wrote to Twitter, demanding to know why extremist material from a proscribed far right group was still available on its site.“It is frankly outrageous that these internet giants continue to profit off dangerous content, which we know can have fatal consequences,” she told The Daily .“These companies have been asked repeatedly to develop better systems to remove illegal material and have failed to do so. It is not good enough.”“Given the vast scale of this content, law enforcement and intelligence agencies are simply not equipped to tackle this issue alone.

The first one had been opened earlier and examined by Egyptian antiquities officials.One sarcophagus was rishi-style, which dates back to the 17th dynasty, while the other sarcophagus was from the 18th dynasty, Minister of Antiquities Khaled Al Anani said. The two tombs were present with their mummies inside.It is the first known time Egyptian archaeologists have opened a previously sealed sarcophagus in front of the international mediaThe Eighteenth Dynasty dates back to the 13th century BC, a period noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs, including Tutankhamen and Ramses II.It was the first known time that authorities had opened a previously unopened sarcophagus before international media.The two sarcophagi were found at the El-Asasef necropolis on the west bank of the NileEarlier in the day, authorities also revealed in the same area the tomb of the overseer of the mummification shrine identified as Thaw-Irkhet-if.The tomb contained five coloured masks and some 1,000 Ushabti statutes - the miniature figurine of servants to serve the dead in the afterlife.Egyptian officials hope the discovery of the new tombs may help attract back visitors deterred from visiting by the unrest of recent yearsThree-hundred metres of rubble were removed over five months to uncover the tomb, which contained coloured ceiling paintings depicting the owner and his family.The tomb, which also contains mummies, skeletons and skulls, dates back to the middle-kingdom almost 4,000 years ago, but was reused during the late period.The El-Asasef necropolis is the burial site of nobles and senior officials close to the pharaohsAncient Egyptians mummified humans to preserve their bodies for the afterlife, while animal mummies were used as religious offerings.Egypt has revealed over a dozen ancient discoveries since the beginning of this year.The country hopes these discoveries will brighten its image abroad and revive interest among travellers who once flocked to its iconic pharaonic temples and pyramids but who have shunned the country since its 2011 political uprising. Brexit latest news: Special EU summit held to finalise Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal - live updatesDozens of \u0026#39innocent\u0026#39 dogs being destroyed under Dangerous Dogs Act, new figures show Vincent Van Gogh statue in Brixton will not feature pipe, gun or razor bladeNotting Hill Bookshop is inundated with requests as location for marriage proposals ahead of film\u0026#39s 20th anniversaryComment: In defence of Jacob Rees-Mogg and his Brexit Dad\u0026#39s ArmyComment: 20mph zones aren\u0026#39t really about making roads safer – they\u0026#39re about stopping people driving altogetherBrighton homeowners could face prosecution if they fail to remove graffiti from their property Brexit latest news: Britain accused of caving in over Gibraltar - live updatesPony charity backed by Duchess of Cornwall dumps auction over crueltyComment: Let\u0026#39s get to the root cause of the Grenfell tragedyInside North Korea: How Kim Jong-un is carefully crafting a personality cult to keep grip on powerComment: Forget the naysayers, there\u0026#39s nothing quite like the joy of cold, hard cash Indian police map area of island where US man was killed by tribeZimbabwe\u0026#39s Robert Mugabe unable to walk, seeking treatment in SingaporeCutting EU migration could cost Scotland £2billion, according to Government Mexico\u0026#39s new government agrees to Trump\u0026#39s \u0026#39asylum waiting room\u0026#39 planMurder detectives hunt man after woman found stabbed to death in St Helens homeHurlingham Club poker night for 15-year-olds branded \u0026#39staggeringly ill-conceived\u0026#39 by anti gambling campaignAdders to be given new protected habitat as conservationists admit battle to overturn image problemWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 24 november 2018","story":"Aston the bull with his owner Sabine Rouas,43.

Nobody has the right to do that to them.I\u0027ve never seen anything like it. Usually people put very small children on them, but this man just threw his son on.Thames Valley Police said it was not called to the auction house. The society\u0027s president Jill Jones said complaints from members about travellers had reached an unprecedented level.She said: It has been happening over a four-year cycle and we have had an unprecedented number of complaints from members.We have to make a decision whether to ignore it and we can\u0027t, we are a charity.Duchess of Cornwall with Chas Hodges and Dave Peacock Speaking to Horse and Hound, Ms Jones added she did not blame the auction house for the alleged mistreatment.She told the magazine: The auctioneers are in the ring working hard to get the best prices for the ponies and they can’t often be outside to see what goes on. There is a distinct lack of supervision as well as a contingent of people who cannot be controlled”.However, another council member, who also wished to remain anonymous, defended travellers and insisted they were not to completely at fault. He said: Travellers are experts at looking after horses.  It is a part of their culture with a long history and they provide excellent care but one small incident occurred and I would not want to tarnish everyone with the same brush.Thimbleby \u0026amp Shorland director Chris Boreham said he had not witnessed the incident but said the auction house will take measures to ensure they don\u0027t happen in the future.The Shetland Pony Stud Book Society was founded in 1890 to promote the breeding of Shetland ponies and publish the first ever studbook, or register, for a native breed of pony in Britain.Valued for its ability to pull twice its own body weight, Shetlands were used to carry peat and seaweed as well as transport owners across the Scottish islands.More modern uses for the ponies included farming, postal deliveries and pulling carts but animal welfare charities warned earlier this year more Shetlands were being kept as household pets, which had led to an increase in abandoned horses.Rescue centres warned buyers not to treat small horse breeds such as Falabella and miniature Shetlands like a cute designer accessory amid a rise in popularity.Brexit latest news: Special EU summit held to finalise Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal - live updatesDozens of \u0026#39innocent\u0026#39 dogs being destroyed under Dangerous Dogs Act, new figures show Brighton homeowners could face prosecution if they fail to remove graffiti from their property Vincent Van Gogh statue in Brixton will not feature pipe, gun or razor bladeNotting Hill Bookshop is inundated with requests as location for marriage proposals ahead of film\u0026#39s 20th anniversaryComment: 20mph zones aren\u0026#39t really about making roads safer – they\u0026#39re about stopping people driving altogetherComment: In defence of Jacob Rees-Mogg and his Brexit Dad\u0026#39s ArmyBrexit latest news: Britain accused of caving in over Gibraltar - live updatesComment: Let\u0026#39s get to the root cause of the Grenfell tragedyComment: Forget the naysayers, there\u0026#39s nothing quite like the joy of cold, hard cash Inside North Korea: How Kim Jong-un is carefully crafting a personality cult to keep grip on powerIndian police map area of island where US man was killed by tribeZimbabwe\u0026#39s Robert Mugabe unable to walk, seeking treatment in SingaporeCutting EU migration could cost Scotland £2billion, according to Government Mexico\u0026#39s new government agrees to Trump\u0026#39s \u0026#39asylum waiting room\u0026#39 planMurder detectives hunt man after woman found stabbed to death in St Helens homeHurlingham Club poker night for 15-year-olds branded \u0026#39staggeringly ill-conceived\u0026#39 by anti gambling campaignAdders to be given new protected habitat as conservationists admit battle to overturn image problemRiots on the Champs-Elysées as \u0026#39yellow vest\u0026#39 fuel protesters march in ParisWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/19/15/cwacom03.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-4371251  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 1.

Cloudy with a Chance of MeatballsKicking us off is Phil Lord and Christopher Mille’s bizarre animated film about a scientist who creates a machine that transforms water into food. So far, not too crazy, but then the machine gets stuck in the sky and it starts raining food. Everything goes wrong and Flint Lockwood must save the day by flying up to the machine and kicking fried chicken butt. Yeah, a pretty crazy premise, but a fantastic film.Michael Fassbender may be one of the most bankable stars of the moment - having starred in the likes of Steve Jobs, X-Men and Macbeth - but in 2014, instead of flaunting his face, producers decided to make him wear a weird papier-mâché mask for the film’s near entirety. The plot see’s Fassbender’s titular character front a rock band, play SXSW and make ‘likeable’ music. It’s all just a bit strange.Almost anything with Bill Murray in it is a win in my book, but when you say the premise of Ground Hog day out loud - a weatherman who must relive the same day over and over again - it sounds quite boring. What transpired was one of Murray’s funniest films.With Star Wars being so prevalent in pop-culture, it’s hard to imagine a time when no-one except George Lucas knew what a Lightsaber was. Producers must have been shocked when this young director came into the office trying to sell a script about Luke Skywalker, R2D2, Darth Vader, Chewbacca and Stormtroopers. Thankfully, they believed in his vision and now we have one of the best sci-fi sagas of all time.A dream, within a dream, within a dream. Even those who watched Inception were left confused, let alone those who only heard what the film was about. Christopher Nolan’s final flick, however, was a masterclass in storytelling and one of the best films of the last ten years.The high-concept Speed is quite ridiculous really. Keanu Reeves can’t let a bus go below 50 miles per hour or it will blow up. It’s quite amazing how Jan de Bont managed to make his debut 116 minutes long in the first place, let alone making it a decent film in the process.Tim Burton is a director who could fill this entire list up. While he may have chosen to reboot numerous films in the past few years (Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the upcoming Dumbo 2) it was his original concepts that set him apart from everyone else. In Burton’s head, the love story of a man with scissors for hands and a young woman made complete sense, while for everyone else - from just the premise - it seemed entirely weird. Luckily, he was given the opportunity to make the film and a cult classic was born, all while Johnny Depp’s ability to play the outsider was solidified. Post-Hook and Aladdin, Robin Williams was on a role. One of his standout performances was as Mrs. Doubtfire, the father-turned-drag-housekeeper. As a premise, dressing your lead male as a woman wasn’t exactly new (see Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie), so the filmmakers ran the risk of it all seeming like an overdone joke. Luckily, Chris Columbus managed to pull off the ridiculous plot (how wouldn’t the kids know it’s their father, really?) leading to one of the funniest films of the 90s.Like Burton, most of Yorgos Lanthimos’s films could probably feature on this page, but we’ve gone with The Lobster. The film tells of a hotel where residents must find a suitable partner within 45 days otherwise they will be turned into an animal. Try to run away and the other residents will hunt you down with tranquillisers. The result was one of the best love stories of 2015.Some comic book superheroes should not be adapted to the big screen (*cough* Howard the Duck *cough*). Ant-Man is not one of them. Against all the odds, Paul Rudd and Peyton Reed managed to make a compelling film about a man who could shrink down in size and control ants. What’s incredible is that - somehow - the film quickly became one of Marvel’s most beloved films. Of course, everyone knew Marvel could pull off weird, having knocked it out of the park with s of the Galaxy the year before.Two ghosts living in their old home want to scare away the alive people who now live there. Unfortunately, the new home-owners can’t see them and so the ghosts have to call upon a deranged Michael Keaton to help them out. Add one of the strangest afterlife scenes in film history and you’ve got a brilliant film.While not an obvious contender like Star Wars or Beetlejuice, when you think about it, Forrest Gump is a weird idea. A below-average intelligent man, sitting on a bench, waiting for a bus, telling strangers about all the famous moments in history where he observedeffected. Thanks to Tom Hanks, Gump was a magical film of love and hope, winning over the hearts of thousands and becoming an instant classic.Another film from Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, The Lego Movie shouldn’t have worked. Making a beloved toy into a film it was all just a bit silly. Thankfully, Chris Pratt’s turn as Emmett (and a catchy song in “Everything is Awesome”) the film was a huge hit with critics and fans alike, and now we have a cinematic universe of Lego movies to come. Awesome?“Let’s get Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Marcus Carl Franklin, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger, and Ben Whishaw to all play Bob Dylan in a single film”, Todd Haynes said.

While her original co-star Dick Van Dyke will appear, Andrews turned down Disney’s offer to return out of respect to Blunt’s portrayal of the magical nanny.Andrews has lent her voice to several films in the past, with roles in Despicable Me, Shrek 2 and Enchanted in which she was the narrator.Aquaman is released in the UK on 14 December, mere days before Mary Poppins Returns (19 December). The former DC adventure also stars Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson and Nicole Kidman.Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They won’t accept my BitPay, what’s the point of Black Friday sales fiat losers?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On a weekday, when thousands of commuters were trying to get to work, college and school let alone the other, vast number of folk who thought they they would see the railway as their most convenient form of travel.Because it was in the North, the stoppage raised barely a glimmer of interest in the South. If it had happened in Kent or Surrey, to trains into London Bridge or Waterloo, all hell would have broken loose. Instead, it was just another day of misery, to go with the other numerous days lost, including when they changed the timetable, and the services across the North could not cope.Meanwhile, the Government is pressing ahead with a £56bn plan to develop HS2. Will the new high-speed link between London and the North-West change any of this? Will it improve things? Not at all. Will it make a difference that justifies such vast expenditure? Hardly. Is it a grotesque example of ministerial machismo, of gesture politics, of a total inability to see the wood for the trees? You bet it is.Archaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeNow we know HS2 really is a flawed projectHS2 requires extra £43bn \u0027for people to make the most of it\u0027The trains I’m talking about, the ones that were cancelled, were mostly on the branch lines, on the routes that people use day in, day out - not the West Coast Line, which already has a fast, comfortable service. In my lifetime, since growing up in Cumbria, and travelling to and from London to visit family, journey times have plummeted. On the main, trunk route - not on the secondary ones. This is where the problem lies, where the service is creaking.Cutting several minutes off the London to Manchester service does not matter a h’apporth. What would boost the experience immeasurably there would be to ensure that wifi works all the way, that a mobile signal is not lost. But that, too, is not what HS2 is about.Already, there is talk by those on the inside that the projected costs are soaring. The “main works civil contracts” on the London to Birmingham section, reports The Sunday Times, are “several billion pounds” over the official budget of £6.6bn. That’s before any earth is turned, and all manner of unseen, below ground problems are discovered.Conscious of a final bill that could spiral out of control, and being seen to get a grip, ministers are demanding that instead of sanctioning extra expenditure, costs are being renegotiated, to stick to the budgeted figure. This, in turn, has led to delays, as more design and development is required, and specifications redrawn. Again, the word is that the vast project - the country’s biggest and most demanding infrastructure scheme - is likely to be more than a year behind schedule.That\u0027s how fast HS2\u0026nbspservices will travel at when the project is completedPart of the issue here is that mooted figures are proving inaccurate, the result, apparently of an insistence that the new railway meets a deadline for the beginning of services, of 2026.The thinking behind this demand, that Britain is sick and tired of major capital constructions that seem to take forever to reach fulfilment (runway expansion of Heathrow was first raised exactly 50 years ago) is laudable. But put that together with a scheme that is huge and complex, and it can become a recipe for chaos. And that’s without HS2 being unnecessary in the first place.This is what ministers should realise: that £56bn buys you an awful lot of terribly needed enhancements, for instance to existing country and suburban services, and to digitalisation.There is a subtext, of course, to HS2 - one that is hardly ever raised, let alone publicly admitted. And it is that the 250mph railway has another purpose, beyond rushing passengers from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. It is that the faster railway makes commuting from Birmingham in particular all that more manageable. House prices in the West Midlands are so much cheaper than in the South-East. Public sector workers in essential occupations, in sectors like the NHS and education, will be able to afford to commute from Brum. HS2, you see, is aimed in part at alleviating London’s growing housing crisis. Which makes it a very expensive solution indeed.When confronted with the news of the overruns and delay, the Department for Transport said it would not comment on speculation. “Our priority is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.”Yes, but does the overall project seriously provide value for money?Ministers have the ability to stop it in its tracks, to ert the investment elsewhere. Of course, that would involve a loss of pride. There would be some dismay in the North, but not as much as might be expected - particularly if the money was spent on other local, much-needed advancements. Perhaps they should test attitudes towards the new service before it\u0027s too late.For there are warning lights flashing all over this. An awful lot of cash is being committed to something for which there is little demand. Getting from A to B may become quicker, but B to C will be just as slow –\u0026nbspand it’s the B to C that is used by so many people every day, that ceased to operate last week and will do so again, even with HS2.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Consumers are voting with fingers and thumbs.“Making it easy for customers to buy on mobile will be the key determinant not just for a good Black Friday, but for a good Christmas and even medium-term survival.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That could allow Apple to put the phone back on sale at a lower price.Apple designer Jony Ive explains his \u0027utterly absurd\u0027 way of workingThe new handsets released in September were available at an increased price compared with previous years: the new iPhone XR, pitched as the more affordable model, begins at the same price the top-end phones had been marketed at until the iPhone X came along.Instead of buying those new phones, customers have been opting for the iPhone 8, according to numerous reports. Price-conscious customers are realising they could buy last year\u0027s handset instead for a much lower cost\u0026nbsp– despite it not featuring the brand new iPhone design – and that is thought to be having an impact on sales of the more expensive models.It is not clear when the iPhone X will be re-introduced to the line-up, or even if it will make it back onto sale. The iPhone X features an almost identical design to the iPhone XS, but misses out on new features such as an improved camera and upgraded processor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But as\u0026nbspSean O’Grady\u0026nbspexplains, she is following in a long Conservative tradition\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentBattles over the UK\u0027s relationship with the continent have blighted successive Tory premiershipsCould Europe be enough to wreck yet another Tory premiership?As Theresa May faces prospective votes of no confidence,\u0026nbspin her leadership from her own MPs, and in her government from internal dissidents and opposition parties, it may be scant comfort that she would hardly be the first Conservative leader to see their dreams and ambitions destroyed by a subject – Europe – that is seemingly incapable of resolution.Indeed, May, punningly enough, exists as a sort of political mayflower – her\u0026nbsplife in office, be it long or short, devoted to one purpose only: Brexit. All the stuff about “burning injustices”, the high-minded schemes to reinvigorate the British economy with an “industrial strategy” – her own mild brand of corporatism – or the plight of the “just about managing” families has been subsumed by the question of Britain’s EU withdrawal.To use a modern phrase, her administration has not the “bandwidth” to deal with everything else as well as sort out Brexit in truth it doesn’t really have the capacity or the intellectual clout to deal with Brexit itself.\u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit in photos: a portrait of the West MidlandsIn order to break the blackmailing hold of her band of Eurosceptic fundamentalists – and, to be fair, the truculent resistance of the Europhiles – she sought her own mandate at the general election of 2017. In an inexplicably long campaign the British electorate did what they usually do when asked a question by a prime mister – they chose to answer a different one. Called upon to back her with the kind of resounding support that would give her the oomph needed to carry out her Lancaster House hardish Brexit plan, the British electorate instead decided to blow a large raspberry and vote in unthinkable numbers for Jeremy Corbyn.“Nothing has changed,” she foolishly said during yet another campaign cock-up. In reality everything changed when she lost her majority, her moral authority and her political autonomy. Ironically, from that moment on she was the captive of every voluble faction or personality persuaded they could do a better job than she could – and there was no shortage of those. It was quietly said that she wouldn’t lead her party into another general election, even after she had jettisoned her closest aides and handed a veto over her cabinet-making to the 1922 Committee. She indicated that she had got her party and the country into his mess – and would get them out of it. It might have been better all round if they’d just ditched her then but, as usual, her enemies were willing to wound but not to kill. (My apologies if that language seems too violently intemperate for our times)Those who refuse to contemplate consulting the British people would in my view make more likely our eventual exitThe outcome of the British general election of 2017 was, then, not the triumph of May and the Leavers, but the revenge of the Remainers. It has left its mark. Now May is chained to the radiator of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose illogical and inconsistent demands could only be carried out by means of ine intervention.Sad, as they say, but true and hardly unpredictable. We remember\u0026nbspall too well\u0026nbsphow David Cameron almost casually tossed away his place in history – which might otherwise have been relatively distinguished – with a pledge to hold an inout EU referendum. On 23 January 2013 – a day that should live in infamy – at a speech at the Bloomberg HQ in London, Cameron explained his rationale. To be fair, he had some good points to make:“Those who refuse to contemplate consulting the British people would in my view make more likely our eventual exit.“Simply asking the British people to carry on accepting a European settlement over which they have had little choice is a path to ensuring that when the question is finally put – and at some stage it will have to be – it is much more likely that the British people will reject the EU.“That is why I am in favour of a referendum. I believe in confronting this issue – shaping it, leading the debate. Not simply hoping a difficult situation will go away.”“First, the problems in the eurozone are driving fundamental change in Europe.Second, there is a crisis of European competitiveness, as other nations across the world soar ahead. And third, there is a gap between the EU and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years, and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is – yes – felt particularly acutely in Britain.”By the way, and as if to prove the sure touch, if not genius, for politics possessed by Tony Blair, the reaction of the ex-prime minister at the time to Cameron’s move is chillingly and amusingly prophetic:Travel Question: Will Brexit affect holidays in Spain?In the early 2010s, as the coalition cut its way to dismal poll ratings Cameron was, in truth, spooked by the rise of Nigel Farage and Ukip, capitalising on a widespread but inchoate set of grievances in post-financial crisis, post-austerity, “left-behind” Britain.Cameron feared being outflanked by them on the right, splitting the traditional Conservative vote and losing seats to Ed Miliband’s Labour Party. In a way his strategy succeeded – but too well. At the 2015 election, with the collapse in the Liberal Democrat vote, Labour’s rout in Scotland at the hands of the SNP and some recession in Ukip’s charge, very possibly because of Cameron’s referendum pledge, Cameron and his campaign manager George Osborne succeeded so far as to win an overall majority – the first Tory one since 1992. Instead of another round of coalition, with an even stronger Tory domination, they could steer their own course. Instead of being able to plead that “Nick Clegg won’t let me hold the referendum”, Cameron was forced to do so.Or was he? Back in 2015 and 2016 no one was much bothered. Europe hardly featured in the voters’ list of concerns, although immigration often did. Cameron might have got away with forgetting his promise (as he had before on a “cast-iron” one to hold a plebiscite on the Lisbon Treaty of 2009).In any event, Cameron was complacent and, like many, too mesmerised by the precedent of the 1975 vote, when the people tended to “follow the faces they trusted”, as the arch-Europhile Roy Jenkins remarkeCameron failed to see how times had changed, and how folk were more sceptical about “the establishment”, whipped up by Ukip. Cameron also refused to countenance “blue-on-blue” debates, which allowed Boris Johnson and Michael Gove to parade unchallenged directly by their Tory peers the Treasury’s “Project Fear”, by contrast, seemed implausible to many of the public.You can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble. We don’t want another three more of the bastards out there...So Cameron lost. He lost his party and his premiership, and he is now routinely relegated to the bottom of the historical premier premiership table, along with Sir Anthony Eden (Suez) and Neville Chamberlain (Munich), in their own ways also guilty of serious delusions about foreign policy. Maybe the memoir\u0026nbspCameron is composing in his £25,000 “shepherd’s cottage” will succeed in rehabilitating him.Before Cameron there was John Major. Like May today, Major faced a huge series of battles to get a European agreement through parliament: the Maastricht Treaty strengthened European integration, but also contained a series of British “opt-outs”, the most valuable being the right to keep the pound and avoid joining the ill-starred euro.Like May today as well, he had no overall majority for much of his time in parliament and a well-organised group of Eurosceptics tormenting him. Some crucial votes he only won with the support of the 20 or so Liberal Democrats, then led by Paddy Ashdown, prepared to put country before party Labour was uniformly hostile to Major’s legislation, though agreeing with almost everything in it.Eurosceptics (AFPGetty)Major, like May, had a gang of leaky Eurosceptics in cabinet permanently causing trouble. In an unguarded moment in front of a live mic, he let slip his true feelings:“Just think it through from my perspective. You are the prime minister, with a majority of 18, a party that is still harking back to a golden age that never was, and is now invented. You have three right-wing members of the cabinet who actually resign. What happens in the parliamentary party?“I could bring in other people. But where do you think most of this poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. You can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble.“We don’t want another three more of the bastards out there. What’s Lyndon Johnson’s maxim?...”May must feel the same way about today’s “gang of five”, the “pizza club” of Leadsom, Gove, Fox, Grayling and Mordaunt. And, indeed, about Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and John Redwood, still banging the same drum as they did in Major’s cabinet a quarter century ago. (At least Michael Portillo has gone off to play with trains and model garishly coloured blazers.)ITVRex)Major survived his own leadership crisis over Europe, one he felt he had to end himself by, shockingly, resigning his position as party leader (but not prime minister) and inviting his enemies to “put up or shut up”. John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, did so and scored respectably, but ultimately lost. So Major carried on, his authority scarcely enhanced before he was slaughtered by Blair in 1997. It was the Tories’ worst thrashing since 1832. As he himself said within weeks, it was time to “leave the stage”.When Major claimed that his foes were “still harking back to a golden age that never was, and is now invented”, it was plainly a reference to the Thatcher premiership – which remains to this day a golden age for the right of the Conservative Party and their fellow travellers in Ukip – the likes of Arron Banks and Farage explicitly declaring their devotion to her.\u0026nbspIn many ways the Leave campaign was a movement that sought to bring back Thatcherism, the EU being regarded as a pettifogging, bureaucratic,\u0026nbspeven socialist\u0026nbspbarrier to the return of free enterprise, low tax\u0026nbspand the small-state policies of the 1980s. It was, if you will, a campaign for Mrs Thatcher’s fourth term in office, the one she never got to deliver.Eurosceptics (KeystoneHulton ArchiveGetty)The allegiance to Thatcher was, however, of the late-vintage Thatcher – the one who, when she reached the Lords, was happy to vote against her own party on Maastricht the one who made the landmark Bruges speech in 1988, a sort of Old Testament for Eurosceptics. A brief extract gives its flavour:“We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain\u0026nbsponly to see them reimposed at a European level with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.“Certainly we want to see Europe more united and with a greater sense of common purpose.“But it must be in a way which preserves the different traditions, parliamentary powers and sense of national pride in one’s own country for these have been the source of Europe’s vitality through the centuries.”Pure prototype Ukip, you might say. Yet she also declared in that same address, less comfortably for the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Farage:“The lesson of the economic history of Europe in the Seventies and Eighties is that central planning and detailed control\u0026nbspdo not\u0026nbspwork and that personal endeavour and initiative\u0026nbspdo that a state-controlled economy is a recipe for low growth and that free enterprise within a framework of law brings better results.“The aim of a Europe open to enterprise is the moving force behind the creation of the single European market in 1992. By getting rid of barriers, by making it possible for companies to operate on a European scale, we can best compete with the United States, Japan and other new economic powers emerging in Asia and elsewhere.”Margaret Thatcher, the longest serving peacetime premier of the 20th century, left office on 22 November\u0026nbsp1990. She did so for four manifest reasons. First, what was called “style” – an increasingly imperious manner. Second, a deepening economic recession. Third, the poll tax, which was incredibly unpopular and became a direct threat to Tory MPs’ chances of holding on to their seats.

At the time the Conservative Party had many more European true believers at its head than today and when the then-leader of the Commons, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned in protest at the prime minister’s dismissive approach to Europe, she was fatally damaged. Her words at prime minister’s questions were the final straw for Howe, Michael Heseltine and the other Europhiles, and they echo down the years:Biggest rise in UK poverty since Thatcher was in power, experts claimThree weeks later she had had to quit, but not until she had had time to refuse\u0026nbspa request from the Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, to hold a general election so the British people could make their own choice about her successor. Plus ça change.The trouble for the Tories over Europe goes further back still. Britain’s first, belated attempt to join the then European Economic Community (EEC) was rejected after a few years of negotiations in 1963 – because of a French veto. After President Charles\u0026nbspde Gaulle said “non” to the UK, the fortunes of the Conservative movement declined markedly.The prime minister responsible\u0026nbspfor the bid, Harold Macmillan, saw it as the great strategic purpose of his administration:\u0026nbspthe way to find a role in the world as the British empire was being dismantled, and a way to boost the UK’s sluggish growth by joining in with the fastest growing economic bloc (apart from Japan) at the time. Macmillan, in the end, failed and his government was defeated by\u0026nbspLabour in 1964.In fact the only Tory leader to remotely prosper from Europe was Ted Heath, who was Macmillan’s chief negotiator – the reverse of a Brexit secretary – and went on to be the Tory PM who took the UK in to the EEC in 1973.Even there, though, the effort left some bad feelings among the small band of Tory proto-Eurosepctics, led by Enoch Powell, a man in love with parliament and fixated by sovereignty. More concerned with immigration, his hatred of the EEC was visceral, and his advice to Tory voters in marginal seats in the West Midlands in the 1974 election to vote Labour – because they\u0026nbsp were offering a referendum on staying in the EEC – was pivotal in pushing Heath out of No 10. So, in his way, even Heath was a victim of his party’s troubled and ambiguous relationship to the European issue.So there they are then: Macmillan, Heath, Thatcher, Cameron, May. Europe has haunted the Tories for almost seven decades, ever since Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan politely said “no” to an invitation to join attempts to create a European Community in the 1950s.Wrangling about Europe also badly distracted the Tories in opposition under William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith. The floor is littered with other political corpses and zombie policies (remember Hague’s “Save the Pound”?). Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine never became leader of their party because they were too pro-European. Others, such as Johnson and Gove, have\u0026nbspfound their anti-European crusading not quite sufficient to carry them into No 10, mainly because most of the parliamentary party remained relatively relaxed about the EU – epitomised by, say, Amber Rudd and\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond, as well as Cameron and Osborne.Further back in the mists of history, all the way back to the mid-19th century, we find the Conservatives split about protectionism and “imperial preference” as against global free trade. The issue came back time and again to mither Tory statesmen from Robert Peel to Stanley Baldwin. Only the Second World War forced them to take their minds off trade policy.The last Tory leader to talk much sense about Europe was in fact the Mark I David Cameron, the one who in 2006 told his party simply to “stop banging on about Europe”.Whatever happened to that idea?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

At six I wake in the box room bedroom at my grandparents that I’ve claimed as my own since coming to Cheshunt as a baby. Suddenly I’m 51: this is the last time I’ll ever sleep in this three-bed former council house on an estate on London’s northern edge. My paternal granddad Leslie died in 2014 and for over a year my nan Eileen has languished in a care home with worsening dementia, which means never again will she return to the house that for all those decades was the family home.After my grandfather returned from war, he, Nan and my infant father moved into a two-bed semi on a large estate being built for heroes called Bury Green: one of Nan’s ways to make ends meet was to clean the newly completed houses after the workmen had finished, walking the plank across muddy foundations, my father in her arms. When a larger, three-bed place came up further in they moved, the neighbours mucking in with hand carts.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memories. Soon, when Nan dies, or her savings run out, this house, the sole childhood home of my dad, uncle and auntie – which my grandparents agonised over buying due to their socialist principles – will be sold. After half a century, I look round for a final time, and close the door.How a family hiking trip left me thinking about mortalityRecently I realised that dozens of places important to my family stretching back 100 years took place along the A10New River layline between Cheshunt and Soho. The birthplace of my father, two of my grandparents and my two children the places where I, my parents, and grandparents, met our partners and where we married several of my former homes, plus the ones in which my mum, dad and grandparents grew up schools and universities where me, my kids, my parents and grandparents studied and worked, are all strung along a 20-mile route which I have decided to walk in one day: a long trek into my past, back to the warm heart of my city.The November sun is rising over “New” River (dating from 1613) at the end of the street, the same street on which Cliff Richard was raised and whose forged autographs my father sold round school as a kid. Cutting through the alley where I learnt to ride my bike and where louts often linger with flickering lighters, I leave the estate, passing the graveyard where my great-grandmother Flo is buried, and cross the metal footbridge that crosses the A10, watching trucks and cars thunder to and from London.Being political animals, my granddad ran the tenant’s association, Nan the Labour women’s section. One day in the Fifties she invited an earnest young prospective candidate (who had no chance despite estates like Bury Green, Cheshunt was Tory) to speak to the Labour ladies about his policies. Nan was mortified by the way the other women sat, listened and carried on knitting, needles flashing and clicking like praying mantes. The pleasant young man was Dennis Potter: years later, Nan would watch his TV play Vote, vote, vote for Nigel Barton\u0026nbspand shudder with recognition.Piggott and his mum Flo in 1915\u0026nbspAs you walk east on College Road a huge tree – possibly a cedar of Lebanon – that has barely changed since I was a kid marks the start of Blindman’s Lane. Here, at 55, my paternal grandfather Leslie Piggott grew up in a bungalow without hot water, one of five siblings to Florence and Edwin Piggott, who were doubly blessed. First, because Ed was stone deaf, thus escaping the trenches second, because he was a nursery foreman which meant there was always food on the table – unlike many homes in what in the Twenties was one of the poorest rural districts in England. (Their luck would change: their only daughter died of cancer and their son Vincent was killed in action in the Second World War).Even when I was a kid – spending many of my school holidays in Cheshunt – the town had become a distant suburb of London, joined by the threads of rail, river and road, but back in the Seventies the town was overwhelmingly white Tesco ran the town like the Cosa Nostra. Today’s inhabitants are more erse and Turkish grocers surround the Old Pond in my granddad’s youth, the only Turk most Cheshunt people would have met would have been at Gallipoli.Piggott at St George’s Church in 1940\u0026nbspAt Old Pond roundabout – where Vincent Piggott’s name is inscribed on the war memorial – I turn right down Turners Hill, past the library where my grandfather worked as a teen before discovering the money in the factory was better, past the site of long-demolished Merston House where he was born in 1915. Turners Hill merges into Crossbrook Street, which runs down to Waltham Cross (still as ugly as the day I was born) and has another family connection. In 1944, when my father Michael was just two weeks old, my grandfather wrote him a letter from his RAF base:“On a certain April evening in 1939, my pal ‘Ginger’ Liddard and I were off for a stroll and a drink along Crossbrook Street to Waltham Cross. In those days, I’m afraid, I was rather a heavy drinker, but anyhow I’ll leave the explanation of my sins until later, so back to my story. We had just passed Cheshunt Building Society when all of a sudden we heard a ‘Hullo’ from the opposite side of the road, and when ‘Ging’ and I looked over we saw, what appeared to us in the dim light, a pair of very young girls. We stuck our noses in the air, said ‘schoolgirls trying to be funny!’ and passed on our way to the nearest pub. On our way back to Cheshunt we ran into the two ‘schoolgirls’ again, this time on our side of the road, and lo! And behold! They were not schoolgirls but very pleasurable young ladies of some 17 years of age…”Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another lifeOne of the girls was one Eileen Ball from Enfield. The pair began courting Nan was much impressed by Granddad’s good manners, smart appearance and relative affluence as a skilled toolmaker he earned double most of his contemporaries. In 1940, Granddad was given leave from the RAF where he now worked as a Spitfire mechanic beneath Guy Gibson to marry Nan at St George’s Church, Hertford Road. The photographs of their wedding day will be instantly familiar to anyone with English ancestry: grandfather in uniform, grandmother in white. Go into any English home and you’ll find variations on the theme: an ancestor in uniform, smiling uncertainly into the lens (not wanting to be at the centre of this or indeed of anything), a determined, set look keep calm, and if you come home carry on propagating the genes.St George’s has hardly changed, to my unpractised eye: red brick, imposing, small memorial garden out front where a mourning woman lays flowers. A couple of streets further down I pass Unity Road, where my father was born in 1944. Bombing raids were a part of life: years later my nan, an air raid warden in the factory where she worked, recalled:“When Michael was about six weeks old, early one evening, I was breastfeeding him when we heard the sound of what we thought was a hit plane coming down. I shot under the table in my mum’s dining room crouching over Michael, who, luckily, was blissfully unaware of the danger and went on suckling!”Unity Road is suburban, low-rise, and seems more affluent than the surrounding blocks. I have a photograph from May 1945 of a Unity Estate VE tea party, Nan holding my father in her arms (unmissable, due to her habit of tippexing outlines round family members in any group photos). Now, on the corner, perhaps on the very site of that street party, stands a vast Lidl.From Unity Road it’s a slog through scrofulous suburbs and a characterless stretch of the A10 (the factories in which Granddad worked – Murex, Thorns, Manifold – are now retail parks) to Bertram Road, Bush Hill Park. My nan was born at 104, and grew up at 122, poor, half her father’s weekly wage of £2 from Ediswans lightbulb factory going on the rent.Nan’s dad, Arthur Ball – a name I imagine caused some merriment in the factory – also worked in the factories up the A10. Enfield was heavily industrialised and would be a prime target during the war. One of Arthur’s workmates was Jimmy Dimmock: he worked in the factory all week, then turned out for Spurs of a Saturday. When unemployed, which was often, Arthur – teetotal, musician, talented painter – set up a group for dole-drawers in a hut. He sat Eileen on his knee when she was five and explained how everyone had a right to clean linen nan took it to heart. She left school at fourteen to help out and got a job at the same factory as her dad, where she was known like all the typists as an “office tart”,\u0026nbspand at dinner time Arthur would come through the rubber doors that separated classes (factory and office pool) with his trolley and give her jam sandwiches a taste of an older England long since gone to Pot Noodle.Despite her poverty, Nan’s memories of childhood are generous and rich, recalling games in the street, kids in and out of one another’s houses, evenings round the piano, doting grandparents nine doors down.The current occupier of Nan’s childhood home, Peter, generously lets me come in and see the place Nan was raised. Peter, a rough, friendly decorator of 53, and his wife have lived here for years but are shortly moving to Winchmore Hill.I’m surprised at the size of the house, with its big back garden and kitchen extension, and have to remind myself that when Nan lived here the extension wouldn’t have existed, and lacked even electricity, let alone flatscreen TV.From Bertram Road it’s a drab, dreary walk to Arnos Grove, passing through the middle-class ghetto of Winchmore Hill (where my mother grew up in the station house), the site of Minchenden Grammar (which Mum attended with Lynne Franks and Martin Rushent), Mum’s first place of work – the Metal Box Company on the North Circular – to the former council flat where her father, my maternal granddad, resides. All these suburban streets look the same, and I keep getting lost: at one low point I have to double back and walk a mile out of my way uphill. I’m less than halfway through my odd odyssey and exhausted, and for the first time begin to worry I won’t make it, chide myself for failing to do any preparation whatsoever – unless you count walking to the offie.Despite Granddad’s claims, the Piggotts weren’t drinkers and the Balls of Methodist stock so when it comes to alcohol, I must take after my mum’s parents. My mum’s mum, Kit Walsh, had to leave Ireland when she got pregnant there are rumours Mum has an older sibling somewhere who was given away. When I was born my nan was still only 36 she’d give me whiskey to help me sleep. Nan was what you might call a character, and great fun. On one occasion when I stayed as a kid, she came in saying she’d just met Jesus on the tube. We thought she’d finally lost it then it transpired she’d met Robert Powell and given him whiskey from the bottle she kept in her fake fur coat and taught him to sing The Men Behind The Wire.Now 95, Jack Brown has lived in a smart three-bed flat in one of the four-storey blocks for 50 years, raising with Kit six children. Many of my holidays as a child were ided between here and Cheshunt, between my two sets of grandparents. Today all the blocks are covered in scaffolding, making them seem grimmer than ever: there’s no entry phone and when I bang on Granddad’s door he shouts fearfully from within: “Who’s that?”“Me, Granddad. Mark.” (Adding, as always:\u0026nbsp“Sandy’s son.”)Granddad opens the door, looking every day of 95: he is short, as are all my forebears, five two, stocky, face still fierce, still with a purple boozer’s nose though he can no longer drink anything but J2O. He shuffles back to the lounge on his walking stick and we sit at his desk. Kit died at Chase Farm in 2008 a few years later my mum’s youngest brother, my uncle, five years younger than me, assaulted his dad and went to prison. An exclusion order remains in place, and now Granddad’s only visitors are a daughter and her partner. I ask Granddad how he is.“Not so good,” he growls, still with a faint Ipswich burr in his accent after all the decades. “I got robbed.” A week earlier, two young men posing as workmen on the renovation used fake ID cards to gain access one distracted my grandfather while the other took £400 he’d been saving to buy his communist chums a pint for his birthday. A few days later, just down the road, a 98-year-old was beaten almost to death for his TV.Granddad looks shaken, vulnerable: this family is no stranger to bleak times (Nan mugged on her way home from Bingo, Uncle Liam, stabbed, Uncle Liam, brain-damaged, Uncle Liam, diagnosed with MS, Uncle Liam – who gave me my middle name – who died this year), but I sense this might be the last straw. What a sad end for a man who stood as a Communist Party MP, who ed into burning seas to save Navy comrades after his ship was torpedoed, who worked for 40 years for British Rail, where he showed John Betjeman how to change signals and who once travelled to Moscow with Kit by train. Nan Brown often told me how they were invited to a grand ball in Moscow and as they ascended the sweeping staircase she hissed at my grandfather: “Jack! Your flies are undone!” “That’s nothing,” said Granddad. “You’ve got your dress tucked in your knickers.”Created with Sketch.The London that could have been Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Planned in the 1960s when bus use was declining and personal car use was increasing.

Now I recall Nan Piggott telling me of the reception at my mum and dad’s wedding, where my Irish nan’s contribution to the buffet was a string of uncooked sausages and where during a slow dance Jack slid his hand down over Eileen’s bottom as his wife suggested wife-swapping to shocked Granddad Piggott: two very different families, brought together only briefly in a ceremony at Haringey Civic Centre, my mum’s black dress bulging visibly, guests including Fairport Convention.Neither my mum or dad recalls the date they married (the marriage itself only lasted two years), but both recall where I was conceived: at a Socialist Labour League conference in Morecambe, shortly after friend-of-the-Redgraves Gerry Healy told Mum: “I will sleep with you on the eve of the revolution.”For a time, Mum and Dad lived in Rosebery Road, Muswell Hill, in a house with a shared bathroom Mum recalls bopping around the living room to Dizzy Gillespie as her belly expanded. Dad was quite the lad about town in the mid-Sixties: hanging out in jazz clubs and\u0026nbspshebeens, a groovy dude in velvet pantaloons. Once, he tells me, Rod Stewart nicked his dope another time he was on the door of a party in Chelsea when four scruffy looking louts tried to enter. Dad barred their way, to be informed he’d bounced the Rolling Stones. Dad got into an unspecified spot of bother and the young couple went north to Manchester, where I was born: a northerner in spirit but not a drop of northern blood.From Wood Green it’s another slog, through Hornsey and Crouch End and up the hill to Hornsey Rise, then right along Hornsey Lane, thoroughly exhausted now, wolfing eclairs and Coke, the unseasonal November sun blinding. Just before Suicide Bridge – immortalised, if that’s the word, in my first novel Fire Horses – a passing white van smashes the wing mirror of a parked van and the debris of glass and torn metal hits me: the van doesn’t stop. Nor do I. Standing on the bridge I look down over the bowl of my city, London proper.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memoriesArchway Tower – where I used to sign on – has been transformed into an apartment block, reflecting the transformation of an area which in the 1980s – when I lived in a condemned row for three mostly unhappy years – was dubbed “where angels fear to tread”. We stuck the article on the wall, a badge of pride. Much of those years are now just a blur: dropping acid during the Great Hurricane, drinking with Pete Postlethwaite a blazing row with Kathy Acker.In my first published story, “Hatful of Holloway”, I imagined a terror attack in which Archway Tower is blown up and falls onto what used to be the Archway Tavern, a rough Irish pub where they cashed your giros at a counter and men waited each morning at six for the van to the site. The same year that story was published, I was at Archway Station with my wife and baby daughter when we heard about the 77 terror attacks: I remember looking down Junction Road, trying to work out the safest way home with our precious pram cargo, and suddenly it looked like a corridor of glass.Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another life. Crossing Highgate Hill, where Dick Whittington turned again, I walk down Dartmouth Park Hill, past the Whittington Hospital where two years apart our two children were born in the same delivery room, a continuation of a process of self-gentrification that mirrors the new N19, where plastered Irish builders have become Damian Lewis and Benedict Cumberbatch. My Irish nan drank in the Boston in the 1950s, telling me how anyone who refused to put money in the IRA collection plate was thrown out the window the Boston remains satisfyingly down-market, with racing on the TV and smokers congregating at the door even as goths queue for the Dome next door.Limping past Cathcart Hill, where I lived from 1999 to 2013 with my wife and then our two children after nine brief months in the country we were pulled back, to Finsbury Park (where, in 1987, I presented Network Seven and hung out with junkies on Six Acre and Andover) and then back to the manor, to Warrender Road, where we live today.Utterly exhausted I enter the house: my wife makes me tea and sandwiches, Daughter, 14, teases me about my bedraggled appearance Son, 12 shows me the game he’s been creating on his laptop. It would be so easy to sit here and sleep: but I have made a promise, to myself at least, so after dumping my bag I say goodbye and walk, past Mercers Road, the first house in London I lived in aged 18, where a regular visitor – much to my excitement – was Roland “Fine Young Cannibals” Gift, then at the peak of his fame. In the distance I see London Met on Holloway Road, where I took a degree 10 years later, and where, 10 years after that, my first novel was launched (and sank without trace).Past Lloyds Bank at Highbury Corner, part of which used to be a curry house above which I shared a room with my oldest friend which had no windows, and maggots on the carpet, and where we had to place a disconnected door in the door-shaped hole to allow the other to defecate in peace. Where, the day in 1991 I received the letter confirming I’d been allocated my own little flat, I picked up a bottle of cider from the floor, took a swig in celebration, then realised it contained urine.Highbury Corner, where the Islington Twins used to hang out, and those older, odder twins used to walk up and down in matching checked suits, and where I once slept in bushes at the centre of the roundabout, and The Cock, where Arthur Mullard made me get off his stool. Down Upper Street, past 127, the site of Brown and Blair’s infamous Granita Pact, which I mentioned in a novel past the red-brick Municipal Office where I both worked and signed on past the town hall where in 2003 my wife and I were the first to be married in the chambers: we appear on council literature. My mum and dad met just around the corner, at an SLL meeting: they saw eye to eye, not only politically, but physically, dad being 5ft 2in, mum 4ft 11in.Between them they were over 10ft tall.To the Angel and past Nags Head, for so many years our pub of choice: sometimes when I had no money I’d walk up and down Upper Street for hours, watching all the drinkers behind warm glass. Taking a right up White Lion Street I pass a Hilton, bemused: in the 1980s King’s Cross was still rough. Up York Way, we attended “acid rock” warehouse parties in 1986 today I turn south onto Amwell Street, passing the flats where I lived with J and her mum back in 1989-90 before it all fell apart (all me – my bad).Filthy McNasty’s – where I set a key scene of my first book, and once drank with Shane MacGowan – is now the George and Monkey. One night on mushrooms I had a bad trip there, and Amwell Street extended to eternity. At Roseberry Avenue I pass Finsbury Town Hall, where I was once best man, stinking drunk because I’d just been on the telly.Exmouth Market had pie’n’mash and jellied eels when I lived in the Peabody Flats (1991-98) I pass the pub where the blind man used to give his guide dog Guinness in an ashtray. Down the steps I staggered down a thousand times: in Australia, 1994, homesick, I was watching A Fish Called Wanda when I saw those same steps, my own flat. I look up at the tiny bedsit where I lived and died a thousand deaths, crushed by loneliness and rage some rainy winter Sundays I would walk from my flat to the Thames without seeing a soul, go days without uttering a word. I became so introverted, so lacking in confidence and self-esteem that I began to imagine a huge coat which as I walked through the snow would erase all my footsteps, leave no trace. But then Clerkenwell Green around the corner is where I explained to J that one day, I would be quite the catch, and she laughed and at Clerkenwell Green I learnt my first novel was to be published.I’d only been living in Farringdon Lane a few months when a new neighbour moved into the flat directly upstairs. By a bizarre coincidence it was J’s best friend D, with whom we’d once trekked across Europe D now worked as a childminder for Mike Leigh and told him about this strange event. A year or two later, when Naked was released, I was somewhat perturbed by the similarities between the Thewlis character and myself. Pure coincidence, of course though later, when D told me about Secrets and Lies and I asked if it was about her, D laughed and said – “No, Mark – it’s about you. Again.”When I first got involved with the magazine, I was also still vaguely involved with Class War, agitating at Wapping, appearing on page 2 of The Sun holding a misspelt banner when Princess Anne came to tour the youth project I was locked in a room because they were scared that I’d burst out with placards.Memorial for Sikh soldiers vandalised in first week after unveilingBrain implants will soon allow hackers to ‘manipulate memories’How memory can help build confidence in the kitchenIt has grown dark, and as I begin the final stretch to Soho in my long back coat, I feel invisible. Am I really here, or just another ghost in a city full of ghosts from Roman armies to Amy Winehouse? My steps and breath shorten the pain in my thighs, calves, feet, hips intensify: but now I know I will make it.I pass the Phoenix, site of my second book launch in 2010, when it seemed authordom was mine and easy. Eighteen months later I was back on the dole. As I limp up Shaftesbury Avenue each step is a torment, but now I see my destination just across the road, in Soho proper: The Coach and Horses.Why end here? Well, I had to end somewhere, so why not a pub – one I frequented when Jeffrey Bernard propped up the bar, and I had to restrain a mate from flattening Norman Balon who’d called him a cunt, and where, years later, for two short hours, I was part of the media aristocracy?Entering, I order a Guinness. The barmaid smiles and serves. I check my pedometer: 48,664 steps, 20.7 miles. No, there’s another reason I picked this pub.1999: My lowest ebb. Having graduated from college and secured an agent I borrowed £10,000 from a bank in anticipation of the advance that was surely coming, and never did. With fellow loons I drifted across the capital, drinking and taking whatever else I could find all night and day, sometimes sleeping rough at one point in Oxford Street I lay on the bonnet of a car and was carried for several hundred yards. Then, later, as police came to arrest me for causing a disturbance in my flats, I smashed my fist through a window and almost severed the hand entirely I was rushed to hospital but after being bandaged left again, still buzzing. Next morning a doctor removed the temporary bandage and I saw my severed wrist, tendons and veins dangling, like a robot I was rushed back to hospital for emergency surgery.A few days later I wandered into the Coach and Horses, Soho, where a pretty trainee nurse from Liverpool smiled and seeing my ragged, loose sling said in a kind voice:“Are you OK?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The moment in question madeher look incapable of reading aloud and saw co-presenter\u0026nbspTess\u0026nbspDaly silently stunned as the floor manager (presumably) fainted. \u0026nbspUp until then, the most shocking moment of the night was one of this series’s favourites – former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts – only finishing third on the leaderboard.Here are the episode\u0027s five biggest talking points.There were many sniggers about how our seven remaining couples might crash into each other when they all took to the floor simultaneously to lindyhop the audience into submission. But in the end, it was the judges who provided the carnage. When the music stopped,\u0026nbspBallas was asked to read out who came 7th. After a technical error meant her digital read out was unavailable, she reached for a scrap of paper and duly read out who had come first. Then she got the names of the professional dancers wrong. And was left to tie herself in knots before Claudia Winklemen eventually diffused the tension with a couple of one-liners. Seann\u0026nbspand Katya will be furious they now have competition for the most awkward moment of the series.Faye and Giovanni’s dream waltzAshley and Pasha remain the only couple to receive a perfect 40 (translation: the only ones that\u0026nbspCraig Revel-Horwood has given a ten), but Faye\u0026nbspTozer and her partner, Giovanni, got really close tonight. They were nervous after abandoning their American Smooth to save Gio’s bad back mid-week, \u0026nbspin favour of a waltz mid-week. But you couldn’t tell: it was a dreamy, graceful routine met with a shower of judges’ compliments. They finished top of the leaderboard and surely booked their place in next week’s quarter final.Stacey and Kevin’s fierce pasoStacey Dooley loved her Blackpool salsa so much she didn’t wash her hair for a week to preserve the memories. Watch her interview on Friday’s It Takes Two if you don’t believe me. After initially panicking about the ‘Paso Dooley’, she really attacked this number and Kevin choreographed an incredible routine to atmospheric, authentic music. After waiting all series for a ten they got three. See you in the final, Stace.Created with Sketch.

While Shirley and Brrruno adored Joe sugg’s hip-hop inspired routine with props, tricks and writhing around on the ground, Craig and Darcey were a bit more reserved. Two tens seemed rather generous, but then again Strictly are always looking to encourage younger viewers to stay watching the show…Lauren’s out of her depthAfter hoping last week’s low-scoring Argentine Tango was a one-off, Lauren Steadman was gutted to get underwhelming feedback for her salsa tonight. Public support saves her every week, however vulnerable her spot on the leaderboard, but she’s struggling to keep up with the competition now. Will her fans save her again? Pool enthusiasts certainly won’t be impressed after she and her partner, AJ, wrecked a perfectly good table by jumping on it.So, who will go? This is a very different question from who ‘should’ go? While Lauren was by far the weakest dancer, dance-off regulars Graeme and Charles both find themselves on the bottom half of the leaderboard. One of them is bound to run out of luck tomorrow night….Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And now we will do the same thing in Morecambe.“So, we have talked about things like what do you find on the beach there?\u0026nbspYou find mussel colonies and, funnily enough, when you want a structure that has the ability to house gardens and attractions and to give people a unique experience, well, the shape of mussel shells would be perfect.”Attractions within, he said, would introduce visitors to Earth’s various water worlds in the same way Eden Cornwall – which boats a 16,000 square metre rainforest – introduced people to the planet’s plants and trees.Grimshaw Architects)“There, the focus is on plants and humans and their interdependence,” he said. “So, here, we’ll be doing something similar but in a marine context.“The first priority is getting people to connect with the bay outside the front door but that will then allow us to tell the story of what goes on in other places around the world and give portals through to those places.”He said the emphasis would be on visitor interaction and described a possible attraction where people could walk through a single magnified drop of water to experience how much invisible life teems within: “We don’t want this to be passive or a standard museum – we are in the business of giving people experiences they would not get elsewhere.”The autumn announcement that an Eden was to be built in Morecambe – if funds could be raised – brought much excitement to the town, with MP David Morris hailing it as a “game-changer”.The announcement\u0026nbspfollowed a year of behind-the-scenes work after Lancaster University first approached Eden Project International and sold it\u0026nbspthe idea of opening its second UK venue in the town.\u0026nbspThey said Morecambe – a once thriving seaside destination now widely perceived to have fallen on hard times – was in need of the same regeneration which the Eden Project Cornwall had brought to that region since opening in a disused clay pit in 2001. They pointed out that the town’s bay – famed for the speed with which the tide comes in – was an area of special scientific interest which would suit enviro-tourism.“We get a lot of approaches from different places across the world,” said Mr Harland, who says Eden Project International\u0026nbspis investigating other possible venues in China, South America and New Zealand. “But this one spoke to us and to what we are about.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England batsman Jonny Bairstow celebrates after reaching his century during Day One of the Third Test match against Sri Lanka at Sinhalese Sports Club in ColomboPrime Minister Theresa May joins a parent and baby group during a visit to the Kentish Town Health Centre in LondonA crashed car, with an object protruding through the windscreen, sits abandoned on the A628 in the Peak District, as a blast of snow hit the north of EnglandWaves crash over Seaham lighthouse near Durham as the cold and wet weather continuesPrime Minister Theresa May speaking at the CBI annual conference at InterContinental Hotel.

The sticking point on such huge projects, however, can often be local opinion.So far, claims Mr Harland, that has\u0026nbspbeen overwhelmingly positive.“You know how news works,” he said. “We announce we’re doing this thing, then the local TV goes out and finds two people in favour and one against, and in Morecambe, they were struggling with that. Across the board we’re getting support because… I think people can see the potential it has for the town.”Issues such as pressure on local transport links and infrastructure would be smoothed out as part of the development, he said.\u0026nbsp“Those are the things that people worry about – and rightly, because let’s not kid ourselves, people will be impacted. What we say is the impact will be offset by the social and economic benefits which this will bring.”Certainly, the benefits have been felt in Cornwall. It has attracted 19 million visitors and pumped an estimated £2bn\u0026nbspinto the local economy since opening 17 years ago.“We would love to do that for Lancashire,” said Mr Harland. “The history of Morecambe is that this was a place where, traditionally, people went to escape, take the air and seek a version of the exotic. That’s all we’ll be doing now –\u0026nbsptrying to bring back the exotic.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”Ms Rudd also cast doubt on Ms May’s plans to seal the Brexit deal at a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, acknowledging there are still obstacles in the way.“Hopefully it will get through this week,” she said, adding: “There is still a negotiation going on in terms of actually getting this agreement through.”The comments make Ms Rudd the first cabinet minister to rule out a no-deal Brexit – and the first to suggest an agreement at European level could yet be derailed.They came as the prime minister prepared to head to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, under huge pressure for further “wins” in the final text.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

I want that to be a moment of renewal and reconciliation for our whole country.“It must mark the point when we put aside the labels of ‘Leave’ and ‘Remain’ for good and we come together again as one people.“To do that we need to get on with Brexit now by getting behind this deal.”\u0026nbspIt comes as Ms May was accused of\u0026nbspcaving\u0026nbspin to Spain’s demands for concessions over the future of the British overseas territory of Gibraltar.The prime minister said she would always “stand by” citizens of the Rock.European Union leaders will meet to debate Ms May’s Brexit deal on Sunday as MPs\u0026nbspwere warned by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, that rejecting it would cause “economic chaos”.One Labour MP branded the letter an “utter work of fiction”.Ian Murray, MP for Edinburgh South, said: “This letter is an utter work of fiction, and shows just how desperate the prime minister has become.“The people of Scotland and Britain won’t buy this deal, no matter how hard she tries to sell it.“It’s incredible that Theresa May is repeating lies about NHS spending, putting our economy at risk, and threatening the very future of the United Kingdom she once claimed was ‘precious’ to her.“There is simply no parliamentary majority for this deal, because it is the worst of both worlds. The only campaign which has momentum is the campaign for a people’s vote with the option of remaining in the EU.May’s ‘letter to the nation’ in fullWhen I became your prime minister the United Kingdom had just voted to leave the European Union.From my first day in the job, I knew I had a clear mission before me – a duty to fulfil on your behalf: to honour the result of the referendum and secure a brighter future for our country by negotiating a good Brexit deal with the EU.Throughout the long and complex negotiations that have taken place over the last year and a half, I have never lost sight of that duty.Today, I am in Brussels with the firm intention of agreeing a Brexit deal with the leaders of the other 27 EU nations.It will be a deal that is in our national interest – one that works for our whole country and all of our people, whether you voted ‘Leave’ or ‘Remain’.It will honour the result of the referendum.We will take back control of our borders, by putting an end to the free movement of people once and for all.Instead of an immigration system based on where a person comes from, we will build one based on the skills and talents a person has to offer.We will take back control of our money, by putting an end to vast annual payments to the EU.Instead, we will be able to spend British taxpayers’ money on our own priorities, like the extra £394m per week that we are investing in our long-term plan for the NHS.And we will take back control of our laws, by ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK.In future, our laws will be made, interpreted and enforced by our own courts and legislatures.We will be out of EU programmes that do not work in our interests: out of the Common Agricultural Policy, that has failed our farmers, and out of the Common Fisheries Policy, that has failed our coastal communities.Instead, we will be able to design a system of agricultural support that works for us and we will be an independent coastal state once again, with full control over our waters.The deal also protects the things we value.EU citizens who have built their lives in the United Kingdom will have their rights protected, as will UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU.A free trade area will allow goods to flow easily across our borders, protecting the many skilled jobs right across the country that rely on integrated supply-chains.Because our European friends will always be our allies in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the deal will ensure that security co-operation will continue, so we can keep our people safe.As prime minister of the United Kingdom, I have from day one been determined to deliver a Brexit deal that works for every part of our country – for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, for our Overseas Territories like Gibraltar, and also for the Crown Dependencies.This deal will do that.Crucially, it will protect the integrity of our United Kingdom and ensure that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland – so people can live their lives as they do now.It is a deal for a brighter future, which enables us to seize the opportunities that lie ahead.Outside the EU, we will be able to sign new trade deals with other countries and open up new markets in the fastest-growing economies around the world.With Brexit settled, we will be able to focus our energies on the many other important issues facing us here at home: keeping our economy strong, and making sure every community shares in prosperity securing our NHS for the future, giving every child a great start in life, and building the homes that families need tackling the burning injustices that hold too many people back, and building a country for the future that truly works for everyone.On 29 March next year, the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.We will then begin a new chapter in our national life.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

She will meet Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Saturday, and then head to the full meeting at around 9am on Sunday. The whole thing should be wrapped up by lunchtime – if it goes to plan (and things often do not). Here’s all you need to know about it:What is the summit about?Theresa May is hoping that EU leaders from the 27 remaining countries will sign off the withdrawal agreements she has negotiated with Brussels.\u0026nbspThe UK government is happy with the current agreement, as is the European Commission – which has been directly negotiating with Britain. Now the 27 leaders will have to formally approve it.Could they reject the agreement?If they show up at the summit, they almost certainly won’t be rejecting the agreement. This is because some national leaders, including Angela Merkel, have said they won’t attend unless there is a deal ready for them to sign. The summit is essentially for show to cap the whole thing off.The heads of state and government want to avoid all-nighters like the ones they experienced during the Greek debt crisis, and think negotiations are best delegated to officials.Is this the first time member states have seen the Brexit deal?No, their officials and ambassadors in Brussels have been arguing about it for days and trying to make changes. It currently seems likely that there will be a number of “side-declarations” next to the deal clarifying aspects of it that the member states wanted to change.A lot of member states – Denmark, France and the Netherlands especially –\u0026nbspare annoyed that the Commission has not guaranteed their fishing fleets access to UK waters as part of the deal. They think this is important because the Northern Ireland backstop essentially gives the UK the benefits of the EU customs union, which was supposed to be a bargaining chip. It\u0027s possible this issue could be solved by a so-called side-declaration where leaders make clear how they think the agreement should be interpreted.Spain is also angry because it does not want the agreement to apply to Gibraltar and says it will vote against the plan. It can\u0027t stop it on its own, though if the fishing nations aren\u0027t satisfied, there could be trouble.Who will we hear from at the summit?Leaders will give their views on the deal on the way in, on the doorstep of the summit. Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and Council president Donald Tusk will give a press conference after everything is signed off. Theresa May might also give a press conference of her own, though this has not been confirmed. There\u0027ll also be a presentation by European Parliament president Antoni Tajani.Does this mean Brexit negotiations are over?Far from it. Once the withdrawal agreement is approved there will need to be negotiations about what the trade relationship will be. These will start next March, if everything goes to plan, and they will take years.\u0026nbspBut even if EU leaders agree to the withdrawal agreement it could still get rejected by the UK parliament, with MPs\u0026nbspfrom all parties threatening to derail it when it comes to the House of Commons.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

attended\u0026nbspthe Exposition Universelle in Paris, where he demonstrated his device by recording the voice of Austrian emperor Franz Josef - our earliest surviving magnetic recording - taking home the Grand Prix for his trouble.He followed this breakthrough with the invention of the first continuous wave transmitter in 1903, dubbed the Poulsen\u0026nbspArc, which would be used in the earliest radio broadcasting stations and enabled\u0026nbspcommunication between Lyngby\u0026nbspin the Copehagen suburbs and Newcastle in the UK, effectively bridging the North Sea\u0026nbspwith the aid

This is the people’s disappointment in the DPP,” he said, citing slower-than-expected initiatives that have drawn criticism including pension and justice reforms.Votes were still being counted in Taiwan’s affluent capital, Taipei, where the incumbent mayor Ko Wen-je, an independent, is in a close race with the Kuomintang’s Ting Shou-chung, and the DPP is running a distant third.Kaohsiung’s Kuomintang mayor-elect, Han Kuo-yu, who described the city as “outdated and poor” while on the campaign trail, told a rally he would go all-out to boost its economy.“We must immediately roll up our sleeves and get to work,” Mr Han said, speaking of what was once one of the world’s busiest ports but which has lost much of its business to China.There was no immediate reaction from Beijing to the poll results, where state media simply noted Ms Tsai’s resignation as party chairwoman “to take responsibility for the party’s performance in Taiwan’s local elections”.A spokesperson for the US\u0026nbspState Department praised Taiwan for “demonstrating the strength of their vibrant democratic system through a successful round of elections”.Taiwan television stations reported a high turnout, with some polling stations in parts of Taipei and Kaohsiung remaining open past 4pm (8am GMT) when the polls were due to close.Candidates fanned out across the island to shake hands and canvass votes, and held noisy, colourful rallies that have become the hallmarks of Taiwan’s vibrant democracy, in marked contrast to China where the Communist Party tolerates no dissent to its rule.Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have heightened, with China conducting military drills around the island and snatching away Taiwan’s dwindling number of diplomatic allies.\u0026nbspMs Tsai’s domestic reform initiatives, from the island’s pension scheme to labour law, have also come under intense voter scrutiny recently.Confidence in the government has waned in recent months after reform moves upset both the opposition and some supporters, who said Ms Tsai had backed away from promises to reduce the deficit and cut pollution.Underscoring Ms Tsai’s challenge are a series of public votes also held on Saturday on whether to make same-sex marriage legal, an issue which has deeply ided Taiwan.Voters looked set to back a referendum defining marriage as between and a man and a woman, dealing a sharp blow to Taiwan’s position as a bastion of liberalism in Asia.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from the 2018 Taipei Gay Pride March in Taiwan Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Participants take part in the 2018 Taipei Gay Pride March in Taipei, Taiwan, 27 October 2018.Thousands of people attended the march in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan.Participants walk in the parade.The march took place ahead of a landmark vote next month on LGBT+ rights in Taiwan.On May 24 2017, the Constitutional Court in Taiwan ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry in the state.After making its ruling on same-sex marriage in May last year, the court stated that its decision must be implemented in two years.On November 24, a public vote will be held in Taiwan on same-sex marriage.A participant of the march poses next to a wedding studio.A young woman from Chongqing in mainland China holds a fan reading free writers before the start of the march.Participants with Pikachu-styled costumes pose as they gather at the square outside the presidential office for the start of the march.Thousands took part in the parade in support of same-sex marriage.Participants in the square outside the presidential office before the start of the parade.A couple take part in the march with their baby.Members of Tokyo Rainbow Pride walk in the parade.The parade was awash with rainbow-coloured paraphernalia.A participant of the march poses with a fan.A participant from Japan holds a banner before the start of the march.A person taking part in the march waves a rainbow flag.A man, decorated with balloons and a rainbow flag, takes part in the celebrations.An American man and his Japanese partner, both wearing headbands saying \u0027Japan\u0027 in Japanese, kiss each other during the march.Thousands of people attended the annual march.Taiwan gay rights activist Chi Chia-wei attends the march.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” Irish officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom. Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004512383321.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may woolly brexit deal","story":"But it is still just a woolly and even contradictory wishlist that barely binds Brussels to anything.The cost of these vague promises  Some  thousand million pounds.This “political declaration” about the future is predicated on Brussels negotiating a trade deal in good faith, a ­quality they have never shown since the referendum result they are even now desperate to overthrow.Why would their puerile desire to “punish” Britain abate once we nominally leave next March Especially when under the terms now agreed they can trap us in the Customs Union for ever The PM claims the EU wouldn’t want us there, benefiting from it for free, having ended free movement. But that’s a price Brussels will surely pay to cripple us as a trading rival on their doorstep.That said, the deal is NOT all bad.Downing Street rightly trumpets that it ends free movement and our massive membership subscription, protects jobs and secures our fishing rights .And Mrs May, to her considerable credit, pushed the EU into an extraordinary U-turn over a high-tech solution to police the Irish border. Remember how glibly they once sneered at that idea Trouble is, who trusts them not to change heart againthe appalling “Irish backstop” alternative suits them The trade deal may take years. Anyone could veto it: Spain over Gibraltar. Or the Belgian Walloons who almost wrecked the EU Canada deal. We would be stuck.And while Mrs May’s deal enshrines our right to an independent trade policy, it also says any new partnership with the EU must “build on” a single customs territory.That’s why Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab quit — it ­scuppers any deals where.The one straw we clutch is that Jeremy Corbyn isn’t negotiating.None of his scripted lines, nor his brow furrowed in supposed concentration, can hide that the entire debate sails over his head.Don’t imagine the chaos couldn’t be worse.WE heartily approve of primary kids being tasked with damming streams, canoeing and playing conkers.Sure, it’s a bit Swallows And Amazons.

Securing a general election is the only thing that matters to them.Jeremy Corbyn is showing scant regard for statesmanship and putting our country’s best interests a poor second to sheer tribal and selfish ambition.I will tell you one thing about Theresa May: No one can say she is putting herself through this for personal political ambition.Hers has been a tormented week of continued public duty and personal, selfless service.Stoic and steadfast, the Prime Minister has shown a resilience seen rarely in politics, probably last admired when another woman ran the country.The stance of Arlene Foster’s DUP is carelessly irresponsible in the extreme.A lot of the “backstop” stuff and the — unacceptable in my view — possibility of the EU being able to block our exit, has been caused by a bona fide effort from May to accommodate the DUP’s wishes.For me, it has been an interesting week in another way as well.I have presided over the board meetings of several of the six private companies I have the honour to chair.Dferent sizes, dferent sectors, dferent parts of the country, yet they are all saying the same things. That business is doing fine. Not what the doomsayers want to hear, but true. It is hard work but certainly not Armageddon.Companies up and down the land are demanding a diet of “boring, stable predictability”. It means they can invest more cash and employ more people. It is uncertainty that kills us.I am hearing from boardrooms that the Brexit proposal is fine, with one big caveat.On the plus side, a Single Market for manufactured goods will work.Anyone selling into the EU — yes, even China and Trump’s USA — has to abide by EU regulation.“Taking it” from Berlin, er, Brussels in this area is not a problem whatever ideologues may say. It secures hundreds of thousands of jobs and tax revenues.The proposed deal means business will be free to recruit essential immigrant labour on the basis of their skill and not where they come from.Choosing from a global, not just an EU, pool of talent is so, so helpful and will assist our international competitiveness hugely.But the one message ringing through my ears is, “Get on with it.”Regardless of whether a business is in Birmingham or Barcelona, Sunderland or Stuttgart, the wealth-creators of Europe, the payers of the tax that builds schools and hospitals, the job-providers just want their politicians to stop this rowing now.Stop the bullying, Berlin stop the rowing, Tories stop the naked, tribal, selfish manoeuvring, Labour — and just do it.One big caveat: You cannot expect anyone in our country — businesswoman or a guy on the line alike — to accept a deal that gives Jean-Claude Juncker’s lot the final say on when, indeed,we leave. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team have bullied us enough.While there are a million dferent beliefs on what the majority of Brits voted for in the referendum, one thing is certain: They DID vote to leave.Giving the EU the final yes no on that is unacceptable and surely no deal is better than that.No deal means no £billion to the unelected, unaccountable Eurocrats. No deal means fewer jobs in troubled Germany and faltering France.Yes, it would be harder for UK business for sure. But not fatal. There would be a price to pay, but whoever said freedom does not come at a price There was one other thing businesses were clear on at my meetings last week.The quicker this country understands there is a greater threat to prosperity, jobs, tax revenues and a successful economy than Brexit, the better.A Corbyn government would turn this country into Venezuela in short order talent and capital would leave so quickly that John McDonnell would have nothing left punitively to tax.The message from small business is as clear as it is strong.The Conservatives, Liberals, big business and the establishment must stop obsessing about Brexit and focus on the greatest threat this country has faced for decades.And that is a bunch of extreme hard-Left business-haters who would ruin this great country and probably blame their abject failure on Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t think No. are involved in this.“Some of the people who are thinking beyond that are pretty senior people. Serious people.”Figures in the party – who prop up Mrs May’s minority government – issued a stark warning at the annual rally in Belfast yesterday.When asked whether MPs should back her Brexit plan or her, the source said: “Well do you think most Tory MPs would bring on a general election, bring on not being able to put anything through Parliament ”The source added: “Theresa May, whoever it is, needs to take a dferent approach. They will have our support in taking a dferent approach.”The talks are understood to include creating a permanent customs arrangement – which would enrage Eurosceptic Tory MPs.The revelation comes after Philip Hammond flew to Belfast on Friday night and held talks with DUP leader Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds, her deputy at Westminster.Mr Dodds told his partys rally that the Union of the UK was non-negotiable and his party would stand firm under pressure to support the deal.In a dire warning to Tory rebels, Philip Hammond spelled out the “very serious” consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement.He said Britain would be in “uncharted territory”the PM’s deal collapses, with “signicant job losses and mass disruption across the land.But his grim scenarios were dismissed by leading Brexiteers as the re-emergence of Project Fear, the doom-laden predictions peddled during the referendum campaign which turned out to be unfounded.Mr Hammond’s intervention is aimed at winning over critics including more than  Conservative MPs - from both the Leave and Remain sides - who are threatening to vote against the agreement.Astonishingly, the arch-Remainer said the deal on offer was BETTER for the UK than staying in the EU, saying it would help heal the isions caused by Brexit.He also sought to reassure the DUP over their “understandable concerns” about the Northern Ireland backstop provisions aimed at preventing a hard border with Ireland.Mr Hammond told the BBC: “It’s a way of leaving the European Union with minimum negative impact on our economy.“Economics is not the only consideration - we also have to look at the political healing process, bringing our country back together because countries that are disunited and ided are not successful countries.“If we want this country to be successful in the future, we have got to bring it back together after this process.”He warned that a no-deal Brexit would unleash “economic chaos”, adding: “If the meaningful vote is lost we are in uncharted territory. We will be faced with potential economic chaos I am sure we would get a very negative reaction from the business community, from investors, from the markets.He added that “we might end up with no deal, we might end up with no Brexit”the Withdrawal Agreement is blocked by Parliament.If the deal does pass the Commons, the repercussions could bring down Mrs May’s government, with the DUP hinting at withdrawing the support of its MPs.He claimed the current deal would keep the UK locked in a EU straightjacket.He also joked that the only person with job security at Number  was Larry the Cat.Arlene Foster, leader of the DUP, yesterday said the DUP must “look beyond” the current Brexit blueprint for an “improved outcome”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was really shell-shocked.”It seems like such a simple admission. But the reality is that with most celebrities, from the Kardashians to the Beckhams, projecting an unfeasibly perfect image of parenthood as part of their brand, many expectant mums think a new baby is going to be a walk in the park.The reality for most of us really couldn’t be further from the truth.Paloma also talked about the dficulty of balancing being a new mother with having a career.“I found it very dficult, the pull between wanting to be the greatest mother ever but also trying to sustain an inherently selfish career,” she said.The transition from being a woman with a career and all the time in the world to a mother wanting to continue working is no easy feat.There’s a period of adjustment and, often, the road is rocky. So here’s the reality, for what it’s worth.In my experience, EVERY woman who is a parent finds motherhood hard at some point or ­another, but especially at the beginning. And the women who seem to be sailing through it are often putting on a brave face, partly because they feel under pressure to do so.Often, people’s public portrayal of their le, including motherhood, is heavily edited, airbrushed and ­censored.The pressure on women for everything, including motherhood, to be “perfect” is clear.And,that isn’t your experience, with everyone  seemingly acing it, the pressure is on to pretend that it is.The vicious cycle is born. So it’s brave of Paloma to talk about her experience out loud.Given that every mum in the history of the universe has felt this way about motherhood at one time or another, we should be more honest about admitting it to be true.Modern pressures are making it so dficult I have to say I’m so glad I’m not raising a child today.The internet had still not been invented. The Twitter and Instagram inventors had probably not even been born.When I was growing up the only “influencers” in my le were my mum and dad.We ate as a family every night and there were three channels on the TV that all stopped airing by midnight. You had to make your own entertainment.Nowadays you can’t move for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter telling your kids how they should look or feel — and ­promoting lestyles that are simply unattainable.No wonder there has been such a dramatic rise in young people self-harming and taking anti- depressants.

Because it IS bloody hard.So good for Paloma for being honest and fighting the tide of propaganda about motherhood.Because being honest makes it easier for other women who might be struggling.ISN’T it incredible to think that a hundred years ago, on November , , women were allowed to stand for parliament in the UK for the very first time Fast forward to the  General Election when  female MPs were elected.Yes, that’s in relation to  male MPs, so we still have a way to go – but look how far we have come.I know I am biased, but women are such a brilliant parliamentary asset.Look at all the things they bring to the table and to the conversation.Women are great listeners, good mediators, brilliant diplomats and inspiring promoters of family and equal rights. Oh, and we are resilient.Just look at Theresa May who, at a time when most men would be hiding under the duvet and emitting a high-pitched wailing noise, is rising to the unbelievable challenges being thrown at her by the Brexit process – and enjoying beans on toast with her husband Philip in the evening.Compare her to a politician such as Jacob Rees-Mogg who is doing everything he possibly can to promote himself and his political ambitions – rather than focusing on what the country needs.The PM is the living embodiment of resilience – a tough old bird indeed.ANYONE in a long-term marriage should take note of Dolly Parton’s insights on what makes her -year union work.“When people ask me what’s the key to my long marriage and lasting love, I always say, ‘Stay gone’,” the singer, reveals. “I travel a lot, but we really enjoy each other when we’re together and the little things we do.”Her husband Carl doesn’t like to appear in public or walk the red carpet – so she leaves him at home.Instead of glamorous date nights, they take trips in a “little camper”, go on picnics and eat at local restaurants, including a drive-thru McDonald’s.But eventhey are having a quiet night in, she says she always makes sure she is “fixed up for him because I don’t believe in going home and being a slouch”.You’ve got to love Dolly.NOT many people can ooze class, charm and elegance with their leg raised higher than their head – at the age of .Butthere’s one woman who can, it’s the glorious Darcey Bussell, who must be one of the nicest, and classiest, women in showbiz today.Goldman was one of the first corporate firms to introduce “lactation rooms” for women to express milk and it also runs free prenatal fitness classes at its office gym.It also has on-site day care where employees’ children are cared for  days per year for free.All of which is great – and let’s hope more companies follow suit for new parents.Mind you, it’s not like the need for childcare ever really stops – I still need an emergency nanny occasionally when my -year-old daughter loses her keys or my -year-old son locks himself out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As things stand, the PM knows she faces defeat when the deal comes before the Commons next month as enemies on all sides gang up on her. So she’s written an open letter to the British people imploring voters to put pressure on wavering MPs to back her. She hopes it might just give her the numbers she needs to get her Brexit through and reunite a warring nation. She wrote: “We will then begin a new chapter in our national le. I want that to be a moment of renewal and reconciliation for our whole country. “It must put aside the labels of ‘Leave’ and ‘Remain’ for good and we come together again as one people.To do that we need to get on with Brexit now by getting behind this deal.”  Mrs May is to launch a new website today to sell her deal. She will tour the country, and blitz social media in what Whitehall dubbed “the air war”. The PM is set to get backing today from all  EU states at the special summit in Brussels.EU Council president Donald Tusk urged leaders to support the plan, telling them: “No-one has reasons to be happy. But we were all looking for a good and fair agreement. “And I believe we have finally found the best possible compromise.” He even quoted Freddie Mercury on the th anniversary of the singer’s death, tweeting: “Friends will be friends – right till the end”, saying it should be the summit motto.  Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez tried to throw a last minute spanner in the works over Gibraltar’s future.But pressure from other EU leaders, including Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, persuaded him to not carry out a summit boycott. In a classic face-saving fudge, Mr Sanchez said the UK had provided “sufficient guarantees to reach a solution to a conflict that has lasted more than  years”. # In fact, all the UK has promised is that a future EU-UK trade treaty would not automatically apply to Gibraltar. That will be rubber-stamped by other leaders. Mrs May said Gibraltar was “covered by the whole withdrawal agreement” and its sovereignty “will not change”. Britain is adamant its , citizens will stay British as long as they want.  EU leaders were furious with Sanchez for trying to mess up today’s summit.They accused him of trying to win votes for regional elections in Andalusia, next to Gibraltar. The summit will approve two documents – a withdrawal agreement set in stone and a political declaration on the UK’s future relationship with the EU. Jeremy Corbyn branded this “ pages of waffle” containing only vague shyaspirations and accused Mrs May of a “blindfold Brexit”.  But in a bid to placate MPs, No sources said although the declaration wording cannot be changed “clarications” may be added. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson pitched up in Belfast at the DUP’s annual conference to rubbish Mrs May’s plans. He told leader Arlene Foster and delegates the Irish border backstop should be “junked” and said Mrs May’s Brexit deal will turn Northern Ireland into an EU “economic semi-colony”. The  DUP MPs say they will not back Mrs May at next month’s vote unless she scraps proposals that could align Northern Ireland with EU rules after Brexit. The DUP says that would effectively carve Northern Ireland off from the UK. But Mr Johnson did urge unionists to honour their Westminster deal propping up the Tories. He warned the alternative would be a Labour government led by Mr Corbyn “whose avowed policy is to break up this country.” Mr Johnson said under current plans Northern Ireland would have to accept EU rules from “lawnmower noise, the labelling of sardines, to the use of recreational watercraft.” He added: “Nowhere has a more illustrious history than Northern Ireland when it comes to the creation of recreational watercraft. The Titanic springs to mind, and now is the time to point out the iceberg ahead.” Mrs May’s appeal to the nation will be her most personal yet. No spin doctors aim to bury her Maybot image from last year’s election. In the letter, she says: “From my first day in the job, I knew I had a clear mission before me – a duty to honour the result of the referendum. “Throughout the long and complex negotiations I have never lost sight of that duty.” So what will happen next  THE FIRST VOTE The PM holds the so-called Commons “meaningful vote” on her Brexit deal on December . And it really is D-Day for the PM. IF SHE WINS the UK leaves the EU on March  next year as planned, and she stays on as Prime Minister until . IF SHE LOSES Labour tables a vote of no confidence in the Tory Government. Mrs May has  days to win a second confidence voteshe loses the first one. If she fails to win then a General Election should follow  days later. But as that clashes with Christmas it would be held in January. But Jeremy Corbyn could win a confidence vote of his own and become PM – see Nigel Nelson, Page . THE SECOND VOTE If Mrs May does not quit, get thrown out or get forced into a General Election in round one, she may cling on for a second vote. This would involve coming back to Parliament with a better deal from Brussels, or as an emergency measure in the certainty of the pound crashing. IF SHE WINS the UK leaves the EU on March  as planned and she stays on as Prime Minister until . IF SHE LOSES this one she would surely resign rather than face another round of confidence votes. Chancellor Philip Hammond would become interim Prime Minister while the Tories hold a leadership contest. Mr Corbyn could win a confidence vote of his own and become Prime Minister instead. THE THIRD VOTE Having rejected Mrs May’s Brexit deal, it would be up to MPs to decide what to do next. They could accept no deal but this is unlikely. So they would have little option but to opt for no Brexit. That means voting to withdraw Article  to keep us in the EU while a new strategy is worked out. A second referendum is now the most likely outcome.

They were a young family living in the sunshine state of Queensland, Australia. Even though they weren’t legally married, they’d been together  years and, in Australia, that established them as being in a de facto relationship – meaning when it came to property and finances, they had the legal rights of a married couple. Louis was a former police officer who had left the service in  when the family moved back to Charleville, the town where the couple had first met all those years ago. Louis, , took a job as a supervisor in a meat abattoir and the couple raised their daughter together. But tragedy was about to strike. On Sunday August , , Louis called emergency services from his home, sounding distressed. He said he’d been in the house, where his daughter was having a nap, when he heard a thud. He’d gone outside and found Lainie, , at the bottom of a large gum tree in their garden. Louis said it looked like Lainie had fallen off a ladder while taking down party lights, and was unconscious on the ground with a head wound. He couldn’t find a pulse. When paramedics arrived, Louis’ black utility vehicle was backed up to the tree. A ladder was propped up on the back of the vehicle. Lainie was on the ground below with a serious injury to the back of her head. Around the base of the tree were large rocks, which she could have struck on her fall. Medics battled to save her and she was rushed to hospital.   A nurse noted that the wound in the back of her head was big enough ‘to put her fist in’. The lights had been in the tree for years – why had Lainie chosen to take them down that day  Her injury was devastating and, after two days, her loved ones reluctantly agreed to turn off her le support. The freak accident had left Dakota without a mum, and Louis a widower – potentially a wealthy one. Louis was entitled to their assets, including another property, and just two days after losing Lainie, Louis made a claim for her le insurance. Just months before her death, two policies worth .million AUSin total were taken out. The insurance company was suspicious about the claim and put a hold on Louis receiving the money. While he argued his case, they informed police of their doubts – but the coroner had determined Lainie’s cause of death to be accidental. Their hands were tied. But Sergeant Gerry Thornton felt drawn to investigate the case. He was based  miles away in another district but he happened to be visiting Charleville on the day of the accident and had driven by Lainie’s house. The ladder was still on the vehicle, leaning against the large tree. The Sergeant knew right away that something didn’t look right. For starters, he could see that it would be almost impossible for Lainie to climb the rungs without it slipping away from her at the very start. Sergeant Thornton was convinced that Lainie’s death was no accident and he kept working on the case. He kept digging until the case was reopened in . Louis had plenty of secrets and it seemed Lainie had caught him out. He was unfaithful. He used his position as supervisor at the meat works to arrange trips to meet a Korean woman he’d met through the business. He used company expenses so Lainie wouldn’t find out – but she knew.   Lainie had confided in her mum that she had an STD but the only man she’d been with was Louis. He had to be cheating on her, possibly with several women and she wasn’t going to put up with it. She withdrew money from their account, around , AUS , and told friends she was going to leave. Louis always swore to people that no one would ever take his daughter from him. Had he found out about her plans  On his laptop, there were internet searches on subjects such as poisoning, car crashes and head injuries. Louis had also been looking up romantic getaways after Lainie’s death and even on the day of her funeral he’d been looking for a holiday with his lover. While Louis had been ‘grieving’, he kept changing his story about the day she died. He told friends that he’d panicked and didn’t know what to do – while he told another that he was thankful for his police training because he knew what to do in the situation. He told some people he’d given mouth-to-mouth, but others claim he said he couldn’t because of the leaves and dirt around Lainie’s mouth. He seemed to be enjoying being the centre of attention. The biggest anomaly was the most obvious. Lainie’s injuries just weren’t consistent with an estimated fall of around five metres. There were no broken ribs, other abrasions, or any other organs injured as there should have been from a drop from a ladder.   Lainie didn’t even have leaves or debris on her at the hospital. Louis also said he’d found her face down so how had she got such a massive wound to the back of her head  Investigators started to look back at the photos taken at the scene of the accident. In one image, a rusted antique iron could be seen lying at the bottom of the tree in the rocks. There was blood at the base of it, yet that part was face down. The iron hadn’t been collected at the time and, mysteriously, it had since vanished. It was determined that the iron was a fit for the indent on Lainie’s head. Shockingly, the realisation dawned that Louis had delivered the fatal blow to his we’s head then staged the scene to make it look like she’d died in an unfortunate accident. With his knowledge of crime scenes, it would have come naturally to him. Seven years after Lainie’s death, in December , Louis was arrested. He told police that they’d be buying him drinks soon to apologise for the mistake they’d made. But his ego wasn’t going to save him from facing a jury. He was charged with Lainie’s murder. In , Louis went to trial after pleading not guilty. The prosecution said that the single wound on Lainie’s head wasn’t consistent with the fall that Louis said had happened.   They suggested that Louis had killed his we knowing that she was going to leave him. He’d most likely struck her with the missing iron then staged the scene. ‘We say that scene was a construct of Louis Mahoney,’ they told the court. Engineers testied that it was unlikely that Lainie could have climbed the ladder to the tree without it falling out from under her – and yet when medics arrived, it was still leant against the tree. Her body was also on the opposite side of the tree to the ladder. Lainie’s mum Patricia said that her daughter suspected Louis was having an affair and wanted to leave him. She’d planned on moving to their other property at Dundee Beach near Darwin and she intended on taking Dakota. Something witnesses testied that Louis had repeatedly said he would never let happen. In November , Louis, , was found guilty and cries of ‘yes’ were heard around the court room. At the sentencing, Laine’s niece, Georgia Grant, made a statement saying how the murder had devastated their tight knit family. In the weeks after her death, Dakota had asked where her mummy was and when she was told that she was now an angel, she’d replied, ‘I don’t want an angel, I want my mummy.’ Louis was sentenced to le in prison and will be eligible for parole in  years. Lainie’s family praised the determination of Sergeant Thornton who had made sure that justice was served all those years after Lainie had died. Louis had finally been exposed as the greedy, lying adulterer that he was. Sadly, when Lainie discovered what he was really like, she paid with her le before she could escape.

With the Star of David flag flying from their handlebars, these were no ordinary bikers: most of the group had travelled , miles from Tel Aviv, spending  days sailing across the Mediterranean sea, then winding their way through the roads of Europe. The group was made up of physicists, farmers, surgeons and businessmen, but one thing united them – they were all holocaust survivors, or the children of survivors. ‘Riding up to Auschwitz was an incredibly emotional feeling,’ says Joe Gottdenker. ‘To do it with the Star of David flag was indescribable, knowing that more than a million Jews were murdered inside those gates…’ In a time when anti-Semitism and populist movements are on the rise in Europe, Joe and his fellow riders were on a mission to remind people of the horrors that recent history holds. Driving across nine countries, the bikers made several emotional stops at concentration camps and Third Reich sites such as the Brandenburg Gate, before completing their journey at the Waldbuumlhne Stadion, where Hitler held his infamous  Berlin Olympics.   For holocaust survivor Joe, the journey was particularly poignant. Joe’s family had been wealthy, running a sawmill that employed  local people in their small town of Mielec, Poland. When the Nazis invaded in , they stormed the sawmill and declared that it was the property of the Third Reich. ‘For the next three years, my uncles and brothers continued to run the sawmill, but all profits were forcibly turned over to the Nazis,’ says Joe. ‘But in , when my mother was pregnant with me, the Nazis rounded up all the Jewish men of Mielec in the town square. They separated them into two groups: anyone fit and healthy, between the ages of -, was sent to be a slave labourer in a local aircraft factory. The elderly, infirm, and injured were taken into the forest and shot dead in a mass execution.’ Joe’s father and uncles were among the men taken to the factory. His mother Bina had managed to obtain a fake ID that claimed she was a gentileand she fled to Sandomierz, a town about  miles away, where a Catholic family called the Ziołos gave her and her unborn baby shelter. Joe was born on the family’s farm in , a playmate for their -year-old son Tadeusz. ‘Words cannot express the bravery this family showed,’ says Joe. ‘Hiding a Jewish person was an offence punishable by death. Petronela and Władysław are my saviours – they were a little bright light in a very, very dark time.’   Petronela and Władysław, who had met Bina by chance only a few months before, pretended that Bina and Joe were visiting family members, but, as the war raged, tensions began to rise further. Thousands of Jewish people were being rounded up and taken to concentration camps daily, and homes were regularly raided by the Gestapo looking for Jews being sheltered in cellars and backrooms. When Bina saw an anti-Semetic classmate in the town centre, she began to panic. All it would take was a single whisper to the Gestapo, and the Ziołos, Bina and Joe would face certain death. ‘My mother had to make an unimaginable choice,’ says Joe. ‘She had to battle her maternal instincts and leave her newborn baby, or risk bringing death to the family. She fled, joining the Underground Partisans, a resistance movement living in the forest. She could have no contact with me, and had no idea whether I was even alive.’ For the next three and a half years, Petronela and Władysław brought Joe up ashe were their own son, keeping up the pretence that he was a Catholic relative from another town who had been abandoned by his family. By caring for Joe, they put their lives in constant danger, and even their son Tadeusz was unaware of the truth. ‘At one point, they wanted to relocate me to their cousin’s home in another town,’ says Joe. ‘Shortly before I was to move, the cousin’s neighbours were found to be hiding Jews and the entire Polish family, as well as the Jews, were shot in the front yard of their own home. So they kept me hidden on the farm.’   Joe has few memories from his time on the farm, but the few he has feature a warm and kindly family. ‘I remember Petronela going out into the barn and milking the cows,’ Joe recalls. ‘I’d sit there watching her and she would playfully direct a spray of milk into my face, then a cat would come over and lick my face. I can still taste the warm sweet milk coming right from the cow. It wasn’t anything like being in the concentration camps, but I was somewhat malnourished and suffered from rickets from living off potatoes. The first time I was given an orange I tried to bounce it!’ Across Europe, millions of Joe’s race were being slaughtered by the Third Reich. When the Aircraft Factory where his uncles and father were working was bombed by the Allies, they were moved to a concentration camp where they survived by sticking together. By the time the war finished, an estimated six million Jewish people had been murdered by the Nazis. Around the world, the death toll is thought to be between  and  million. Many members of Joe’s own family were killed or missing, but somehow, his father and two uncles survived and escaped to Germany. His mother ed to Ziołos’ farm, with no idea whether her boy was still alive. But they were reunited, and it washys a confusing time for Joe, who’d only ever known Petronela as his mother. ‘Despite the war being over, Poland was still a very dangerous place,’ says Joe. ‘The Iron Curtain was coming down and Jews were being killed by Poles. My uncle Dave was brave enough to come back into Poland and rescue me and my mother.’   The family spent three years in Germany, living as displaced persons. Readjusting to le was dficult, and Joe never heard a single word of what his mother and father had suffered during their separation. ‘Many holocaust survivors carry the trauma which runs deep, and this is passed onto their children,’ says Joe. ‘My parents never truly recovered from what they went through. Everything I know about that time, I learnt from my uncle Dave.’ The family were eventually granted visas for the US, and went on to settle in Canada. Joe became a successful entrepreneur, and now has three children and five grandchildren. Petronela and Władysław passed away several years ago but Joe keeps in touch with their grandchildren, who settled in Chicago. Petronela and Władysław were awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations for the bravery they showed in saving Joe and Bina’s lives, and for Joe, not a day goes past when he doesn’t think of what that family did for him. ‘I have no ideaI’d be here todayit were not for them,’ he says. ‘Their bravery was immense. When I revisited the site of their old farm, a neighbour – a teenager at the time I’d lived there – admitted she’d always known they were hiding a Jew. That’s when the extent of the risk they took really hit home.’ For Joe, the motorcycle ride through Europe was vital for remembering what the Jewish people went through in the last century. But it was also a truly personal journey: he passed through Mielec, and stopped at the site where his family were rounded up and separated he drove past the site of the old farm that had been his sanctuary and they passed the forests were his mother had lived with the Resistance. ‘For me, with all that is happening in Europe at the moment, there has never been a more important time to remember the horror of the holocaust,’ he says.You can hear more of Joe’s story in Back To Berlin, the documentary that follows  motorcyclists across Europe, at selected cinemas now.

Great-grandad Brian, an RAF veteran and former cabbie, has won a major gong for his punctuality, reliability and cheerful attitude. He started delivering curries three years ago after his we Margaret died and he has no plans to put his feet up. Brian – believed to be the oldest person in the country doing the job – said: “People think I should be sitting back watching telly but that’s not me. “I like to go out and about and meet people, not sit at home and stagnate. “People wonder how I still manage to run around delivering curries, but I feel just as fit as when I was . I’ll only retire when I get old enough.”  Brian started working for Kipling’s restaurant in Sowerby Bridge, near Halax, West Yorks, almost by chance. He was already known for going door to door with Yellow Pages and the restaurant askedhe could deliver menus. One night when he popped in for some a driver had rung in sick so he was askedhe could deliver meals too. Brian said: “So I said yes. That’s what I do. When someone says, ‘Can you do this for me ’ I’ll say yes and do it to the best of my ability. I’m lucky to be here and I want to make the most of my le.” Dad-of-four Brian was a senior aircraftman with the RAF in the s, serving as an air traffic controller during the volatile Suez Crisis. Later he worked as a TV engineer and then spent  years as a taxi driver – which taught him the streets of Halax so well he doesn’t need a satnav. His only fear is dogs after being bitten by an Alsatian and a cocker spaniel while delivering Yellow Pages.  He joked: “But I know I’m safe when I’m doing my takeaway deliveries shybecause the dogs won’t bite someone who’s bringing in food.” During last winter’s big Beast from the East freeze Brian, who drives his own car, came across a woman stranded in the snow with her young daughter. Their car had broken down and their phone was dead so Brian gave them a lt home. It was only as he was dropping them off he discovered it was the same address he was delivering to. The husband was initially angry that his food had taken so long to arrive – until he realised Brian had brought his we and child home safely. Last week Brian had a “fabulous” trip to The Savoy Hotel in London for the Just Eat British Takeaway Awards hosted by TV star David Walliams. He was crowned Best Delivery Driver to a standing ovation – and the delight of Kipling’s boss Mohammed Rafiq and manager Max Rehman, who were at the ceremony with him.

In fact finding a pet-friendly home was so dficult for Zoe, , and boyfriend Ben, they ended up moving towns rather than parting with their beloved tabby Rhaegar. The Cats Protection League says housing was one of the top five reasons pets were handed into its shelters in the past year. Less than half of private rented housing allows cats, research has found. Often, the reason is habit, with a third of landlords saying they followed a standard tenancy agreement template. It took the couple  months to find kitty-friendly digs, forcing them to move in with Zoe’s mum. They finally relocated to Lewes in East Sussex,  miles from where they wanted to be in Brighton.   Zoe said: “It was soul-destroying. We’d search every day and all the ads would say ‘no pets’. We’d explain we were a professional couple and our cat had never caused a problem but the answer was no. We looked at house shares, flats, houses. “In the end it wasn’t where we wanted to be, as it was away from our friends, but it was the only place that came up. “We live in constant fear that the landlord will sell up and we’ll be back to square one.” But not not all landlords view cats as a problem. Mandy Boylett, a landlord, from Yarm, North Yorks, said: “Cats have never caused me any concern.

Smitten Simon Frost, , could not believe his luck when he was matched with Eva – a young beauty who spoke of setting up home with him. But the woman in the pictures was really US porn star Briana Lee, , whose photo has been lted repeatedly by cheats for this very purpose. Grandad Simon turned to internet dating after his we of  years left him. He joined a website called Real Sex Contacts in February  and two months later was introduced to Eva, supposedly a hospital worker from Ghanaian capital Accra. She sent a picture, Simon fell in love and he was persuaded to part with more than pound,.   In an exchange of messages she even teased out information about his bank cards. But when the time came for them to meet in the UK in August this year, Eva didn’t show up and he has not heard from her since. Simon, from Soham, Cambs, said he was speaking out to stop others falling for the same scam. He said: “I genuinely believed the relationship was real. I don’t understand why anyone would treat me like that. I had good intentions and was looking for a genuine relationship. “It has put me off trying anything like this ever again. “I would rather be lonely than go through all of this trauma.” Simon said he and Eva had called each other “babe” and “husband” and talked of buying a house for a new le together. But she was spinning a web of lies to get him to part with his dosh.   She said she needed cash to get court documents so that she could access her father’s poundmillion inheritance which included a stash of gold. Simon sent pound, savings, pound, on credit cards and two pound, advances from payday loan company Amigo. He also paid pound, for Eva’s flight to the UK in August this year – when he expected her to repay him. But Eva failed to turn up and when he was unable to contact her it became clear he had been scammed. Simon said: “I was sold a complete sob story and was completely used. “I believed everything she said. I thought I’d be able to clear my debts and we’d be able to enjoy the money and buy a house together. “But she clearly had no intention of coming here. I was lonely, and I still am, and I was looking for company. Eva seemed genuine. But I was shyobviously an easy target.” The loans come with a huge  per cent interest rate and Simon now needs to pay pound a month for two years to clear his debts. His bank account is locked following suspicions over his transfers to Ghana – so his daughter is having to pay his bills. Diabetic Simon was so stressed that he contemplated suicide. He has reported the scam to police and Action Fraud. According to AF there were , reports of romance fraud last year as con artists pocketed poundmillion – an average of pound, from each victim.

Briana Lee’s picture was used without her knowledge – and not for the first time. She said: “Unfortunately I’ve heard this same story many times. “I’m terribly sorry this person took advantage of this old man. I’d suggest never sending large amounts of money to someone you’ve never met.” Briana is an adult model and web cam girl whose fans follow her online for saucy photos and cheeky tweets. But fraudsters have identied her as perfect bait to lure internet daters. And her famous selfies are being used on hundreds of profiles by women claiming to be aged anywhere between  and  and living in America, Canada, the UK, Germany, Italy, Israel, Ghana, Cameroon and South Africa. According to investigators at Action Fraud nearly  per cent of scam victims are left at a risk of bankruptcy. The organisation advises daters not to rush into an online relationship.

Speculation had grown that “a bit of tension” between Harry and brother William was behind the move. But the Sunday Mirror can reveal there is no brotherly falling-out, with royal sources rubbishing the claims.

Doria spent much of the summer with Harry and Meghan in the UK and was described by her son-in-law as “amazing”.

The vile attack on two cops in South London last Saturday was a case in point.Both officers needed hospital treatment for their injuries. The WPC had head injuries and her male colleague had a broken rib. So far, so shocking. But what made me gasp in shydisbelief was the realisation that a member of the public had whipped out his mobile phone and – rather than call  – had filmed the whole thing, along with what he imagined to be a jokey commentary, and then posted it online. “Oh, dear me,” chuckled the bystander. “He just kung fu-kicked her in the head! Look! I am getting this all live, boys and girls, I thought I’d just stop and have a little watch.” The poor policewoman was kicked so hard in the head she fell into the path of a passing bus and narrowly escaped being run over. Several arrests have been made and we are now waiting for justice to be done. But one person who won’t be in the dock any time soon is the moron who stood by and watched this carnage unfold asit were an episode of Line of Duty, asreal people weren’t being hurt and real lives weren’t at stake. Because apparently, he didn’t break any laws.  This is now something our emergency services are expected to just put up with. Asit weren’t traumatic enough to be the first responders to a horrible accident, or a killing or a suicide, they have to deal with idiots who think these are appropriate images to share on social media. So I’m not a bit surprised at the sad comments made by the Met Police Federation Chairman, Ken Marsh, who said that Britain’s “walk on by culture” had led him to conclude that officers might have to let violent thugs go free rather than even attempt to arrest them. This reminded me of a situation I was caught up in a few years ago. My husband Steve and I were on a bus travelling into town. It was a busy Saturday afternoon and the bus was packed with people. When it arrived at our stop we stood up to get off and right in front of our eyes a man grabbed the female driver, snatched her takings and ran down the street. Before I had a chance to even take a breath, Steve had leapt off the bus and chased the thief down the street, yelling: “Stop that man! Stop that man.”After a y chase, in which no one  lted a finger to help, he caught the man who dropped the cash and then fled when Steve stopped to pick it up. Fortunately, the police turned up at that point and arrested the thief. My point isn’t that my husband was a hero. It’s that his reaction to help was instinctive. He didn’t even think about it. And until recently I believed that most of us thought that way. Butthat attitude is dying out we need to think about adopting the sort of good Samaritan Law they have in Germany and many other European countries. In Germany it is a crime not to help others in danger and those found guilty can be fined or jailed for up to a year. And for those who compound the crime by posting evidence of their heartlessness on social media we should double the sentence. Let’s see how many “likes” they get then.

In the south east, Leigh Bell Wharf and Clacton Groyne , both in Essex, were found to be below par.  Other poor beaches included Weston-super-Mare , Burnham Jetty North, both in Somerset, and Combe Martin, Instow and Ilfracombe Wildersmouth, all of which are in Devon. The results may sound bad but they compare to just  per cent of beaches passing water quality tests in the early s.

Our sewers were built in the Victorian era and not designed to be blocked with plastic items, many of which we find on our beach cleans. “The main culprits we come across are cotton bud sticks – hundreds of them, wipes and tampon applicators. “It is vital to get the message across that we must not use our toilets as bins.”  Emma Howard Boyd, Chair of the Environment Agency, reportedly said:: Seaside tourism is worth over pound billion to the economy and good water quality is essential for people to visit and enjoy our beautul beaches.

Steph said that because of her earlier results, she was turned down - months before being given the bombshell news she had stage four cancer. Steph, from Wythenshawe, south Manchester, started chemotherapy last week. Her devastated family have vowed to help her fight the disease and are trying to raise funds to send Steph for alternative treatment abroad. Stephs loved ones are also urging other young women to insist on getting a smear test or a blood testthey present similar symptoms. Debra Nolan, Steph’s mum, told the Manchester Evening News: “She was given painkillers, they kept sending her home. No blood tests or smears took place. She asked for a smear. Her last smear was in , the results were all clear. But since then she had abnormal bleeding. They refused it as they said she is not due one.”   Steph, a nursery nurse, first started experiencing severe back pain after giving birth to her second baby, Blake, four years ago. When Blake was one, Steph collapsed from the pain in her back. She was rushed to AE in an ambulance, but says she was later discharged and told it was a slipped disc. The pain in her lower back continued and Steph attended numerous GP appointments. Each time she says she was sent home with more painkillers and told it was sciatica. She began to struggle to keep food and drink down around three months ago. Steph went to AE again, but says she was discharged with stronger painkillers. Her GP then diagnosed her with a cyst in her oies. Debra insisted Steph, also mum to Lola, six, go back to the doctors and ask for antibiotics. When she ed she says she was seen by a dferent doctor, who noticed she had a lot of swelling around her body. It was not until this point that Steph was given a blood test. The next day she was told her kidneys were only ing at eight per cent. She underwent an operation and surgeons discovered tumours inside the urethra tubes – caused by the spread of cervical cancer. Steph was officially diagnosed with cancer just four weeks ago. Debra, , said: “She is so brave, I am so proud of her. She is staying positive, we don’t get upset in front of her. I just want to be positive and fight it as much as I can.” The family are fundraising to send Steph for immunotherapy treatment, which is only available abroad, including in the USA and Germany. Friends have created an online fundraising page with a target of pound,, but more cash will be neededshe is accepted for treatment abroad. Fundraising events are taking place in Wythenshawe at The Cornishman pub, on December , and The Jolly Butcher, on December . Dozens of businesses have donated prizes, while friends are organising an ‘Elf on the Shelf’ style fundraiser using the hashtag #followelfie.

I’ve been very pleased with what we’ve seen from him so far.”Curran’s role has changed under the new manager after previous boss Neil McCann wanted to develop him into an attacking full-back.McIntyre, though, sees him further up the pitch where he can use his pace to hurt opposing teams more directly.Also able to play as a central midfielder, Curran’s versatility has its uses for a manager but Jim has urged the young Aussie to “nail down a position” to really fulfil the potential he sees in him.The Dens boss said: “I see him playing further forward rather than right-back, though I know he can play there. He has that athleticism you need to play full-back, wing-back as well but I think you can get goals out of him.“He’s versatile but I think sometimes with players you need to nail down a position so we’re trying to do that with Jesse.“But I definitely see him in the midfield area.”Curran is expected to continue in that right-wing role for the Dark Blues at Hibs on Saturday despite having fit-again Roarie Deacon as competition.The former Sutton United man missed the draw with St Mirren with a thigh strain but trained this week and is available.Sven-Goran Eriksson wants Dundee youngster Jesse Curran\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp sven-goran-eriksson-wants-dundee-youngster-jesse-curran embed # secretxcPQdfeTm\" data-secret\"xcPQdfeTm\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#Sven-Goran Eriksson wants Dundee youngster Jesse Curran# # Evening \" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bf3f4dff169b-e1542721422611.jpg ","title":"no parking bus at hibees for dundee","story":"Jim McIntyre has no plans to park the bus this coming weekend as his Dundee side travel to free-scoring Hibs in the Premiership.The Dark Blues have the leakiest defence in the ision while the Hibees have notched  in five league matches at Easter Road ahead of their clash on Saturday.The Dens gaffer is under no illusions how tough it will be against Neil Lennon’s side, though he’s seen encouragement from his side over the past couple of matches.And he’s planning to put their opponents “under pressure” as his side aim for a much-needed result.He said: “Things were taken on from the Motherwell game and things were more positive with the St Mirren performance and it’s about trying to turn small margins into points.“We know we are facing a top side in Hibs who have done a fantastic job this season, are an exciting team to watch and have a lot of attacking threat but we have to go there and put them under pressure.”Of late, however, the Hibees haven’t won in their last four – but that recent form won’t change how Dundee prepare.“You are going to have peaks and troughs through any season but I’m sure them being at home Lenny will have them fired up,” added Jim.“We know they have good players and will be looking to take maximum points but from our own end the encouraging signs have been there and we want to try to build on the St Mirren result.“The boys clearly know how I work now after a month.

Ness Bank and Cavell Gardens ndash on the opposite side of the river ndash is also included in the proposed mph zone.The zone includes a road near the park where motorist John Macdonald knocked down a four-year-old boy and drove off leaving the youngster seriously injured in July last year. Macdonald was later jailed for four months, banned from driving for a year and fined pound.Statistics show several other accidents took place between January  and July  in the planned mph zone.Regional MSP and long-time road safety campaigner David Stewart said winning public support is vital for the project.ldquoWith such issues, I am always of the mind that key stakeholders and those directly affected should always be fully consulted on such matters and consideration given to any concerns raised before a final plan is put forward for approval, he said.ldquoI have in the past been an advocate for wider footpaths to better accommodate cyclists and pedestrians and I have also suggested that the surfaces be painted a set colour to inform those utilising them of their primary use.He added: ldquoWith regards to the mph speed restriction proposed for the Bught Park area, this makes total sense to me since this area is well utilised for sporting and recreational purposes by many people and will make the surrounding roads safer for all.Sunday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118446.jpg","title":"Vital housing service is under review","story":"SCORES of vulnerable people in the Inverness area are set to lose a leline service.The housing support service provides practical help to people at risk of becoming homeless or struggling to manage their everyday affairs.But almost  long-term clients have received letters from Highland Council saying they will no longer receive it as it is only short-term.The move has alarmed charities such as New Start Highland and Gateway ndash previously the Highland Homeless Trust ndash which are contracted by the council to support clients with tasks such as managing money and helping to keep them safe.Following urgent representations, the council has agreed to review cases where there would be signicant hardship but concerns still remain that more people could become homeless or fall into debt.Frank Reid , of Dalneigh, suffers short-term memory loss and has relied on support from Gateway to maintain the tenancy of a bungalow since losing his we four years ago.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities. Alzheimer Scotland wants to make sure that people with dementia and their carers can work with local decision makers, helping to influence important decisions about how vital care and support is delivered in their area.We need your help to ensure people with dementia and carers get the best possible standard of care and support, anywhere in Scotland.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"bustling prestwick town praised national","story":"NewsBustling Prestwick town praised on national stageThe town landed second place in Scotland at the Great British High Street Awards last week.ShareByPippa Smith:,  NOV NewsSuccess Prestwick is boom town \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBustling business in Prestwick has been praised on the national stage.

One thing I am absolutely certain about is this: a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for Scotland and the whole of the UK.It would harm the economy, threaten jobs and damage peoplersquos standards of living. I will do everything I can to stop that happening.Irsquove been disappointed by the soap opera of cabinet resignations over the past few days and Irsquom dismayed that colleagues might yet try to force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.That would be a huge distraction at the worst possible moment.It is time for MPs on all sides to recognise that the alternative to the deal we have negotiated is leaving the EU without a deal. I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights. However, to support their own political objectives, they currently plan to vote against the proposed agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has shown resolve, determination and strength of character as we move towards the final, dficult stages of the Brexit process. She is doing whatrsquos right for our local area, Scotland and the whole of the UK ndash and Irsquom right behind her."},{"url":null,"title":"sparkle-in-style-this-black-friday-with-jewellery-deals","story":"Black Friday is fast approaching, making now the perfect time to think about treating yourself to a bit of bling*.

to campaign for a new high school in Hawick - ahead of both Galashiels and Selkirk.Westminster MP John Lamont and Holyrood MSP Rachael Hamilton have launched the campaign, which aims to bring about a new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came on the back of assessments of the four schools that found they all have what are described as major defects.The facilities at each school were graded from A to D, with A signying that the buildings are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick

cease trading this yearamid severe turmoil in the sector.The Press Association reported earlier on Friday thatthe company had enlisted KPMG to assess all options for the firm, including an administration.KPMG was initially brought in to oversee an accelerated sale or merger with another provider, but the collapse of rival Extra Energy this week and well-documented pressures in the industry caused alarm among would-be investors.A Spark spokesman said that the company is still working to merge the parent firm and its workforce with a larger provider.ldquoIf successful, it would mean Spark becomes a standalone part of this large independent supplier ndash operating from our offices in Selkirk, Edinburgh and Horsham offices, supplying our customers under the new parent

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

Irsquove no reason to touch anyone in that way.He said he had never been spoken to by park management about any complaints made against him and he was let go without any explanation.Following all the evidence, Sherf John Cook agreed to the defence motion to acquit Salinger on a charge of sexual assault on a woman which was alleged to have taken place at his previous employment at the Cakes  Shakes outlet in Musselburgh.The sherf also acquitted Salinger of a second alleged offence of making inappropriate comments and sexual gestures towards another woman at the same place.But the sherf told Salinger he was ldquosatisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had sexually touched the two teenagers at Seton Sands and said to think otherwise would be ldquofancul.Sherf Cook added that the offences had been ldquodeliberate sexual assaults and not accidental and that the pots and pans excuse was ldquoinherently unlikely.Sherf Cook deferred full sentence on Salinger for the preparation of social work reports and a restriction of liberty order assessment.The sherf also placed Salinger on the sex offendersrsquo register for a period still to be decided.Salinger was found guilty, following a summary trial, of sexually assaulting a teenager by seizing her by the bottom and squeezing it at Seton Sands Holiday Park on an occasion between March  and May .He was also found guilty of pressing his body against a second girl, placing his hands on her waist, and rubbing his groin against her at the same location and between the same dates."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-swan-and-the-rat","story":"IN THE early th century there was an incident recorded in a publication called Book of Sports and Mirror of Le by Pierce Egan. It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

I realised I didnrsquot know quite where to start. The feeling of inclusiveness, the uncontaminated landscapes, the astonishing beauty of cities like Edinburgh and the thriving cultural hub of Glasgow, all of these make a person who lands on Scottish soil feel welcomed into a special place.There are so many driving factors that bring people to Scotland and leave a permanent imprint in their minds. There is a good reason why the country was voted as top destination by travel publisher Rough Guides in  ndash it just has so much to offer. But how do the most popular tourist attractions shape up  I set out to find out.National Museum of ScotlandChambers St, Edinburgh EH JFFree www.nms.ac.ukIf someone were to think of a Scottish remake of A Night at The Museum with a sci-fi feel, then the National Museum would be the ideal setting. Besides a rich collection of curiosities from the Victorian age and archaeological relics, it has a scientic section with working models of engines and machines that would wake anybodyrsquos inner child.A solemn Victorian building on the outside, it hides a labyrinth within its walls, at whose heart is a bright and wide central hall connecting all the other sections and a laid-back cafe. Free tours run every day. What I found outstanding, besides the breadth and iety of the permanent exhibitions, ranging from scientic achievement to art and world cultures, is its interactivity and its aim to be a hub for culture and development: the cafes and other spaces where people can sit, relax and explore it bit by bit ndash or just use it as a meeting point. I loved its originality the rooftop, for instance, not only offers a spectacular view on the Old Town and the surroundings, but is also a small botanical garden with historical and geographical information. The section on New Scots is also a reflection of the countryrsquos propensity to embrace foreign cultures. I believe there could be more information provided in foreign languages, so that people whose English is not incredibly fluent could enjoy the exhibits even more. The collections stand up well in comparison to other museums in Europes capital cities.Vote:  Edinburgh CastleCastlehill, Edinburgh EH NGTickets on sitepound poundThe iconic building is like a gem encrusted on top of a hill, watching over the city from above. A very well preserved inner area hosts so many dferent museums and areas of interest it reminded me of a Russian doll ndash there is always something new to discover, a new corner with a dferent, stunning view on the Old Town. Yet its interior, which is rich in detail, is not over-designed, and renovations are good enough not to look, as often happens, like a bad copy of the original. However, despite creating one of the most stunning urban landscapes I have seen around Europe, I have to admit it was not love at first sight when I visited one of the UKrsquos highest rated locations. High season can lead to queuing for around  minutes, battered by rain and chilly wind, for a ticket that was not what I would call cheap. Whereas I understand such a building requires funds to keep running, it is one of the most expensive attractions I have been to. I also find that the absence of a student or young people discount is unfortunate, although discounts are available for children, families, senior citizens and the unemployed. Information around the castle grounds is basic unless the visitor decides to pay for an audio guide . These are well made and available in a very good iety of languages. Staff are present all around the castle and are ready to help visitors. Edinburgh Castle is a magnicent piece of history, however, they should work on their prices.Vote:  Scottish National GalleryThe Mound, Edinburgh EH ELFree With a Da Vinci masterpiece welcoming you as you step into the first exhibition hall, entering the Scottish National Gallery is like walking into a pantheon of myths. A fascinating journey spanning the centuries and crossing the borders of the Old Continent, itrsquos an adventure through artistic treasures, going from Botticelli to Van Gogh, going through the main exponents of Scottish art ndash a feature that, Kelvingrove Museum aside, makes of it a unique collection.Though modest in dimensioncompared to other art galleries across Europe, it is dense in quality and rich in ersity. Itrsquos setting in the old building on The Mound makes it a stupendous landmark on Edinburghrsquos skyline. The interior has a feeling of solemnity and cozy familiarity at the same time. Lights and artworks are very well positioned so that the visitor can enjoy the paintings and sculptures at their best. What I found particularly worth of praise is the amount of information given for each piece of the exhibition: whereas many other galleries would not go beyond basic details such as title, author, a few dates and the technique adopted, the National Gallery provides details and background for each masterpiece, making it easier to the occasional visitor to read through the beauty standing in front of them. It unclosed the gallery, making it more accessible and yet entertaining and educational.The staff itself was very warm and from an international background. On the downside, there was little information for those whose native language was not English, though maps were available in the most common European languages and Chinese. I found it a place where I felt welcomed, and where I would go more often to explore in more detail.Vote:  Riverside MuseumPointhouse Place, Glasgow G RSglasgowle.org.uk museums venues riverside-museumSet on the northern bank of the Clyde, the Riverside Museum stands out from the surroundings for its incredible architecture, a legacy from pioneering architect Zaha Hadid, which looks like a mixture between a urban skyline and an ECG segment. Despite being quite a niche genre of display, this transport museum is strong in its interactive approach and its reconstruction of the ages in which the vehicles were in use. This makes locomotives, trams and cars become something more than a mere model ndash they are part of a frame made of sounds, architectures and colours characterising their times, be it the s or the th century. I found staff particularly helpful and attentive, and two simple cafes offer an occasion to rest. What I think is extremely positive is that free tours are available during the day for groups, which is helpful to gain a deeper knowledge of the objects and on the history of the city as well. Part of the information displayed on screens, positioned in ious parts of the building, is available in the most common European languages and Mandarin, although many details appear only in English. It is good to see that there is information in languages which are now part of the Glasgow community, such as Urdu and Polish, to make it more accessible to families living in the area. Overall, this is a very immersive experience: from one of the first carriages of the Glasgow Subway to the Glenlee, the ship moored on the river outside the museum, itrsquos a true moveable feast back in time.Vote: . Kelvingrove Art Gallery and MuseumArgyle St, Glasgow G AGFreeglasgowle.org.uk museums kelvingroveKelvingrove Museumrsquos red walls stand out from the green background of trees of its namesake park, and make it appear even more magnicent and solemn, especially by night, when the lights make it a beautul and a bit sinister sight while it glows through the darkness.I found it a very good starting point to discover the history of this country, especially while going through the paintings and relics of the Scottish Identity in Art section and I appreciated immensely the collection dedicated to local design and Charles Rennie Mackintosh ndash a figure unknown to me before my visit. The free guided tours are very insightful without giving too much information, keeping the visit entertaining and making it easier to take in the concepts passed by the guide. One of the best features is the majestic organ towering over the centre hall: being caught by the resonance of a starting recital while contemplating the ious pieces of the collection or while sipping a coffee in the bar at the ground floor is an utterly pleasant surprise. Moreover, one of the most revered items, namely Christ of St John of the Cross by Salvador Daliacute, is finally back home after a long tour in London and Florida. Set in its own display section, the painting emanates a magnetic aura.Unfortunately, I didnrsquot find any information available in languages other than English, although foreign tourists might benefit from some specic indications. Despite this, Kelvingrove represents a beautul example of a hub dedicated to culture and science.Vote:  OUT OF TOWNLeaving behind the thriving main cities, Scotland is first and foremost known for its sublime outdoors, with landscapes so beautul to often seem unreal. A few of them however seem to attractLoch NessThe legend of the monster is just part of the magnetic attraction that Loch Ness seems to have on the global public. Tourists from all over the world gather ndash a human flow that could easily lead to the transformation of a pure and beautul place in something more similar to a fun park. That has happened, to an extent and tours, cruises and Nessie centres are abundant around Loch Ness shores. Despite this, and in line with an attitude that I particularly appreciate in Scotland, the wilderness and mystic allure of those places have not been altered. The more ldquoboring touristy bits can be avoided by renting a car or going a few steps away the most visited locations ndash the magic is still there.Loch LomondIt is dficult to find a place from which not to adore Loch Lomond, be it walking along its southern shores in Balloch, through the West Highland Way, or crossing the Trossachs National Park by train while heading to the Highlands from Glasgow. I believe people living in Glasgow are extremely lucky to have such an amazing view on their doorstep ndash something that made me fall in love with Scotland. You can drive up from the most industrial centre of the country and you can find yourself lost in nature, with little or no people around you. Its multiple locations make Loch Lomond one of those places to discover bit by bit, getting to know it better each time ndash although it can be tricky to get to places outside the main route without private transport.SkyeThis beautul corner of the world has been in the news due to the influx of tourists which has seen facilities fully booked and ndash at times ndash overwhelmed. On one hand, itrsquos good to see so many people appreciating the breathtaking landscapes of Sligachan, Portree, the Old Man of Storr and many others. On the other hand, the island is probably not equipped as yet to face massive incursions during summer. Something which, I believe, is not entirely a negative side. What Scotland has over other countries is also its ability to preserve its environment, with a respect I wish was present in my home country as well. Although there could be scope for improvement on facilities such as public transport and accommodation, I hope Skye wonrsquot lose its unspoiled beauty."},{"url":null,"title":"to-see-ourselves-as-new-scots-see-us-scotland-by-the-people-who-have-moved-here","story":"Nela Popovic, events manager.

I could have got work as a teacher in England but that wasnrsquot possible here.People ask questions like, lsquoHow did you come here  Did you come by aeroplane or by boat rsquo Even though we have British nationality, it seems sometimes that people think we are coming in to drain the welfare system.

It was just not what I had imagined. I come from a culture that is quite conservative. I have three children. They know they are Muslims, but they go to Catholic school. They participate in all the Christian events. I think thatrsquos your opportunity to meet other cultures.What I miss most is the food. Recently I made a curry for a girl who had moved from Singapore to study here because I know how it feels to have come here. I cooked her chicken curry for her birthday the way that they have it back home.Lourdes Gala Santos, from Tenere. Lives in Glasgow and works in wind turbine engineeringI moved to Scotland in  because I got a PhD position at the University of Strathclyde. I remember getting on a flight into Prestwick and taking a train into Glasgow and being very excited about my new le. On the train the ticket master was saying, lsquoTickets, tickets.rsquo And he asked, lsquoItrsquos your first time in Scotland rsquo I said, lsquoYeah, Irsquom just moving here. Irsquom so happy to be moving to the north of England.rsquoThe face of this man! He said, lsquoThis is Scotland. Scotland is a country.rsquo So within half an hour of landing I was educated into Scotland being a country. I said I was really sorry. I was so glad that he did not throw me off the train.The following day I kept seeing the St Andrews flag and I phoned my mum and I was saying, they must love Tenere here because our flag is absolutely everywhere. Then I realised that the Scotland flag is exactly the same as the Tenere flag. We share the same flag. It makes me feel at home.My PhD was in aerodynamics and control for wind turbines. So I started a career working in the renewables industry. For wind and tidal and marine renewables, therersquos not a better place to be than Scotland.One of the things that surprised me about people in Scotland is the amount of alcohol people drink with the intent of getting drunk. In Spain and Italy we also drink but not so much to get hammered.Scotland has the most amazing outdoors that Irsquove ever seen. I have travelled quite a bit and when you go to the Highlands or the coast itrsquos incredible. No picture can convey how overwhelming it is up there. I discovered cycling here in Glasgow to my surprise. I had rarely touched a bicycle before that..Praveen Kumar, grew up in India, worked in some of the worldrsquos best hotels and runs Tabla restaurant in PerthBefore I came to Scotland I was working for Sandals hotels in Jamaica and met a couple in the Caribbean. I had been going to go to work in the United States but it was them that enlightened me about Scotlandrsquos quality of le. I found a job at the Turnberry. I came in February  and it was a sunny day, but freezing, and I arrived in shorts and a T-shirt from Jamaica. That two minutes walking from my flight to the terminal was my first experience of actually being in the cold.Later, I got headhunted by Gleneagles. Not long after that my parents found a girl for me, in India, and in March  we got married. In  we opened our restaurant, Tabla, in Perth. Somebody recently asked me, lsquoWhy Perth  Yoursquove got so much talent and knowledge. Why not London rsquo The answer was itrsquos not money that motivates me, itrsquos quality of le. My we and I have built a community around us. The restaurant is embedded in the society in which we live.The most important thing Irsquove found here is the people and their friendliness. Theyrsquore approachable. You can approach anyone in Scotland. If you ask me Irsquom Scottish. Itrsquos been  years so I think I can call myself Scottish.I miss the buzz you get in India. Thatrsquos one thing thatrsquos missing here. In Indiayou want to do something, you can do it straight away. If I want to go and see my friends, I just go. I donrsquot need an appointment. I donrsquot need permission. I just go. And, of course, I miss the food, the street food. Thatrsquos what Irsquom building a business around bringing the rustic street food to all over the UK in a chain of restaurants.Tatsuya Minagawa, , from Yamagata, Japan. Owns renowned whisky venue The Highlander Inn in Craigellachie.I was working in a whisky bar in Japan and I thought Irsquod see more of the whisky environment, this is why I came to Scotland. It was meant to be just for one year. Itrsquos been more than  years now. Probably my biggest surprise was how friendly people were. It was strange for a big city like Edinburgh. Itrsquos not the same as in London or Tokyo. Then I moved to Speyside and was a bit worried because it was so remote...but it turned out to be really good.I was let down by the work attitude at first. It was so much dferent than in Japan. The efficiency of the staff, the attention to detailhellip I still think, to be honest, that itrsquos like that. Back home I had to ask only once for something to be done, but here sometimes you have to ask two or three times. But itrsquos a small issue and I love Scotland. I enjoy living here ndash this country welcomed me very well.Working in the whisky industry, I saw that the drinking culture is very dferent. Here, bars close very early, and people rush to get the last drinks, whereas in Japan they are open for longer hours, which means that people take more time to indulge. We do get drunk, too, donrsquot get me wrong, but in a much dferent way.I find that Scottish and Japanese, we are very dferent but also very similar: we donrsquot have big conversations when we meet the first time: it takes a long time to build a relationship, but when it happens, it lasts longer for forever.Vangelis Stamoulis, , came from Athens, Greece, in  to do postgraduate studies at University of Aberdeen. Sales manager in the oil and gas industry.I found the Scottish culture to be very similar to the Greek one: people are very open, sociable and direct and hospitality is great ndash I felt at home almost immediately. One of the surprises was how the weather was, particularly in Aberdeen, being so far in the north. It doesnrsquot change much ndash itrsquos either cold or very cold, you never actually get a summer.What I really like is that you can get in the car and in less than half an hour you are in the middle of an amazing countryside, andyou like hiking, photography, visiting castles or whisky distilleries thatrsquos perfect.I guess that was the most enjoyable aspect: although I live in a city it felt like living in a village. However, Aberdeen is an international city because of the oil and gas industry, you get to meet people from all over the world, and Scottish people are very tolerant with dferent cultures.I think that Brexit is going to affect all of us, both European and British citizens, and will do so in a very bad way. For me, it has been a beautul home. Irsquove built my professional career here, itrsquos a beautul and safe country, and I hope that I can continue leading my le here.Bola Ugoji, grew up in Nigeria.

My -year-old daughter and I came through Heathrow, met my husband and he brought us to Edinburgh. I remember when I walked around then, there were few blacks. But that has changed. Now we have a lot of black people around. Still, even then it was okay because a lot of the white people would come to you and ask you questions, smile at you.After I had my second daughter I felt it would be best for me to set up my own business. I saw a shop space on Great Junction Street and took over that place, selling African food. I was there for nearly five years. Sometimes when I walked down the road, everyone would be waving, lsquoMaDeb! MaDeb!rsquo A year ago I moved the shop to this site on Leith Walk.Here, when your mum is old, she has to go to a home. Where I come from, we donrsquot do that. If my mum is old, I, or my young ones, look after her. I found it shocking when I came here. There was an old lady neighbour living by herself. Sometimes I would go in to say hello, just to chat with her. She was happy seeing us.

The unions argue that pay has fallen in value over the last decade and they want a % rise as a ldquorestorative measure. Swinney says % is unaffordable and has offered %. A proposed rejig of the main grading scale would also boost incomes.Teachers remain hostile to the offer. A rally in Glasgow, held to promote the pay claim, attracted tens of thousands of supporters. In a consultative ballot last week, around % of members in the two main unions - the EIS and the SSTA - rejected the % offer. A statutory strike vote is getting closer.Swinney could ignore the unions and stick with the % offer, which was formally made by council representatives as part of the tripartite body set up to determine teacher pay. He could argue that no other public sector group is getting close to % and explain that such a rise would go to all teachers, regardless of income, including heads on pound, a year. He could stand his ground.The political reality is he will put more money on the table. Swinney and his Cabinet colleagues are trying to build momentum for a second independence referendum and want to assemble a coalition of voters to tip them over the edge. The SNP Governmentrsquos ultimate objective would not be advanced by tens of thousands of teachers going on strike.Swinney has already antagonised the unions by writing to teachers directly about the % claim. They saw it as an interference in their democratic affairs. It also backfired: after Swinneyrsquos ldquocommunication, teachers overwhelmingly rejected his pay offer. He will now want to dial down the row.What is he likely to do  With extra money coming to Scotland as a result of the UK Government budget, Swinney is in a position to argue for extra resources to bump up the offer. One suggestion is a deal over three years, rather than twelve months. Such an outcome would have the advantage of ensuring that teachers will not cause the Government any more headaches on pay until after the  Holyrood election.Police officers were recently given a multi-year deal and the First Minister last week hinted that a similar offer could be in the pipeline. ldquoPay awards need to be affordable, becausethey are not affordable, they cannot be delivered, she said. ldquoI would love to give teachers and all public sector workers a  per cent pay rise, but that is simply not affordable in a single year.One reason for believing that strike action could be averted is the positive relationship between Swinney and EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan. Whereas EIS members have an increasingly unfavourable opinion of the Education Secretary, the union leader gets on well with Swinney. Asked about him last year, Flanagan said: ldquoI think he is very competent.Back in the s, Flanagan was a Militant Labour councillor in Glasgow whose political career was stymied by the party. He is believed to have a long memory of his treatment by Labour and has constructive relations with the SNP Government. He is also said to be more critical of council umbrella group COSLA than Swinney.However, simply increasing the pay offer creates an additional problem for the Government. Councils employ a range of staff, not just teachers. The unions that represent these workers have made similar arguments about restorative pay claims and they too are limbering up for strike action. If EIS members get %, why should it be lower for those in the GMB, Unite and Unison COSLArsquos position on ldquoparity - which roughly means staff groups receiving the same inflation pay increase - is noteworthy in this respect. Swinney could solve one problem by offering a % rise to teachers, but in the process trigger strike action by the other unions which would want the same for their members. Sturgeon herself raised this point on Thursday by saying that ldquoall public sector workers have suffered because of years of pay restraint.Put another way, consider the range of staff that work in schools as part of the wider ldquoteaching family. If Swinney agreed to a % rise for teachers, heads on pound, would get a pound, boost. By contrast, the lower paid classroom assistants, cleaners and school technicians would get % in one year. It would be a tough sell for any Government that claims to believe in fairness.As Finance Secretary between  and , Swinney had a knack for producing creative solutions to a range of problems involving local government. He will need to be politically nimblehe is to solve the puzzle of the teacher pay dispute.CLASSROOM PAYTeachersPoint pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Headteachers and depute heads can earn between pound, and pound,THE sONE aspect of the current dispute that will be irritating the SNP Government is the repeated comparisons to the Thatcher era, when teachers walked out over pay.Between  and , the EIS led a sustained period of industrial action in protest over pay. John Pollock, the unionrsquos general secretary at the time, said thatthe ldquogrocerrsquos daughter was going to be made to listen, the EIS had to be prepared for a long battle.Action included work to rule and a series of national one day strikes, which included targeting the constituencies of Tory government ministers. Malcolm Rkind, the then Scottish Secretary, responded by announcing an ldquoindependent review into teachersrsquo pay and terms and conditions, after which an agreement was accepted.Over thirty years later, teachers are poised for another strike over pay and opposition politicians are calling for a root and branch review of remunerationWHERE DO THE PARTIES STAND Pay rises for teachers are a matter for the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers, not Holyrood, but opposition parties can apply pressure on the Government.The Scottish Greens have been most vocal in backing the unionsrsquo demands for a % rise and party co-convener Patrick Harvie has brought the issue to the chamber on more than one occasion. Raising the result on the consultative ballot last week, in which nearly % of teachers who took part rejected a % deal, he said:ldquoNone of us needs a maths teacher to help us to understand those numbers. Can the First Minister recall a more overwhelming democratic mandate from any section of the Scottish workforce Labour has also been supportive of the call for a restorative pay award. MSP Iain Gray, a former teacher, was highly critical of the Governmentrsquos decision to write to teachers directly over the % offer. He also compared the SNP Government to previous Tory administrations:ldquoThe last time Scotlandrsquos teachers were angry enough to go on strike Margaret Thatcher was still prime minister, I was a school teacher, the First Minister was a school pupil and some of the % of current teachers who have just rejected the pay offer were not even born.The Conservatives, who have backed pay restraint at a UK Government level, have not supported a % rise. The Liberal Democrats described the ballot result as an ldquoextraordinary and brutal rebuke to Swinney and have called for a ldquofair deal and an independent expert review."},{"url":null,"title":"rossetti-drawing-bought-in-second-hand-bookshop-for-75-to-go-on-show-at-museum","story":"The artwork, called Ricorditi Di Me, Che Son La Pia , has not been exhibited in public in  years.Rossetti featured the model Alexa Wilding, whom he first met in the street, in the  study for a painting he completed in .He used his better-known muse Jane Morris, we of arts and crafts designer William Morris, for the final painting, La Pia DersquoTolomei, which is now in the Spencer Museum of Art in Kansas.The drawing, bought by Sir Ivor Batchelor, is part of the Sir Ivor and Lady Batchelor Bequest, made to the Fitzwilliam in , with highlights of the collection to be displayed from December .Henrietta Ward, assistant keeper for paintings, drawings and prints, said: ldquoThe fact that he found it in the bookshop was quite a fluke.Sir Ivor wrote in an essay: ldquoIt was in the tiny second-hand bookshop of Robert Aitken in Bruntsfield, Edinburgh, in the years immediately after World War Two that I found drawings and prints which were within our miniscule budget and which were often of real quality.ldquoAitken was a dealer of exceptional knowledge and discrimination.ldquoIt was a red letter day in  when off the floor in Aitkenrsquos shop, with a windfall of royalties from a book, we bought for pound Rossettirsquos very fine and very large drawing for La Pia.Museum workers inspecting the piece found a typewritten note from Rossetti on the reverse, with his instructions for care.It read ldquoThis drawing not being lsquosetrsquo it will require the greatest careever removed from its frame, and was followed by Rossettirsquos address.ldquoItrsquos quite nice that he put that little warning note, said Ms Ward.She said Rossetti was ldquoquite famous for his use of models, he had very obsessive relationships with his models.He had an affair with Jane Morris and ldquoabsolutely loved her, Ms Ward said, and had been ldquoobsessed with Wildingrsquos ldquobright auburn hair and her beautul face.The exhibition, called Collecting And Giving: Highlights From The Sir Ivor And Lady Batchelor Bequest, features  objects from the overall collection of  items including drawings, bronzes, glass and pieces of English pottery.Also in the display is a .inbronze statue of Perseus by Sir Alfred Gilbert, who famously sculpted Eros in Piccadilly Circus.Perseus, who killed the snake-haired Medusa in Greek mythology, is portrayed as thoughtful by Gilbert, with one winged sandal off as he equips himself.Sir Ivor Batchelor, who was Professor of Psychiatry at Dundee University from  to , died in  aged .Lady Batchelor died in .The couple first made contact with the Fitzwilliam Museum in  and generously donated objects from their collection over the following decade.This will be the first time items from the Batchelor bequest are exhibited together, and they will be displayed at the Fitzwilliam Museum from December   to March  ."},{"url":null,"title":"pms-letter-to-nation-an-utter-work-of-fiction-says-labour-mp","story":"The -word message, released late on Saturday night, said that the result of the EU referendum in  would be honoured and that freedom of movement would end.It also stated that the UK would ldquotake back control of laws and money which, it suggested, could be spent on the NHS.The Prime Minister also said that she isldquodetermined to deliver a Brexit deal that works for every part of our country ndash England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Ian Murray, Labour MP for Edinburgh South said:ldquoThis letter is an utter work of fiction, and shows just how desperate the Prime Minister has become.ldquoThe people of Scotland and Britain wonrsquot buy this deal, no matter how hard she tries to sell it.ldquoItrsquos incredible that Theresa May is repeating lies about NHS spending, putting our economy at risk, and threatening the very future of the United Kingdom she once claimed was lsquopreciousrsquo to her.ldquoThere is simply no parliamentary majority for this deal, because it is the worst of both worlds.

Israel responded to the rockets with air strikes at more than  sites in Gaza. The violence was the worst in the region since the -day conflict in .In August  then Minister for External Affairs Humza Yousaf condemned rocket attacks from Gaza but added that Israelrsquos response was ldquodisproportionate.His assessment was based on the death toll in Gaza, where , people died, including , civilians. On the Israeli side,  soldiers and six civilians died.Michael Oren MKsaid: ldquoI understand the Scottish Government has taken a position on us which is probably the harshest of any political party in Europe. They vie with some of the Swedish parties and the Irish parties.ldquoBut let me say aboutdisproportionality. First of all, it is a gross misreading of international law. I studied international law. Disproportionality says very simply that an army can only use the force necessary to meet the threat. If we use a certain amount of force and rockets continue to fall on our territory then the force cannot be disproportionate, just cannot by definition.ldquoSo, itrsquos a gross misreading and I would say a gratuitous misreading of disproportionality principles. We are in fact,anything, under proportion in our use of force.ldquoMany other societies, most other societies, would use a reckless amount of force to stop rockets falling on civilians. We have not done that. We have the power, boy we have the power. We could end it very quickly.Human Rights organisation Amnesty issued a report on Israel earlier this year which accused the government of ldquocollectively punishing Gazarsquos entire population with an air, land and sea blockade.The blockade has triggered a humanitarian crisis with electricity cuts affecting clean water and sanitation and diminishing health service access. The blockade has rendered Gaza increasingly ldquounliveable, according to the United Nations.Oren said: ldquoI know this is dficult but when you think about Gaza you have to throw out everything you know about everything in human affairs. Irsquoll give you examples. Hamaswants to keep a low light on the humanitarian crisis there but it burnt down a crossing to Gaza three times. It burnt fuel lines to a population which is in any case only getting three hours a day of electricity.ldquoAnd by the way Hamas has   electricity in its tunnels and its bunkers and headquarters. No problems there with electricity, no problems with water.The Scottish Government said its position on the situation in Gaza ldquowas and continues to be in line with much mainstream international opinion.A spokesman for the Scottish Government added: ldquoMore generally, we support international efforts to bring resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on working towards a two-state solution."},{"url":null,"title":"top-israeli-politician-celtic-fans-who-fly-palestinian-flag-are-sad","story":"Michael Oren, deputy minister in the Israeli Prime Ministerrsquos office, also said collecting cash at matches for charities thathelp Palestinians is ldquoill-advised.But when asked what he thought about Rangers fans who fly the Israeli flag the politician smiled and said: ldquoI like lsquoem.The Herald revealed in September that the Palestinian and Israeli flags were on a police list of flags which could be a criminal offence to fly in Scotland.A ldquorestricted document issued to officers includes pictures of potentially criminal symbols and a brief description of the laws which may be brokenthey are flown ldquoin a provocative manner.The Israeli flag is flown by loyalists who ldquoalign themselves with Israel due to British support for the state, according to the document.

Perhaps theyrsquoll be watching tomorrow when InSight touches down on that distant world which has so long held sway over the imagination of humanity. Perhaps theyrsquoll realise that the landerrsquos mission is another vital rung placed in the ladder which will inevitably take us sooner rather than later from this blue planet to that red planet.Nasarsquos Insight lander is basically a robot geologist which will unlock the secrets of Mars - including why the planet has no electro-magnetic field to protect it from the sunrsquos deadly radiation. If Mars ever bore le then one theory has it that it was the loss of its magnetic shield which caused that le to end. Andmicroscopic le is still there, it will be hidden beneath the surface away from those killer rays.InSight left Earth in May and is set to make touch down around noon on Monday. The excitement in the space community around Insight is tangible - everyone you speak to can barely contain their anticipation, because InSight underscores that what was once thought impossible is now becoming probable: humankind will one day walk on the surface of our closest planetary neighbour, and most likely colonise it too.However, while that journey now looks very likely to take place in the near future - perhaps as early as the mid-s - the struggle to make it happen is Herculean. Lives will be lost, trillions spent, reputations made, and careers ruined. But when that manned mission happens, it will change humankind forever. Not only will we have become a space-faring species, and secured ourselves from extinction - with humans on two planets it is unlikely we will ever be wiped out by war, weather or any other wild event - but humanity will have created a collective and unying goal that will change how we co-operate across nations and see ourselves and neighbours. It would be the greatest moment of change in the history of humankind - and it will probably happen in our letime. On top of all that, we could also discover whether there was ever - or perhaps even still is - le on Mars, albeit microbial, and answer the most profound of all questions: lsquoAre we alone rsquoSome ask whether the pay-off is worth the risk. Most scientists tend to think like Jim Lovell, the astronaut who commanded Apollo  on its near fatal mission to the Moon in . lsquoIs it worth it rsquo Lovell asks himself in his mid-west drawl. lsquoUh-huh, itrsquos worth it.rsquoChapter OneFIRST STEPSRight now, in labs and research centres around the world the groundwork is being laid for the future mission. Biologists and chemists are working out how astronauts will take enough water and food to stay alive on a  million mile journey lasting around seven months. Psychologists are trying to establish how a handful of people will endure such a voyage in a gloried tin can and then live together without killing each other while pioneering the harshest environment humanity has ever experienced. Physicists and engineers are designing the sort of rockets and le support systems that will get us there - and hopefully back.Liz Seward, senior strategist at Airbus Defence and Space - which is building the new Mars rover for the European Space Agency at Stevenage in England - says the next decade will be spent learning how humans can live in space. The moon will be used as a testing ground and sometime after  people could be exploring the red planet. lsquoTherersquos water ice there so humans would be able to live there and mine it,rsquo Seward says.Seward thinks that the future of space exploration depends on private companies working with national governments. lsquoGoing into space is quite expensive,rsquo she says, adding: lsquoEventually someone has to pay for it and there has to be a reason to be out there. There are resources you can find on Mars and the Moon and on asteroids that you canrsquot find on Earth.rsquoChapter TwoGETTING THEREElon Musk - one of the richest people in the world and a man who could have stepped from the pages of a sci-fi novel himself - has as his chief project the building of cities on Mars. His company SpaceX has supercharged the new space race.Muskrsquos engineers are designing the Big Falcon Rocket- a fully reusable spacecraft. His team is evangelical - weeping when rockets crash land and ecstatic when a flight goes well.But humanity is still a long way from the goal. lsquoAll we can do right now,rsquo says Jim Green, Nasarsquos planetary science ision director, lsquois land a one tonne rover, to get humans there we need a  tonne spaceship.rsquoThe key is next-generation retro-rockets. The Martian atmosphere is so thin that there is little to slow a spacecraft coming in at Mach . Any ship will need to turn its thrusters to the surface of the planet and fire them up to cause enough drag to land safely. Bladed shields will be indispensable to stop the craft evaporating in the heat of its descent, and even old-fashioned parachutes will be required to add a little extra gravitational pull.Chapter ThreeTHE COLONYSo what do we do once we get there  Most probably the first humans to arrive on Mars will live in their ship - but that couldnrsquot last long due to the effects of solar radiation. Eventually, wersquod have to build some permanent site. This Martian outpost wonrsquot be a series of domes in the arid landscape. Wersquore more likely to set up home in the empty lava tubes of extinct volcanoes - where there might be a chance to find frozen water and where wersquod definitely be much safer from solar rays.A Martian colony would comprise a number of key buildings: therersquod be lsquohabsrsquo for living in a communications and satellite post a medical centre a cargo centre an oxygen creation centre called a lsquoMoxiersquo a water creation centre called a lsquoWarsquo a solar  field a D printer post a nuclear reactor and a mining centre. It would be austere but efficient.Chapter FourTHE FIGHT FOR SURVIVALBut would it be survivable  Astronaut, Scott Kelly, spent a year on the International Space Station, while his twin brother Mark, a former Space Shuttle commander, stayed on Earth, in order to test the long term effects of space travel on the human body. Muscles atrophy, bones weaken, the cardio-vascular system slows, red blood cell production drops, balance deteriorates, eyesight fails, the immune system is hampered. Thatrsquos just the really bad stuff - therersquos also a constant blocked up nose, insomnia, and the dreaded space farts because interplanetary travel means extra gas in the body, not a lot of fun when yoursquore trapped in a command module.So much for the physical effects - what about the mind  Two main projects have tested psychological resilience to space travel: the Hi Seas Mission at Mauna Loa on Hawaii and the Mars  Mission in Russia. In both cases, small crews were kept isolated in a simulated spacecraft for months on end. As all Mars scientists know, the human being must be as resilient as the rocket.From the Mars  experiment, only two crew remained psychologically heathy out of six. Four experienced problems with mood, impulsivity and insomnia. Most were trained astronauts and medics. We still donrsquot know why there were effected, or how to prevent such effects reoccurring.Chapter FiveTHE SWEET SPOTSo once we make the gruelling journey where would we land  Dr Philip Thomas, principal investigator with ExoMars, the joint European-Russian mission hunting for le on the red planet, says until the ExoMars satellite swung over our distant neighbour in  we knew lsquodiddly-squatrsquo. Wersquod only mapped about three percent of Mars. lsquoMoving dunes, dust devils, polar caps, are all now being seen,rsquo he says.Once we have a D map of the planet wersquoll be able to pick the safest, flattest site. Mars is known as the graveyard after all. Nasa historian Roger Launius of the Smithsonian Institute explains that only % of probes sent to Mars are successful in their mission. lsquoThatrsquos not a great track record,rsquo he says.Launias thinks our initial forays to Mars will be a little like our journeys to Antartica. Initially wersquoll explore, then wersquoll build a research station at a sweet spot that is resupplied with people and material from the outside world, and slowly wersquoll build up a presence in an inhospitable land. McMurdo Station in Antartica is now an effective city with many nations working together there.Chapter SixDAILY LIFE ON THE RED PLANETHowever, as the popular scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson makes clear: lsquoIf you want to stay there, you need to grow your own food.rsquo At first, wersquoll do this is small greenhouses, then giant greenhouses, but in the long-term the plan would be to terraform Mars - to turn the red planet green. Broadly speaking, that means creating a huge greenhouse gas effect to heat the planet and thicken the atmosphere, but as yet we donrsquot have the technology, so when we do get there it looks like wersquoll be living in habs at the bottom of volcanoes and eating greenhouse GM food for a while.Just because we get there, though, it doesnrsquot mean wersquoll survive. The docu-drama Mars, on the National Geographic channel, paints a terrying portrait of le for early settlers - all informed by scientists like deGrasse Tyson. Mars is unforgiving. It kills. Rockets mal, fires break out, minds snap - and a trail of human bodies is left littering the path to humanityrsquos new frontier.Perhaps the greatest risk to human le once we get there is weather. Nasarsquos Jim Green says: lsquoWersquove been studying dust storms for quite some time and therersquos a particular season where some of the dust storms can go global. They can be enormous -  kilometres high. They can get charged and in the case of these really large storms lightning can strike.rsquo These storms can last a month. It sounds impossible to survive.Chapter SevenWHERE THERErsquoS A WILLhellipRichard Nixon was the president who pulled back from the drive to go to Mars, following public concern in the wake of Jim Lovellrsquos Apollo  expedition, and focussed instead on Space Shuttle missions. Many in the space community call the shuttle project lsquogoing into low orbitrsquo as it didnrsquot really take humankind anywhere. It was like giving up on the New World after Columbus sailed to America.With that in mind, loss of le - which many see as inevitable - could derail any Martian exploration. Roger Launius, from the Smithsonian, says: lsquoIf you send astronauts to Mars and they die there, I guarantee you that public opinion will prohibit you from ever doing it again.rsquo Itrsquos little wonder that the moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, are named after the gods of fear and terror.The thing is, though, humanity has already dreamt of going to Mars. From the ancients through to modern science fiction writers, we have the idea of journeying to, and living on, Mars engrained in our collective consciousness. If yoursquove dreamt something, yoursquoll most likely one day do it.Peter Diamandis, co-founder of Planetary Resources - an asteroid mining company - says: lsquoTherersquos a romanticism about going to Mars and colonising it - and itrsquos a future in which we are building cities. We humans love a target. We love to have something to shoot for, to aim for hellip itrsquos been the case over and over again, whether itrsquos the colonisation of the New World, the railroads, the opening up of the west, all these things are impossible until we make them real.rsquoTHE SCOTS SCIENTIST HELPING PIONEER MARSDR PATRICK Harkness is a modestly-spoken man. Most of us wouldnrsquot be quite as humble about our endeavours as he is - after all, the Glasgow University scientist has developed a key piece of kit without which human exploration of Mars just wouldnrsquot be feasible.On Mars, low gravity makes it almost impossible to drill - the lack of weight means itrsquos extremely hard to get the necessary heft behind drilling machinery to crack the surface. But Harknessrsquos ultrasonic drill removes that problem - and think how important drilling will be on the red planet. As we know, itrsquos more likely we will live underground. Wersquoll also be searching for water beneath the surface, and microbial signs of le - whether long-dead or still alive and kicking - will probably be underground away from killer solar rays.For Harkness, though, there are big ethical questions over what we do with samples found on Mars. The plan for a Mars lsquosample and rsquo mission is already well underway. Its first stage would see a robot mission bring back rocks and possibly even evidence of extinct or extant microbial le. The work done in Glasgow has advanced the science around lsquosample and rsquo, but Harkness worries about the possible risk of Martian rocks contaminating Earth.lsquoWhen you take samples from another planet and bring them to Earth, you have to be absolutely certain they pose no threat,rsquo he says, lsquoand as unlikely as it may appear that there will be any virus or protein in these Martian samples, chances can not be taken.rsquoHarkness speculates the safest plan might be to take the samples no further than the International Space Station and analyse them there. Perhaps, they could be rendered inert on the ISS and then transferred to Earth.Hersquos conscious of the fact that with private companies now potentially leapfrogging governments in the space race that business needs to be regulated in the same way as agencies like Nasa for safetyrsquos sake. lsquoYou need regulation to stop crazy people putting the planet at risk,rsquo Harkness says from his office in the School of Engineering. lsquoTherersquos nothing wrong with doing things privately as long as they are regulated. If people just went to Mars and brought back samples that would be dangerous.rsquoAnother ethical worry for Harkness is the inevitable result of colonisation: babies. lsquoSay someone got pregnant on Mars - then you have a child who didnrsquot chose to be born on another planet. They will grow up experiencing one third of the gravity of Earth so their muscle tone will not be the same, their heart will not be strong enough to pump blood to their brainthey ever ed to Earth.rsquoDespite his caution, hersquos pretty confident that there will be men and women walking on Mars within his letime - and hersquos only . Such a monumental achievement, he said, could well uny our increasingly fractured planet and make Earth a better place for all."},{"url":null,"title":"mexicos-incoming-government-denies-deal-to-host-us-asylum-seekers","story":"The deal was seen as a way to dissuade thousands of Central American migrants from seeking asylum in the US, a process that can take years.In effect, Mexican border towns are already acting as waiting rooms for migrants hoping to start new lives in the US due to bottlenecks at the border.ldquoThere is no agreement of any sort between the incoming Mexican government and the US government, Mexicorsquos future interior minister Olga Sanchez said in a statement.Hours earlier, The Washington Post quoted her as saying the incoming administration of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had agreed to allow migrants to stay in Mexico as a ldquoshort-term solution while the US considered their applications for asylum.

Well, thanks to a new campaign by the Scottish Government, we don’t have to imagine the outcome.For that dream will become a reality on November , with people across the country being asked to commit to doing something nice for someone  on St Andrew’s Day.The Maake Someone’s Day initiative aims to celebrate our generous nature.On Saturday, December , we’re also being invited to take part in the first Fair Saturday here, a celebraion of art and culture while raising funds and awareness for charities.A helping hand...making someones day need not cost a penny. Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:images.johnstonpress jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Missing teenager Liam Smith\"  Liam Smith: Search widens viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being. But living to the fullest is mostly about love. “In the last hours of our lives we won’t remember the things we owned but rather the people we loved.“Black Friday is one of the most irrational days of the year strong proof of a growing materialist system, based on the short term and unsustainable. “We do not pretend to fight against Black Friday but we do offer a positive alternative.“It’s all about culture before materialism. Social empathy before greed. “It’s a day to be better following a day to have more.”As for the future, Jordi hopes to target one of the world’s largest commercial markets – America.He added: “We are already taking the first steps to develop the movement in the USA in  and we’re expecting more European cities to get involved too.“Black Friday may be popular but surely Fair Saturday makes more sense.”To support Fair Saturday and find out about events in your area, visit the website at https:app.fairsaturday.org.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Sunday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Sunday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amAdvertorial: The Farm of Green, Eday Approximately  acres £, freehold The farm and lands of Green are situated at the south-east of Eday, just two minutes’ drive from the pier.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Sunday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The daughter of a self-made man, Coates gained a first in econometrics and went on to build her business up from scratch as a result of an instinct for the future and sheer hard graft. As that business grew, she based it in Stoke – bringing good jobs to a languishing post-industrial city – and set up a foundation which has donated £m to charities like Oxfam and CAFOD. On top of throwing energy into growing her company, she has five children, four of whom are adopted from the same family.There is a lot to commend there in , her entrepreneurship was recognised when she was awarded a CBE for her services to the community and business and the following year she was named one of the UK’s most powerful women by BBC Radio ’s Woman’s Hour.And yet for all Coates’ undoubted attributes, there is no getting away from the central fact: her online betting company, Bet, which last year had an operating profit of £m, has flourished on the back of the UK’s two million problem gamblers and the obscene salary she pays herself – which is , times the national average – is money that would have been better staying in the pockets of those iniduals who can ill afford to lose on the horses .Much attention has been paid to the evils of Fixed Odds Betting Terminalswhich have been spreading like smallpox in the UK’s most deprived areas where people stake what little money they haveon the vain hope of beating the system.FOBTs – described as the “crack cocaine of gambling” – are so pernicious because bets of up to £ can be placed every  seconds often the terminals are juxtaposed with pawnshops encouraging those who have already lost too much to trade their possessions for one more go.After a succession of suicides were linked to FOBTs, the government promised to reduce the maximum stake to £. Of course, reducing the maximum stake reduces profits, which in turn reduces income to the Treasury. It took the resignation of sports minister Tracey Crouch to force the government to back down on plans to delay the move until October . Thanks to Crouch, it will now take place in April as originally promised.This is a step forward but the understandable focus on FOBTs means the burgeoning issue of online gambling has been less publicised. Which brings us back to Coates. Coates is no stranger to high stakes. She began her career in her family’s bookmakers business. In , she realised the future of gambling was online and borrowed £m from RBS with the family firm as collateral. Her risk paid off as Bet has grown into one of the world’s largest online gambling companies, taking £.bn in wagers last year alone.But there are many things about Betthat don’t sit easy. There’s its name for a start. Bet is encouraging consistent, daily betting – not the odd flutter on the World Cup or the Grand National.Then there’s the whole tax avoidance thing. Like most online gambling companies Bet moved its headquarters to Gibraltar because of its more “favourable regulations” .But mostly, the unease with Coates’ success comes from knowing it is built onan upsurge in online gambling amongst smart phone-using millennials who can place a bet at the tap of a screen. Unlike casinos and indeed FOBTs, online gambling sites can be accessed day or night, sober or drunk, and using a credit card. The service Coates’ company offers is not merely  days a year, but also  .A recent report from the Gambling Commission showed  to -year-olds are the group most likely to have more than five online gaming accounts and to have gambled in the past four months.Online, stakes on casino games like blackjack and roulette have been known to be as high as £,. In sports, there is now a panoply of hypotheticals you can take a punt on. Where once the options were fairly limited – the final result, the highest goal scorer – there is much more focus on in-play betting: the first penalty, the first red card or even, in one famous case, whether or not a particular player will eat a pie on camera. Sure, some of this is harmless – a way of adding a bit of extra excitement to the event but it’s not the harmless gambling that brings the likes of Bet the millions it’s the problem gambling. Coates’ financial success also underlines the way in which gambling and football have become totally enmeshed. North and south of the border, betting companies such as William Hill and Ladbrokes sponsor leagues and cups and strips, largely replacing tobacco and alcohol brands.In Coates’ case, the connection is even closer Bet has . per cent of the shares in Stoke City FC Coates’ father Peter is the chairman and her husband Robert is a director.Online gambling is widespread among players who tend to have a lot of down time sitting around hotel rooms with nothing to do but play on their phones there is peer pressure too. It gives the players something to bond over, the irony being, of course, thatthey are caught gambling on football matches they face a fine or suspension.I suppose you could argue that making money out of gambling is no worse than making it out of smoking or drinking all three involve fostering potential addictions. But in Coates’ case, it’s the sheer scale of the inidual profiteering that shocks. The £m she is pocketing this year alone is more than double the total wage bill for Stoke City.That sum would be offensive enough in any sphere butshe were making her money from manufacturing a product or providing a service or creating something of social value, then at least there would be a quid pro quo.As it is, it is dirty, predatory money, and she’s made no attempt to cleanse it the addiction charity Addaction claims the sum she paid herself is over  times more than the entire industry’s contribution to treatment, and her foundation has made no contribution to that cause.To say Coates has worked hard for what she has earned is not enough to say she is not breaching any laws is a cop-out.The growth of Bet depends on persuading more and more people to squander money they cannot afford on a game that, in the long-run, they will always lose.

It’s not because he couldn’t bring certain things to the campaign, I think it’s people hears saying things but also backing them up with actions.” Many Scots women who voted No in  were remain voters in  and the ensuing turmoil has hardened attitudes, the WFI work indicates.“Brexit has been a huge game-changer” Ms Young added.  The “trust and credibility” which Westminster once enjoyed has withered.“Her style of Government and the types of policies that she’s promoting are making a huge dference to the number of women that we hear from, they’re amongst the reasons why they’re supporting independence,” said Young.She added that after Brexit, a lack of respect for Westminster politics is seen as a “huge reason” for the sht towards Yes.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4834693.1543131384!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish independence campaigners aim to thrive on brexit turmoil","story":"Independence campaigners are mobilising as they seek to #seize the opportunity# presented by the Brexit turmoil engulfing UK politics, leading figures among pro-nationalist groups have said.They say Nicola Sturgeon will “absolutely get a mandate” to stage a second referendumshe puts it to the people at the next Holyrood election, as Westminster continues to withold authority.But the First Minister has been warned she must adopt a radical approach to persuade Scots that a Yes vote will avert the looming “clf edge” of Brexit and transform the country’s fortunes.It has prompted claims from pro-Union groups that nationalists will “never stop” campaigning for independence despite no sht in the polls towards a majority for independence.Sturgeon has come under fresh pressure to set out her timetable for a second referendum after publication of the final EU Withdrawal Deal was met with derision and appears likely to be rejected in the Commons. “Across the board in the Yes movement there is a real appetite to seize this moment of opportunity,” said Green MSP Ross Greer, who was also communities co-ordinator with the official Yes Scotland group during the last campaign.“A UK state that is in complete crisis, that is bogged down in its own contradictions, is causing this damage to Scotland and the UK as a whole in such a visible public way.”He said “huge numbers”ofpeople were getting involved in such things as marches outwith the formal party political campaigns.“The opportunity we have to really give the independence vision a shot in the arm is to give a vision of how things can be better – or how do we mitigate the damage of this bad decision, but present a vision for society that says this doesn’t have to be Scotland’s long-term future.”The Scottish Independence Convention, an umbrella body of  pro-independence groups recently announced plans to take on two full-time employees as part of a drive get support for a Yes vote above  per cent. It came after a fundraising drive secured more than £,. Vice-convener Dave Thompson, who also heads up Christians for Independence, said: “We need to be prepared. That’s why we’re setting up the company and employing staff and getting ourselves organised. We need to be ready for whenever that campaign happens. At the moment, it’s very dficult to know when that’s going to be.“We’re ready any time. We could go very quickly, butit’s a bit further down the line. we’re ready for that as well.”Margaret Young, national co-ordinator with Women for Independence, said local groups had been forming in recent months even without any particular promotional activity.“Throughout  we’ve had about one new group a month forming,” she added.The roadblock facing the SNP at Holyrood as it seeks to hold another vote is the fact that Westminster has control over the constitution and Theresa May has refused to grant the “section ” order which would pave the way for a second vote. The First Minister has ruled out a Catalonia-style vote without legal backing and indicated last week that she may put the referendum to the people by making it the centrepiece of the Holyrood election in . If a pro-independence majority was ed, such as the current SNP-Greens alliance at Holyrood, it would be seen as an irrefutable mandate.Greer added: “In those circumstances I think you absolutely can get a mandate to win another referendum and in that situation any continued opposition from the UK government would just be completely unsustainable.”The last independence campaign initiallyfloundered, Greer said, when it sought to allay voters fears’ of leaving the UK with the message change would “safe” and minimal.“The public know independence is a massively radical step,” he added.“We need to justy why that radical step is necessary and will result in better things. We need a compelling message from the start.”But pro-Union campaigners insist there is no appetite for independence among most Scots as the post-Brexit chaos ensues.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: “This is a stark reminder that nationalist groups will never stop campaigning for a isive and unnecessary second independence referendum.“We know from polls that the majority of people in Scotland want to remain in the UK.“But there must be absolutely no complacency.

However, with around  of his Conservative colleagues publicly opposing it, the deal is unlikely to pass.“From my point of view, all we’re trying to do here is deliver Brexit in a way that doesn’t do damage to the Union and doesn’t do damage to our own economy, and I think EEA Efta is the best possible way of doing that,” Boles told Scotland on Sunday.“I think it’s potentially a very good plan for the Scottish people, and all parties that represent them,” he added. Under Norway plus, which EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has previously said is on offer from Brussels, the UK would remain in the European Economic Areavia membership of the European Free Trade Association , which includes single market members Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.Efta members are not members of the EU customs union, but the UK would strike a customs deal separately with Brussels to keep the free flow of goods.Because the whole of the UK would remain within the single market, as well as EU customs rules there would be no need for the Irish border backstop, and no risk of a trade barrier in the Irish Sea or competitive advantage for Northern Ireland compared with Scotland.And because accession to Efta is expected to take much less time than negotiating a new security and trade agreement between the UK and EU, there would be no risk of needing to extend the -month post-Brexit transition phase.“This would be a much cleaner, simpler, unquestionably unionist proposal,” said Boles.His original proposal was dubbed “Norway for now”, and suggested the UK use Efta as a stepping stone towards a more loose Canada-style free trade deal with the EU. However, members of the four-nation bloc rejected temporary membership.A Norway plus model would be opposed by Brexiteers andbreach most of the red lines set by May’s government, but would match the objectives set out by Sturgeon and Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer.“I’ve had conversations with some of [Ms Sturgeon’s] MPs down here and I’m very open to have further such conversations,” said Boles. “I’d be delighted to discuss with anyone in the SNP. “I’ve had discussions with Plaid Cymru MPs, with Labour MPs, with DUP MPs, and crucially with Scottish Conservatives, many of whom were not totally comfortable with the temporary idea in my original formulation.“For many of them, going into the EEA before the end of the transition, before December  is very attractive. You’d obviously get control of fisheries immediately.”Several Scottish Tories are understood to be supportive of an Efta fall-back, but one, Gordon MP Colin Clark, said he still wanted a Canada-style trade deal. “Norway would see us continuing to pay around £bn a year in contributions to the EU, and that’s not where we want to be,” he said.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates - in the current year, many of which will provide vital additional income to local bars, restaurants, shops and attractions.\"Gordon Fraser, deputy chairman of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said: \"It is, of course, right and proper that local politicians get involved in such important issues, but for Councillor Bruce to insist that we should simply swallow the enormous increases in rates, salaries and energy costs at Aviemore without seeking a reasonable increase in the amount we receive for allowing Highland High Le members to use private leisure facilities, is blatant double-standards.\"Itrsquos a bit rich for the council to increase our annual rates bill by . per cent in the year to March  and yet when we seek a modest uplt in charges to help us cover a small element of those and many other cost increases, one of the councilrsquos own officials described our request as lsquounaffordablersquo.\"Like us, many local businesses might consider their large rates increases to be lsquounaffordablersquo but we have no choice other than to pay them.\"Councillor Bruce should remember that we entered into this agreement, and were happy to do so, on the basis that it saved Highland Council from having to spend many millions on building their own swimming pool and leisure facilities locally.\"And he should also bear in mind that the annual sums we are discussing are far, far lower than those which Highland Council would face each year for running their own facilities.\"Despite the ill-judged intervention of Councillor Bruce, we have been encouraged by the constructive and helpful approach of other politicians and hope to meet with senior council officials in the very near future to resolve what has been a damaging and unnecessary episode.\"The sooner we can welcome High Le members back into Aviemore, the better, but it has to be on a sustainable and viable commercial basis.\"Councillor Bruce was unavailable for comment.He had asked: \"Given that HIE awarded an pound. million funding package to Macdonald Hotels to develop the Avie-more Resort ndash including the construction of the leisure arena in the early s ndash should Macdonald Hotels not allow High Le card members to use the swimming-poolfacility in view of the public funds they enjoyed and has this point been raised in negotiations rsquoHighland Council has said it remains open to restarting negotiations.Aviemore Primary School pupils recently wrote to Mr Macdonald asking for the pool to reopen and the schools parent council led by Judith Thurlow has also been part of the campaign.Sunday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118344.jpg","title":"Its far from being the end of the line","story":"Tom Ramage\"IM nervous as heck!\" confessed Karen Blessington, as she prepared to launch her own railway line last Friday.\"I have never spoken in public in my whole le so please bear with me...\"The huge crowd certainly did that and they loved every minute of the occasion as the flag went up again at Grantown East exactly  years to the day it last went down.It had been quite a journey \"from sadness to joy\" as she put it, following those drastic Beeching cuts of the s.\"The Phoenix has risen from the ashes of a derelict brown site.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost. I came into the classroom so happy and delighted to share the news with the class,” she said.Alanah spoke of the importance of young teachers making their mark in the city especially with so many who are choosing to go across the water or travel further afield.“Loads of my friends have left and gone to Liverpool, places like Qatar. I’m very much a home bird, I love being here, teaching here but I ask myself the question what does going across to Liverpool to teach have that we don’t have here at home  How are we supposed to make young lives betterwe leave and take our skills where “There is a young teaching staff in the Religion department here and our big focus is very much on ethics, making the subject more relevant to the pupils’ lives, how do you live out your faith through action  The girls I teach are so kind, there is a real kindness about our pupils, they would offer you the food from their lunch boxes, they are just so, so caring. At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly. I can see them from my window and it just makes me smile knowing they are going up and more importantly want to go up, you don’t have to police them,” she said.Alanah spoke warmly of the “community spirit” in St Louise’s and how “everybody knows everybody” as school le presents “always something new”.“This is a huge school but you know everyone in it. It’s like a wee family. There isn’t a day I don’t laugh in this school,” she said."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"football tops at coca cola plant causing division says local man","story":"A COCA-COLA worker has described working conditions at the multinational’s Lambeg plant as “intimidating and antagonising” for Catholic employees as breaches of the company’s policy on work clothing are on the rise.The man said that though the wearing of football tops is expressly banned, Rangers and Northern Ireland jerseys are routinely worn by members of staff with no action being taken. And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said. No-one is even being talked to never mind disciplined for their actions.“Personally, I feel antagonised, intimidated and fearful working in a place that is allowing this to continue and I know others do too. This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy. This follows the guidance of the NI Equality Commission which states that the wearing of football shirts has the potential to disrupt a good and harmonious working environment.“In line with the Commission’s guidance, we do not prohibit the wearing of a poppy at work.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renowned west belfast artist to set out stall at culturlann","story":"PROLIFIC West Belfast painter and illustrator Tony Bell is set to unveil a personal retrospective exhibition entitled ‘Special People Special Places’ at the Cultúrlann on Thursday November .

These pressures have left many of our members on the verge of quitting their jobs. This is an intolerable situation for the NASUWT, we are committed to defending the rights of our members in this school and hope that a constructive engagement can begin soon with the employers to fully address the situation.”A spokesperson for the CCMS, which oversees St Patrick#s said: “CCMS fully appreciates the right of teachers to take industrial action. However, we do not believe that in this instance such action is either proportionate or warranted. It is our firm belief that the issues at the heart of this dispute can best be dealt with through an open and honest dialogue which seeks to provide balance to the concerns of both sides.“CCMS echoes the Board of Governors in its call for a suspension to the proposed industrial action in order to create the time and space for meaningful and respectful dialogue aimed at resolving the issues of concern and dispute.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37561535.ece/53705/AUTOCROP/w620/DUPconference002.jpg","title":"dup deputy leader tells pm it is not too late to bin brexit deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

boy travelled america treatment rare spinal condition","story":"A Ballinderry mum says she intends to raise more awareness of an advanced treatment for a rare spinal condition in that hope that it will be made available to children in the North.Donna Ferris’ three year-old son Charlie was diagnosed with progressive infantile idiopathic scoliosis when he was just six months old.If left untreated, the spinal deformity can lead to severe twisting of the spine, respiratory problems and even decreased le expectancy.When little Charlie was first diagnosed back in February , doctors in Belfast told his anxious parents Donna and Jodie that their only option was to put their son in a plaster jacket to hold in the curve in his spine until he was old enough for surgery.However, determined Donna vowed to do everything in her power to keep her baby son away from the operating table and invasive surgery.After hours of online research, the mum-of-four found a hospital in the United States which offers specialised scoliosis treatment.Donna discovered that Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia offered advanced treatment which could potentially avoid surgery.She said: “When I was researching I checked for hospitals in the east coast of America as I knew it would be easier to fly into there from Ireland.  I came across Shriners Hospital and made contact straight away askingthey accepted international patients.  They said they did and sent me some forms which I filled in.  Within four days of applying to the hospital for the treatment Charlie was accepted, and within a month he was at the hospital.”On April , , Donna, Jodie and their four kids made the trip to Philadelphia for Charlie’s first appointment.Just a few days later, Charlie was fitted with a Mehta cast which was specially designed to correct the curve in his spine.Over the last  months, Charlie has made the same journey  times.Before having his first cast fitted, the curvature in Charlie’s spine was at a -degree angle.Earlier this month, during their th trip to Shriners Hospital, the Ferris family received the news they had been hoping for.“They took Charlie’s brace off  hours after arriving at the hospital and sent him for x-rays.  After this the doctors brought us in and gave us the great news that Charlie’s spine is now down to six degrees,” said Donna.“I just burst into tears crying.  I just couldn’t believe it.  The staff at the hospital were also crying and hugging us.  They were just so, so happy.  They are always willing the children on there.  It was just amazing news to get.”Donna said before starting his treatment in the US, Charlie was a ‘very restless baby’ and she ‘really struggled to get food into him’.Now, she says her son is a completely dferent person.“The boy we have now is just perfect.  He is meeting all his milestones and is doing everything a wee child of his age should be doing and he will go on to lead a healthy le,” she said.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Charlie knows that he’s dferent and he has to wear a brace that not everyone  does but he’s adapted to it all from the get-go, he’s just brilliant.“The plan now is that Charlie will remain in brace until June next year and then he will switch to a night time brace for six months at least.  Hopefully he will not have to wear a brace at all eventually.”Following Charlie’s diagnosis and the news that he would have to travel to America for the specialised treatment, the Ballinderry and wider community set about fundraising for the family to help fund their travel, something which the Ferris family are ever grateful for.Donna also has nothing but praise for Shriners Hospital.“Words cannot describe how grateful we are to the hospital for what they have done for us,” she said.“When we first took him to the hospital we knew Charlie was going to be in expert hands as they specialise in infantile scoliosis.“We are so, so grateful to them and it’s very hard to put into words how good they all are.  They don’t just treat Charlie, they treat the whole family.  It’s the same people treating Charlie each and every time and he has become so familiar with them all.“Shriners is a non-profit hospital and they treat families regardless of their ability to pay.  All the time we have been there we have never received a bill from them.  To go half way across the world to another hospital and not be billed is just amazing.”Charlie’s journey over the last  months has been well documented by Donna on a Facebook page named ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’.Through the page, other parents in similar situations have reached out to Donna who has offered them support and advice.  She has also given them ‘hope of what can be achieved’.On November , Donna attended the Families First awards ceremony in Sligo Park Hotel where she was presented with an ‘Inspirational Person’ award – an accolade which she had been nominated for by a parent from Co Cavan.“I spoke to the audience and told them our story and I received a standing ovation afterwards.  I was just overwhelmed by how many people I have touched out there.  It was the perfect end to the perfect week.”Donna now hopes that by speaking out about Charlie’s treatment that it will give other children hope.“The treatment that Charlie received at Shriners Hospital has been available at Great Ormond Street Hospital since July this year however I really want it to become available across the UK and Ireland.“Charlie is living proof of what can be achieved by this gentle, non-invasive treatment so why not offer it to babies here and give them a chance.“I want to be able to help other children in our own country and want parents not to have to feel the need to travel abroad for adequate care.  I would just love to see this treatment available here so there is hope for other families.”To follow Charlie’s progress visit ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’ on

Based on their interview transcripts, the film dramatizes the police interviews which took place at the time.Detainment stars Will O’Connell , David Ryan , Tara Breathnach , Morgan C. Jones , Brian Fortune , Kathy Monahan , and introduces two exceptional young actors, Ely Solan and Leon Hughes.Speaking to the Derry News, Vincent Lamb said that he hopes the film will challenge public perception of the boys who committed the murder and open a wider debate on the matter.When asked what drew him to the story, he replied: “I was asked that same question when I was over in London where I did an interview for Sky News the UK audience find it strange that an Irish filmmaker would be interested in something so deeply rooted in the British consciousness.“But it affected the people here in Ireland just as much as the people in the UK. I was  at the time it happened and I remember it very well.“I remember growing up hearing about it and heard it mentioned again as an adult and it was unexpected how I felt about it at the time.“I started reading everything I could find on it and then I got the transcripts [of the police interviews] and felt that I was seeing something not everyone  was seeing.”SensitiveVincent said that casting the child actors for the roles of Thompson and Venables was challenging but that the young actors, Ely Solanand Leon Hughes , who have been critically-acclaimed for their astonishing performances, were ‘phenomenal’.“I had a lot of apprehension about making a film on such a sensitive story,” he said.“The public outrage at the time was unprecedented and it hasn’t gone away, it’s still there. So many people just seen these boys as being evil and couldn’t cope with the fact that they were just two little boys. The only way they could make sense of it was to see them as evil.“Newspapers labelled them as ‘evil monsters’, the spawn of Satan’ and ‘freaks of nature. People hadn’t really looked at other points of view andyou did, you were criticised – people couldn’t see any other reason for it other than they were evil.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“When I was , I accepted that they must have been evil but as an adult when I researched it a bit more, my opinion altered and I hope that this film will help other people change their minds.“By looking into the boys’ family background, I got a better understanding of what could have led two -year-old boys to commit such a horrible crime.“This film is not sympathetic to the boys and is not trying to make an excuse for them in any way but it humanises them. People may be more comfortable thinking of them as evil monsters but, after reading the transcripts, it was a tragedy for three families and that’s not a popular opinion.“The film is entirely factual, there is no embellishment – it is almost entirely verbatim. When I was making the film, given my apprehensions, it was very important to me that everything was factual.”‘Prevent this happening again’Vincent said that he was especially nervous when he heard that journalist and expert of the James Bulger murder, David James Smith, was attending one a screening of the film at the Winchester Film Festival. Smith wrote a book on the matter, The Sleep of Reason: The James Bulger Case.“He turned up at the last screening in the UK and I was terried,” he said.“He’s such an expert on the case, I was dreading to hear what he thought but he said the film was ‘authentic’ and a ‘remarkable achievement’ which was an amazing endorsement.“He also wrote a lovely review saying thatthe audience were willing to find the truth out about those boys, they could not ignore their inescapable smallness.”“People don’t talk about this case enough, butyou have any other opinion other than the boys were monsters, it’s rejected and it stles debate on the issue. We want to prevent this happening again so we need to understand the case.“I remember the Judge’s comments about the boys and I thought it was a ludicrous decision to name them but the more I read, the more I understood his reasons – he wanted a discussion about it, to look into the background of the boys and see how something like could be prevented from ever happening again. I hope that people will debate the case again after watching the film.”Vincent finally had a word for the Bulger family: “I don’t want anyone to think that I don’t have sympathy for the Bulger family, I have enormous sympathy for little James, for what he went through and what his family have been through.”‘Detainment’ by award-winning director, writer and producer, Vincent Lambe and Irish producer, Darren Mahon, will screen at Foyle Film Festival in the Nerve Centre on Sunday, November , at pm.More information about the film and upcoming screenings can be found at: www.detainmentfilm"},{"url":null,"title":"people derry urged think twice visiting emergency department winter emerges ae altnagelvin dealing 230 people","story":"UP to  people are visiting the Accident and Emergency department in Altnagelvin Hospital every day, it has emerged.The figure emerged at Novembers meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Community meeting, where senior figures from the Western Trust were in attendance to discuss its Winter Resilience Plan  .Speaking at the meeting Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Hospitals with the Trust, said that ‘demands’ were already very high on its services as it had experienced an increase in the numbers of people attending the AE department at Altnagelvin over the past year.She told the meeting that the eight per cent increase over the past year meant that the hospital was now dealing with  to  people on a daily basis, compared to a figure of  to  every day last year.Mrs McKay added that the bulk of people attending the department were Category  and Category  patients, who she said were the ‘sickest patients with the most complex needs’, adding that these patients would be in need of ‘immediate attention’, and required treatment within an hour.The meeting was told that the emergency department was facing additional pressures due to issues with gaining accesses to beds within the unit, adding that there also had been an increase in the numbers of people who have had to wait over  hours for treatment.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMrs McKay continued that it would be issuing an appeal through the media urging people to consider their condition before attending the local Accident and Emergency department.“We do believe there will be a tough winter ahead of us all, and we hope you can disseminate that information to people that they may not need to attend the Emergency Department,” she told the meeting.Mrs McKay also spoke of the extreme pressure placed on the department last winter due to the outbreak of the norovirus, and also urged people to take advice from their GPs on their condition before attending the AE.However, she also stressed thatpeople do feel that they must attend the unit, then they should not ‘take any chances’.“Go to your GP and take the advice,” Mrs McKay said.“If you need to the be there , then you need to there, because there are people who put off going there over the fear that there may be already large numbers there.”"},{"url":null,"title":"angela receives highest uk air ambulance honour","story":"WAA Chief Executive Angela Hughes receives her Letime Achievement Award.\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Angela receives highest UK Air Ambulance HonourWAArsquos fleet of four helicopters.\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"visiting tangent clubs luminary on hand to switch on llandrindod wells christmas lights","story":"Prize winners in the decorated lantern competitionreceive their prizes as Sue ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtHill presents Sophialtspan classtruncate-full-screengt Morgan with her first place award.

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award. I sincerely hope that it shines a light on how vital nature is to us all, our mental health, our wellbeing and the survival of all le.ldquoWe need more young voices to speak up and take action for nature though.

The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out.

The council also hopes to acquire match funding from central government.Among the key issues identied by council officials is either restricting or banning altogether unsorted black bin bag waste. Thousands of people regularly empty a iety waste into the bin bags and take them to the recycling centres. But that could be about to change.Council officials also want to vigorously challenge the perception that the centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.They say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling centres.The review examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive.There is also growing concern at senior management level that a signicant amount of the waste being taken to recycling centres ends up in the general waste stream as it cannot be recycled. Council officials say addressing this issue will cut costs and produce savings.Last night, politicians were asked for permission to complete a detailed report on the way forward, based on the evidence gathered during the review process, with a particular focus on centre opening hours and staffing levels that must be achieved at no extra cost.Councillors were told the report will also make a recommendation to harmonise policies and procedures across all current recycling centres in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Over recent months, local politicians have expressed concern at a number of fly-tipping and illegal dumping incidents across the district, with several taking place within a stonersquos throw of the Cloonagh Road facility in Downpatrick.This particular facility has long since passed its sell-by-date with work on a poundm replacement at the nearby Flying Horse Road currently underway.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

to avoid a hard Irish border which would see Northern Ireland continue to follow some EU rules around tradeno better solution can be found.Mrs Foster is expected to say: “We cannot wish away the fact that the draft withdrawal agreement contains arrangements that are not in Northern Ireland’s long-term economic or strategic interests.“Northern Ireland would remain part of the European Union’s customs code and as things stand we would be sowing the seeds of inevitable economic ergence from our largest market.”Tory Brexiteer Boris Johnson is also expected to address the DUP conference on Saturday.Mrs Foster acknowledged the frustration of many in Northern Ireland’s business community with the pace of negotiations.Her party has prided itself on its relationship with firms, but relations have been strained by their support for the draft UK-EU deal.Mrs Foster has said the DUP may revisit its deal to support the Conservatives in key votes at Westminster.She will tell her annual conference: “I acknowledge the hard work and determined efforts of the Prime Minister to secure an agreement.“She is genuine when she says she wants to see an outcome that does no harm to the Union and the internal market of the United Kingdom.“However, this draft agreement fails her own key commitments.“The Prime Minister has not been able to guarantee an outcome that eliminates the risk

tip of the Iberian peninsula travelled to take part in the DUP conference.The DUP leader is expected to pledge: “We stand with the people and the government of Gibraltar at this time.”Nigel Dodds, the

Government’s commitments under it are clear... including on Brexit. Commitments freely entered into must be delivered andthey are not, then clearly, as we have shown, there are consequences.“But it is in the interests of the country and of Northern Ireland that our parties continue to work together in the national interest.“Our agreement is of course with the Conservative Party.“It is incumbent therefore on all Conservatives in Parliament who recognise the importance of continuing stability and who wish to see the Government deliver its agenda to ensure it is honoured in full.”try catch     .               ..

A request by this newspaper three weeks ago revealed a list of over  decisions. However, a list obtained by the Belfastcontains  decisions.Stormont Castle stressed that it was not a complete list because “it is not possible to specy the terms in which any request for a decision may be put to ministers”. However, the Executive Office said that it expected the list it released to contain many of the proposals which will be put to them “at an early stage”there is either a restoration of devolution or a move to direct rule.The decisions cover every Stormont department with the exception of the Department of Finance, which did not include a response.The decisions which have built up include:• Whether to close or merge schools which are judged unviableSam McBride: DUP’s electoral insulation could be a  comfort Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"• A series of major planning applications of Northern Ireland-wide importance• An action plan to root out paramilitarism• Dozens of public appointments• Plans for superfast broadband• Use of recycled manure solids on farms• Funding for safety improvements at football stadiums• Welfare reform mitigation schemes• Radical reforms in health and education.There is some evidence, however, that Ms Bradley’s legislation to give civil servants some powers of ministers is having an effect. The list initially included the inability to raise pay for health workers. However, this week civil servants agreed to a policy which will see that happen.Calling for direct rule ministers, UUP leader Robin Swann said the revelation showed that “government is grinding to a halt”. He added: “Karen Bradley MP wouldn’t stand for it in her own constituency, so I don’t see why the people of Northern Ireland should have to stand for it either”.try catch     .               ..

OK, he and his we have jetted off to Lanzarote to get a break from work, the weather and, of course, the furore over Brexit. Sandra ChapmanHe wouldn’t normally decide to take a break at this time of year. But, as a Brexiteer, he says he has had his fill of politicians, politics and the  promises over Brexit. He says he will be back, but threatens to emigratethe country falls apart.He got a lot of sympathy from Himself who also has flown off this week to the British mainland leaving me with just the dog, which I’m pretty sure is happy to get a bit of peace and quiet from the pair of us who really haven’t been able to argue in any logical fashion about the political crisis surrounding us. Dogs are wonderful at pretending they understand everything you say especiallyyou are saying it near the cupboard where the treats reside.The whole sorry saga of Brexit is impossible to escape.I was about to roll up a page of newspaper to light the fire only to be drawn to the headline at the top: ‘The EU will turn us into captiveswe sign up to this appalling sell-out.’ It was the latest rant in the Dailyfrom Boris Johnson, who wants the Northern Ireland backstop scrapped with both sidesto simply ‘commit to avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland by the use of new unobtrusive checks and discussions of the future economic partnership’ where, he says ‘the Irish discussion rightly belongs’.suitcases packed.That was the day before Sinn Fein’s president Mary Lou McDonald was shouting at the top of her voice about the DUP being out of step on Brexit and ‘must face reality’. Now, I wonder what that reality might be  Seconds later she was urging Arlene Foster to “wake up and smell the coffee”. This is the very same Mary Lou who claims to have “no regrets” over her handling of the Mairia Cahill case. Mary Lou can shout all she wants. Only her own side will be listening.The Northern Ireland born Labour MP for Vauxhall Kate Hoey had a lot to say this week too. Ms Hoey informs us she has “ploughed through” the  pages of the proposed withdrawal agreement plus the explanation notes – that makes her a hero in my eyes – and declares that “Northern Ireland, to all intents and purposes, becomes separated in many ways from the rest of the United Kingdom”, with the backstop arrangements looking like they were written by the Irish government.All in all it means that the Republic of Ireland would, effectively, be representing Northern Ireland in the EU, she believes. A highly respected politician, one not given to exaggeration, I would say she has got it right. That was one page of newspaper I saved from the flames.Then, of course, there are the Scots whose nationalism is getting a fresh kick from the Brexit chaos.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, accuses Theresa May of asking people to “take a blindfold leap off a clf” with her Brexit deal. Ms Sturgeon, as we all know, has her heart set on independence for Scotland. She may yet be successful second time around. How amazing it is that women are playing such a big role in the whole Brexit saga.Years ago Margaret Thatcher had the political field all to herself. Had she been in charge today she would long ago have hand-bagged Jean-Claude Junker and the elegant Mr Barnier into submission. Theresa May, on the other hand, looks like the one being hand-bagged.Legacy Scandal: The IRA was able to wage terrorism on Castlederg because it was near the safe haven of the Irish Republic Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"So when does this crisis begin to calm down so that the rest of us can get on with planning our Christmas  It’s not looking good.

Four weeks later the cash for ash scandal erupted and rapidly led to her removal as first minister.At last year’s party conference, though weakened by an appalling Assembly election result in the wake of the scandal, Mrs Foster was able to use the DUP’s stunning position after the subsequent Westminster election to project an image of her party wielding unparalleled power and influence.The de facto deputy prime minister and the government’s chief whip were present to make speeches, a feat which would have been unthinkable for much of the history of a party which was steeped in anti-establishment ideology.Over the last year, the party has been dogged by crises and embarrassing revelations.In February, the party leadership came to the verge of a deal with Sinn Fein to restore Stormont but couldn’t sell it. That was followed by Ian Paisley’s suspension from Parliament for accepting lavish holidays from a foreign government.And for months the RHI Inquiry has exposed the myth of the DUP as a happy family, exposing feuding, nepotism, alleged drunkenness, incompetence, greed and backbiting.For the second year in a row, Arlene Foster has refused to speak to News Letter readers, declining to do the traditional sit-down interview ahead of the party conference.No reason was given for that decision but there has been internal DUP concern about Mrs Foster’s tone in interviews and her ability to face dficult questions.This year there are still the trappings of the DUP’s powerful position, with Tory big beasts in attendance at the conference.But there is the increasing concern among some unionists that the DUP’s influence with the government is not as substantial as the party boasted.For more than a year the DUP has been explicit that it was prepared to accept almost any form of Brexit so long as it involved Northern Ireland being treated the same as the rest of the UK – what Mrs Foster described as her “blood red line”.And yet the party has been unable to convince the prime minister of sticking to the one red line it outlined, with Theresa May’s Brexit deal setting out the prospect of Northern Ireland erging from the rest of the UK and staying closer to the EU in key areas of regulation.Foster: EU withdrawal text not in NI’s long-term interests Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The party now faces myriad dilemmas with decisions over coming months about whether to bring down the government and risk Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister, whether to replace Arlene Foster as leader, how to respond to the looming RHI Inquiry report and the question of whether it can sell a compromise with Sinn Fein in order to restore Stormont.Many unionists are reassured to see the DUP in the position where it finds itself, recalling how other avowedly unionist prime ministers have been prepared to disregard their views.For those people, the DUP is now a constitutional handbrake. Eventhat handbrake fails over Brexit, it will not necessarily result in electoral punishment for the DUP because in those circumstances those voters are likely to see Northern Ireland’s place as being all the more precarious and therefore see an increased need for a strong unionist voice.But while the DUP may be electorally insulated, the real damage could be to the Union itself, with the combination of Brexit, the exposure of DUP behaviour in government and Northern Ireland’s farcical governance vacuum leading to soft nationalists and some of the constitutionally unaligned becoming increasingly vocal in stating that they are now looking to Dublin for a solution.try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This will enable those who canrsquot make the Valersquos Daytime meeting to be informed and wersquoll offer help and explanationsneeded.ldquoItrsquos vitally important everyone makes their comments loud and clear in writing to the Vale Council at this time.ldquoWe need to drive home that a by-pass option is accepted through to the next stage of the process.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Plans have now been submitted to construct the homes close to Sprucefield, outside Lisburn. It would also involve a new link road on the M motorway. An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years. Elsewhere, this week a major £m housing development in Larne was awarded outline planning permission. Nuport Developments has been given the early go-ahead for  houses on the -acre site at Ballyboley in the town. The Ballyclare-based developer is now expected to progress to a more detailed plan for the housing scheme.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/may_1.jpg","title":"the brexit draft agreement business reaction","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew The publication of a draft agreement between the Prime Minister and Brussels over the UK’s exit has caused a huge stir among the political institutions. Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
