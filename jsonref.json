I sit there and I want to not just pray for my daugher but pray for Mr. Kelly to get some kind of healing,\u0027 Timothy Savage, Joycelyn\u0027s father, said. Joycelyn\u0027s mother, Jonjelyn, said watching his interview with King made her fear for her daughter\u0027s safety. \u0027I can only imagine what he does behind closed doors when there\u0027s no cameras.           Clary called anyone who believed they were being held hostage \u0027stupid\u0027 and \u0027ignorant\u0027           Joycelyn comforted Azriel in their interview.

Joycelyn, right, was 19 when she was flown to attend one of his shows with her mother\u0027He has, allegedly, a bad temper. He\u0027s very controlling.

I want to know that she\u0027s OK,\u0027 she said.  King asked him: \u0027What kind of love is it that keeps these young women away from their families?\u0027           Joycelyn\u0027s parents held a press conference on Wednesday morning to say R.

I just look at you\u0027re you and I am me. \u0027Now I don\u0027t know if you\u0027re married, I don\u0027t know one might be older than the other, one might be younger than the other. I just look at legal, OK. \u0027There are older men who like younger women and older women who like younger men.     Kelly lost his composure elsewhere during the interview and stood up in a fit of emotion, towering over Gayle King          Kelly stamped his feet and screamed while King remained composed in her seat   The singer needed to be restrained by his publicist at one point while King sat calmly in her chair          Once back in his chair, Kelly continued to rant into the camera but was redirected by King who told him: \u0027We have to have a conversation. I do not want you ranting into the camera, Robert\u0027 \u0027I am an older man who loves all women,\u0027 he said, adding that he knew men who had \u0027five or six women\u0027. He said he \u0027absolutely\u0027 had not had sex with Azriel when she was 17 or any other minor. Kelly\u0027s stance is that all of his accusers and their parents are lying. \u0027They\u0027re lying on me... You can start a rumor about a guy like me or a celebrity just like that.\u0027All you have to do is press a button on your phone and say, so and so did this to me. R Kelly did this to me.\u0027If you get any traction from that, if you are able to write a book from that, if you can get a reality show then any girl that I had a relationship with in the past that it just didn\u0027t work out, she can come and say the same exact thing.\u0027I\u0027m talking about the power of social media,\u0027 he said. He believes that they are financially motivated and that their stories have been fed by social media. He also thinks prosecutors are eager to put him behind bars after failing to convict him on child pornography charges in 2008.                              \u0027I don\u0027t look at much younger than me, I just look at legal.

I just look at legal                        \u0027How stupid would it be for R. Kelly, with all I\u0027ve been through in my way, way past, to hold somebody, let alone 4, 5, 6, 50, you said – how stupid would I be to do that?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s stupid! Use your common sense. \u0027Forget the blogs, forget how you feel about me.\u0027Hate me if you want to, love me if you want. But just use your common sense.\u0027How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I\u0027ve been through – oh right now I just think I need to be a monster and hold girls against their will, chain them up in my basement, and don\u0027t let them eat, don\u0027t let them out, unless they need some shoes down the street from their uncle!\u0027 he said. He said he is no longer fighting for his career (but still wants people to buy his music) and is now desperate to salvage his relationship with his children. In an unhinged monologue to the camera where he stood up, screamed and had to be restrained, he said: \u0027Quit playing, I didn’t do this stuff. ‘This is not me. I’m fighting for my f*****g life! Y\u0027all killing me with this s**t! I\u0027ve given you 30 years of my f****g career! 30 years of my career! Y\u0027all trying to kill me!

Y\u0027all don\u0027t want to believe it.\u0027 King, who has been applauded for his composed demeanor and tough line of questioning during his outburst and throughout the interview, remained seated, encouraging him to calm down.            King told Kelly at points during the interview that he was playing the victim and that he was hard to believe          The 52-year-old wept into his hands, said he had been \u0027assassinated\u0027 and insisted he was telling the truth After a brief pause, he continued back in his chair: \u0027This is not true! It doesn\u0027t even make sense! Why would I hold all these women! Their mothers and fathers told me, We\u0027re going to destroy your career.\u0027There\u0027s real girls out there missing, there\u0027s real young girls out there being abducted, being raped, OK. They really are on chains. They really do have chains on their wrists.           Prosecutors say Kelly’s alleged victims include a teenager he met when she sought an autograph during his 2008 trial on child pornography charges, another he met at her 16th-birthday party and his hairdresser, who was then 24. Kelly\u0027s Feb. 22 mug shot is seen above\u0027And they can\u0027t get out and they ending up buried,\u0027 he said. King, redirecting him, said she was not going to allow him to \u0027rant into the camera.\u0027 \u0027I came here for them to hear me talk!\u0027 he protested, adding: \u0027I need help. \u0027I need somebody to help me not have such a big heart. Because my heart is so big people betray me and I keep forgiving em,\u0027 he cried.King, without missing a beat, told him he sounded like he was \u0027playing the victim.\u0027 He cried into his hands in response and said: \u0027I\u0027m just telling the truth! And the reason I\u0027m emotional is because this is the first time I was able to say something. I have said nothing!\u0027 Kelly also said that he had been \u0027assassinated\u0027 and \u0027buried alive\u0027, adding proudly: \u0027But I\u0027m still alive.\u0027 Despite claiming that he has done nothing illegal or wrong, he admitted that if his daughter alleged against another man what he is accused of doing himself he would be so enraged he would not be able to control himself. \u0027I would have to arrest myself after I did what I had to do,\u0027 he said.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Dinosaur tracks make fresh impression Valley Forge park","story":" The trace fossils are scattered along a winding trail at Valley Forge National Historical Park, on slabs purchased in 2011 from a nearby commercial quarryThose marks drew the attention of Tom Stack not long after he began working as a volunteer park ambassador at Valley Forge in 2017.Tom Stack, who has a background in geology and paleontology, recognized the approximately 210 million-year-old rocks known as argillite as being similar in age and type to fossil-bearing rocks used to construct a 1930s-era bridge on the Gettysburg battlefield, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) to the west.  Tom Stack, who has a background in geology and paleontology, recognized the approximately 210 million-year-old rocks known as argilliteMost of the tracks left in what were once muddy flats consist of three-toed foot impressions from the early days of dinosaurs, although Stack also found footprints from a non-dinosaur reptile, a relative of the modern crocodile. The largest would have been a bipedal theropod that was 6 (1.8 meters) to 9 feet (2.7 meters) long and 4 (1.2 meters) to 6 feet (1.8 meters) high.\u0027They\u0027re subtle, they\u0027re not easy to spot, but once you learn the characteristics of them, given the right sunlight angle and, at times, the moisture on the rock, then they are easier to identify,\u0027 Stack said.There are also distinctive patterns in the rock thought to be caused by the cracking of dried mud, and from the ripples of a lake or river.The National Park Service requested the exact location of the rocks not be publicized, to help protect them from being damaged or removed. Officials said visitors will be told about the rocks and how park resources are protected, but not where to find them. The 5-square-mile (13 square kilometer) park has about 30 miles (48 kilometers) of trail.   Most of the tracks left in what were once muddy flats consist of three-toed foot impressions from the early days of dinosaursThe dinosaur footprints Stack found are not unique or even particularly rare, and don\u0027t add to the body of scientific knowledge about the creatures, said National Park Service paleontology program coordinator Vince Santucci. They date from later in the Triassic period and before the Jurassic era that\u0027s so familiar to moviegoers.\u0027There\u0027s no question that they are\u0027 dinosaur trace fossils, said Santucci, who examined them in person last April. \u0027They\u0027re consistent with the tracks that occur in equivalent-age beds all over the East Coast.\u0027More than 270 National Park Service properties contain some sort of paleontological resource, from Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado and Utah to the fossils scattered in rock used to build the Lincoln Memorial and Capitol Reflecting Pool in Washington, D.C.Fears monster Australian crocodiles could be SWIMMING to...Share this articleStack also found footprints from a non-dinosaur reptile, a relative of the modern crocodile Most fossils found on Park Service land are still where they were discovered, in the original bedrock location. But others were moved by human activity, including a set of burrows from an ancient species that appear on the rock facade of a visitor\u0027s center bathroom at Valley Forge. Those rocks originated outside the park.There also happens to be a significant Ice Age fossil location beneath the Valley Forge park, the Port Kennedy bone cave. First discovered in 1871, it has produced fossils that include giant tapirs, ground sloths and saber-toothed cats. Pork Kennedy is considered one of the most important mammal fossil sites in North America, with some findings having been displayed at the park visitor center, although most are at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. That 750,000-year-old site was lost after a quarry was filled - partly with asbestos - before being rediscovered by scientists in 2005. It is not accessible to the public.There are at least 35 Park Service properties known to have fossil tracks of ancient vertebrates, and vandalism and theft have been a problem. Federal law prohibits visitors from disturbing park elements.  The largest would have been a bipedal theropod that was 6 (1.8 meters) to 9 feet (2.7 meters) long and 4 (1.2 meters) to 6 feet (1.8 meters) high A park spokesman said there have been preliminary discussions about developing an interpretive program to give visitors information about the trace fossils. Stack said the park should consider removing rocks that contain the best fossils, to prevent damage or theft.\u0027I would think they are of value as an educational tool,\u0027 said Helen Delano, a senior scientist with the Pennsylvania Geologic Survey. \u0027Dinosaurs are a wonderful way to hook people into paying attention to the geological environment. Every kid loves dinosaurs.\u0027Stack said the rocks are abundant, cheap and durable, so they have long been used for paving, sidewalks, garden walls and similar features in the Philadelphia area."},{"url":null,"title":"Sunset Mulholland Inside Hollywoods retirement home list stars look own","story":"    The Motion Picture and Television Fund (MPTF) runs a retirement community in suburban Los Angeles for industry professionals the home is the focus of new documentary Sunset Over Mulholland Drive, which premieres this week at the SXSW film festival in Austin, Texas          Actress Connie Sawyer, who features in the documentary, passed away at the age of 105 before the film\u0027s international debut she continued acting and auditioning almost until her death and appeared alongside everyone from Susan Hayward to Liev Schreiber during her decades-long career          Director Jerry Sedley Kaufmann talks with fellow resident and actress Dena Dietrich they collaborated on a film created and produced on the MPTF campus          Residents of the home include producer Joel Rogosin and his wife, Deborah, a psychotherapist the community is open to the spouses of professionals even if they were not involved in the entertainment business‘There’s a deep connection between the running business and the retirement home – that’s what I realized,’ says director Uli Gaulke, who spent the last four years working on a new documentary about the community titled Sunset Over Mulholland Drive – which will have its world premiere next week at the SXSW film festival in Austin, Texas.He tells DailyMail.com: ‘In Hollywood, it’s very present, this project. The Motion Picture and Television Fund is supported by a lot of people from Hollywood … it’s a good idea, because I think the success of the A-list stars, if they realize that the success of the minority is based on the work of a lot of people around. And they give something back.’He adds: ‘That is a good way to send respect for the people who are not in the focus.’The campus, open to residents age 70 and over, offers impressive facilities the grounds include acres of walking paths, rose gardens, a community greenhouse, a putting green, dining options, a café, lounges and game rooms. In addition to options for independent living such as the cottages and bungalows, there’s a long-term care facility with 40 beds and a specialized Alzheimer’s and Dementia unit called Harry’s haven – named in memory of Kirk Douglas’ father, Harry Deminsky.Perhaps most importantly, however, the home features multiple creative outlets. There’s a 247 closed-circuit channel that showcases the original work of residents. There’s a studio, a writing group, and reading and video libraries. ‘Creativity is ageless,’ the MPTF community’s website boasts.And that’s exactly what filmmaker Gaulke – clearly enamored with the place and its residents – witnessed firsthand.‘The atmosphere at the retirement home, there was this kind of energy, this kind of creativity – and every one of the residents was interested in doing something, and they had all the facilities to do this,’ he tells DailyMail.com. ‘What impressed me was that their whole life, they were struggling. They had to earn money and they had to work hard, and now they were free to do what they want.’Gaulke’s film showcases a broad array of MPTF residents, all of them brimming with personality. Among them is actress Sawyer, who sadly passed away at the age of 105 before the film’s international debut.Growing up in Oakland, California, she dreamed of being an actress, but her father made her go to business school. She lasted three weeks in an office job before she quit and started acting on stage and screen, forging a lifelong career performing. She lights up as she watches herself on screen as a young woman, acting alongside Susan Hayward, Dean Martin and other luminaries.‘Do you know what she’d eat for lunch?’ she says of Hayward in the documentary. ‘A tomato and a hard-boiled egg. No wonder she had such a little waist.’Sawyer continued auditioning almost up until her death in recent years, she appeared in everything from Ray Donovan and New Girl to How I Met Your Mother and The Office.Other actor residents featured include Faulkner and King – but many members of the MPTF retirement community built their careers behind the screen.Producer Daniel Selznick, for example, may not be instantly recognizable, but he comes from what is akin to Hollywood royalty – and has been responsible for blockbuster successes himself.Both of his grandfathers were studio executives, including Louis Mayer, the head of MGM – who’d playfully bite his grandson’s arm when he visited the studio, pretending to be the iconic MGM lion, Selznick grins in the documentary.His father, David Selznick, was the award-winning producer of Gone With The Wind.‘My parents didn’t insist that I go into the film business they said, you know, “You can choose it if you like, but we won’t be unhappy if you don’t choose it.”’          The campus, open to residents age 70 and over, offers impressive facilities the grounds include acres of walking paths, rose gardens, a community greenhouse, a putting green, dining options, a café, lounges and game rooms  Actress Anne Faulkner, right, played a recurring role as the boss of Roseanne Barr on the ribald comedian’s titular sitcom, left, appearing in most scenes alongside a young George Clooney – who, to this day, lights up when he sees her          Screenwriter Tony Lawrence, right, who worked on projects ranging from The Twilight Zone to Bonanza, moved to the MPTF Home with his wife more than a decade ago.

After the elder Selznick’s death, however, ‘I felt badly about the fact that I’d never worked in motion pictures,’Selznick was 28, and he took a job at Universal Studios, working in ‘a new unit for low-budget movies that will appeal to the younger audiences under 30.’ One of the films Selznick selected was a screenplay by two USC students, attached to an up-and-coming director – named George Lucas. The film was American Graffiti.‘The film cost $750,000 and ended up grossing $60million,’ Selznick says in the documentary, proudly proclaiming it the ‘highest percentage in the history of Hollywood of budget to gross to this day. And so George became a star overnight.‘Then he was invited to go to 20th Century Fox to make Star Wars – so you can say the rest is history.’He ended up at the MPTF home after the sudden death of his wife.‘A number of my friends kind of converged on me and said, “Daniel, why don’t you move to the Motion Picture Relief Fund?” It took a little bit of persuading, but not too much,’ he says in the documentary.While many of the residents, such as Selznick and Sawyer, come to the home alone, the facility is also open to spouses of industry professionals, even if they work in different fields producer Joel Rogosin, for example, lives there with his wife, Deborah, a psychotherapist. The hilarious pair are heavily featured in the documentary as they work on a book together offering advice to other couples on how to stay married (they can’t agree on the title, which is delaying publication.)Screenwriter Tony Lawrence, who worked on projects ranging from The Twilight Zone to Bonanza, moved to the MPTF Home with his wife more than a decade ago.

Kelly suggested during the interview that the woman\u0027s parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.A lawyer for the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years and asked Kelly to make her available to talk to them.\u0027At no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,\u0027 attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.CBS said it interviewed Kelly for 80 minutes. More of the interview is expected to air Thursday.          Azriel Clary, 21, (left) and Joycelyn Savage, 23, (right) also gave an interview that will air on Friday where they defend the singer and say their parents, who have been publicly fighting for them to come home, are lying.

They have been publicly campaigning for years for the singer to be brought to justice and for their daughter to come back to them In an excerpt that aired Tuesday night, Kelly told King that allegations of him having sex with and abusing underage girls were \u0027not true.\u0027 He called them \u0027rumors.\u0027 When King asked Kelly if he has held women against their will, he replied, \u0027That\u0027s stupid!\u0027\u0027Use your common sense. Forget the blogs, forget how you feel about me,\u0027 Kelly said. \u0027How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I\u0027ve been through - oh right now I just think I need to be a monster and hold girls against their will, chain them up in my basement, and don\u0027t let them eat, and don\u0027t let them out.\u0027King told Kelly that he seemed to be \u0027playing the victim card.\u0027\u0027I\u0027m just telling the truth,\u0027 he replied. He said he was emotional \u0027because this is the first time I was able to say something.\u0027Kelly noted his acquittal in the child porn case and accused prosecutors of trying the same case again.\u0027When you beat something, you beat it. You can\u0027t double jeopardy me like that. It\u0027s not fair,\u0027 he said.Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for two Kelly accusers, responded to Kelly\u0027s double jeopardy comment Tuesday on Twitter.\u0027He fails to understand that it doesn\u0027t matter \u0027how long ago\u0027 it happened. And he also has no clue as to how \u0027double jeopardy\u0027 works,\u0027 the attorney tweeted.In a follow-up tweet, Avenatti addressed the emotion that Kelly shows in the interview: \u0027R. Kelly\u0027s tears are out of fear and despair. Because he knows that after over two decades of sexually abusing underage girls, we blew this wide open and have him and his enablers dead to rights.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Chances super soft Brexit deal increase Labour bid woo Tories Norway style agreement","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn discussed the idea of a Norway-style deal with the EU with a cross-party group of MPs Chief Whip Julian Smith warned the Cabinet on Tuesday that Parliament would ‘try to force the Government into a customs union’ if the deal is defeated next week.

Photograph: Toby MelvilleReutersBritish prime minister Theresa May’s government was defeated in the House of Lords on Wednesday night over an amendment that would oblige Britain to seek to remain in a customs union with the European Union after Brexit.The amendment to a trade Bill had the support of opposition parties and independent or cross-bench peers in the upper house, where the government does not have a majority. It passed by 207 votes to 141 - a majority of 66.Speaking ahead of the debate, Labour’s shadow international trade minister in the Lords, Wilf Stevenson, urged the government to abandon its negotiating red lines and support the amendment.“Labour has consistently made the case for the UK to negotiate a new customs union with the EU – one that would protect jobs and secure opportunities for our industries, as well as remove the need for a hard border in Ireland. This approach commands wide support around the country and would give everyone some much-needed certainty about our future should we leave the EU,” he said.Earlier, DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told MPs that putting a time limit on the Northern Ireland backstop would have the effect of removing it from the withdrawal agreement. Mr Wilson told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee that his party could vote for Mrs May’s Brexit deal if the backstop was time-limited.“I’m only telling you what the EU have said and what the Irish Government have said: once you do that, you have removed the backstop. If they didn’t want to have the withdrawal agreement totally destroyed, you could remove the backstop by imposing a time limit on it. That in effect has the same outcome – there is no backstop,” he said.Mr Wilson was speaking after talks in Brussels between Britain’s attorney general Geoffrey Cox and Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier failed to make progress. The EU has ruled out imposing a time limit on the backstop and hopes for a breakthrough have focused instead on strengthening an arbitration mechanism to determine when the backstop is no longer necessary.ArbitrationMr Wilson said the DUP, whose support for the Brexit deal is viewed as crucial to persuading Conservative Eurosceptics to vote for it, could not accept arbitration as a solution.“That certainly is not a mechanism which we would accept, and I think for two reasons. First of all, that leaves us in exactly the same position as the current withdrawal agreement does, where somebody else decides whether the United Kingdom can break out of the backstop or whether it stays in the backstop. Whether we decide to alter the backstop or alter any arrangements we have with the EU should be the decision of this parliament and this government, not some independent panel of judges. And the second thing is an arbitration panel could drag on its deliberations for years,” he said.“We have made it very clear that there has to be an ability for a sovereign parliament and a sovereign government to make a decision about the future status of the United Kingdom as a whole in relation to the EU or part of the United Kingdom in relation to the EU.”MPs will vote next week on Mrs May’s Brexit deal and if they reject it, they can choose between leaving the EU without a deal or seeking an extension to the article 50 negotiating deadline.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

But the DUP’s Westminster leader now looks set to be a central player in determining if there is a way for the UK out of the Brexit quagmire.In April 2013, he was carted off to hospital by ambulance when he collapsed at work at Westminster. Months later on the Twelfth of July he was knocked unconscious when struck by a brick hurled by a loyalist rioter during one of the regular parades disputes in north Belfast.But the biggest blow that he, his MEP wife Diane and two surviving children suffered was in 1998 when his eight-year-old son Andrew, who suffered from spina bifida, died unexpectedly.Two years earlier when Dodds was visiting Andrew at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, the IRA carried out a gun attack, wounding one of his police guards. The officer recovered from the injuries suffered in what Dodds described as a “grotesque” incident. The IRA said the attack was not against the politician, but rather the RUC.“I have no way of knowing if that is true or not,” says Dodds in his north Belfast office ahead of a flight to London for another bout of very serious Brexit politics. “But certainly a lot of people are convinced that it was more than just the police officers the IRA was targeting.”The memories of Andrew are alive and strong for all the family. “He brought a lot of joy to people. He was very outgoing. Death was very sudden, it was a big shock to us . . . You never get over that, you live with it.”Dodds started his political career as Ian Paisley’s chief aide in the European Parliament where the late DUP leader was an MEP.“Andrew was a very bright wee boy. He had no inhibitions about going up to people and speaking to them. Ian Paisley used to think this was hilarious. He enjoyed a bit of joshing with him.”‘Moral bankruptcy’Dodds says the juxtaposition of the 1996 attack with doctors and nurses caring for gravely ill children and parents visiting those children demonstrated the “absolute moral bankruptcy of the IRA and what they were about”.But still that experience didn’t prevent him and the DUP going into the Northern Executive with Sinn Féin. He says he would be happy to do so again if the powersharing administration could be reinstated.For years there appeared to be a natural succession chart framed on the wall of DUP headquarters: Ian Paisley, then Peter Robinson and then Dodds, but instead he surprisingly swerved away from the leadership when Robinson stood down in 2015, Arlene Foster taking over instead.His argument remains that it did not make sense to be leader when he was over at Westminster as an MP rather than at Stormont as an Assembly member where most Northern Ireland business was done. Some wondered did those knocks convince him he did not need the stress of the leadership. Not so, says Dodds.Regardless, he is under pressure again. He is the DUP leader in the House of Commons and in a real sense one of the most powerful politicians in Britain. The DUP holds the balance of power and how he and his fellow nine DUP MPs vote in next week’s Brexit vote or votes may decide if there is some resolution to the Brexit conundrum. There is a hint of movement. Over recent days he has been pivotal to an initiative portrayed as an olive branch from hardline Brexiteers to Theresa May. He was selected as one of eight lawyers for Jacob Rees Mogg’s hardline European Research Group (ERG) deputed to propose some compromise that could reconcile the bitterly conflicting positions of Leavers and Remainers.That work continues apace and probably will run to the eleventh hour and maybe a bit beyond as well. That’s about finding a solution that ensures no hard border on the island of Ireland and doesn’t dilute, as unionists claim is inherent in the backstop, Northern Ireland’s constitutional position within the United Kingdom.How to square that circle has baffled great political and legal minds. “There is definitely a way through this. Whether there are people in Brussels and Dublin who are prepared to make changes remains to be seen,” says Dodds.He argues that Michel Barnier and Leo Varadkar would need to be in the mood for accommodation as well, and reflects on how ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum the then British prime minister David Cameron was sent home from Brussels with his tail between his legs when he sought concessions to try to carry the Remain case.“If history were to repeat itself I think Europe might be much more favourably disposed to a David Cameron-like ask,” he says.Dodds was born in 1958 in the same Waterside General Hospital in Derry as another DUP MP Gregory Campbell – “I’m not sure what you can draw from that,” he offers. His late father Joe – who was a DUP councillor in Fermanagh – was a customs officer. They then moved to Enniskillen where Dodds spent most of his boyhood, attending Portora Royal School. He went to Cambridge in 1977 to study law, emerging with a first. Initially, Cambridge was a shock. “I came from Fermanagh, never having been out of Northern Ireland much, into this very grand institution, feeling very much an inferiority complex as very many people form Northern Ireland do coming to these sorts of places.“But I very soon realised that actually we were as good as anyone else there. I enjoyed the stimulus, the debates, the political activity, the legal challenge – it was like opening up a whole new world to me. I enjoyed it immensely.”He also enjoyed the break from the Troubles. He returned, however, for a year to Queen’s to prepare for what probably would have been a lucrative life at the bar. It was there he met his wife Diana who was studying history, and as an MEP should shortly be out of a job.His mother Doreen still occasionally muses, as does he, what life would have been like if he had taken the legal rather than the political path. “I got the offer to work with Ian in the European Parliament which was a fabulous opportunity. Once I took that route it meant the law took second place. Politics is either in your blood or it is not.”Incendiary quotesChatting to Dodds you don’t get the same lively and often incendiary quotes you can readily elicit from Sammy Wilson. Dodds is the soft cop in this project. Equally he has survived in the brutal sectarian cockpit of North Belfast where against Sinn Féin encroachment he has held his House of Commons seat since 2001. So, he can fight dirty. But generally he is considered and measured in his comments.He allows, up to a point, that the DUP’s staunch line on Brexit has helped give rise to the civic nationalist movement.In the past year former DUP leader Peter Robinson made a couple of key speeches advising unionists to be mindful of demographic changes and how it was vital for them to achieve rapprochement with nationalism.“Unionists would be wise not to disregard what he is saying,” agrees Dodds. But notwithstanding the tumult of the UK quitting the EU he believes the position is retrievable once Brexit is resolved – if that is possible. And he believes too that unionism, so to speak, “gets it” – that it is not unattuned to the shifting political zeitgeist.“I don’t think anyone in unionism today fails to grasp the fact that we do need to work together, that we need to have a powersharing government, that we need to have a good relationship North and South, and we need to have a situation where people are comfortable with Northern Ireland and the union.“Brexit has changed some of the dynamic but I am reasonably optimistic that once we work through our period of uncertainty and the worst of the fears that are out there on all sides, that we can begin to get that consensus in Northern Ireland.”Dodds is 60 now. He understands, based on experience, that as you get older you must be mindful of the pressures and the problems they can cause – you have to look after your health. “But I feel fine,” he says. “There are a lot of challenges that I have to see through. I will carry on for a while yet. There is a lot of work to be done still and I am privileged to be part of that.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Piotr Nowak When the European Commission announced recently it would block the merger of rail\u0026nbspgiants Alstom and Siemens, it was acting out of concern the link-up would lead to higher prices for signalling systems and high-speed trains in Europe. \u0026nbspBoth companies already dominate their respective French and German markets and the merger, it was argued, would merely squeeze out competitors\u0026nbspin the European rail industry.Competition regulation in defence of European consumers is among the most important powers of the commission and among the most fiercely contested by businesses and member states stymied by it. And at the moment the commission’s competition directorate is run by a particularly fearless champion of its role, Danish commissioner Margrethe Vestager. Now France, and, perhaps less enthusiastically, Germany, upset at the commission decision, are calling for a radical reappraisal of the EU’s competition policy, one that would in effect prioritise the interests of giant companies\u0026nbsp– “industrial champions” – on the global stage over those of EU consumers. \u0026nbspIn the Alstom-Siemens case, at issue is the ability of the merged company to compete internationally with China’s powerful CRRC, the world’s biggest rail conglomerate in terms of sales with an annual revenue of about €30 billion. It has had relatively little success, however, outside China. Chancellor Angela Merkel complained that the EU’s stance on competition “leaves me in doubt about whether we can really produce global players this way”. ‘European champion’“We will not succeed without a European champion that’s capable of investing, innovating and keeping value-add at home. We should change European competition rules to defend our interests,” France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said. Only five European firms are in the world’s 40 biggest companies, a joint statement arguing for a new European industrial strategy noted. The new Franco-German pro posal would give member states the right to override the commission’s antitrust decisions in “well-defined cases”. A political veto for ministers.But critics warn that that could be a recipe for the gradual defanging of competition policy in the interest of large member states and giant corporations. Politicians can be subject to intense lobbying by large firms and industry organisations more interested in limiting competition than promoting it.\u0026nbspThe independence of the commission’s expert service, they argue, is the best guarantor of consumer protection – a view that chimes strongly with Ireland’s longstanding defence of the commission’s role as the defender of the rights of small states.\u0026nbspThe argument that the EU’s competition authority is too intrusive would appear to belie the reality that the commission clears the vast majority of mergers without requiring companies to take remedial steps to address competition concerns. In 2018 it approved 370 mergers unconditionally, and a further 23 with conditions (or “commitments”) attached. It blocked only two mergers in 2017, none in 2018, and fewer than 30 since the EU merger regulation was adopted in 1990.Industrial strategyNot that the Franco-German proposal will fly – it would require a proposal from the commission and some support from other member states, of which diplomats suggest there is precious little. It will certainly not be supported by Ireland.More broadly, however, the initiative has to be seen in the context of a wider debate about giving the European Union an industrial strategy. Among the issues being debated by the 18-member-state Friends of Industry grouping is the identification and support of “strategic value chains” – bringing Europe-wide assistance to every stage in the production of items such as car batteries from mining to car sales.Among other proposals being promoted are ideas about reframing the EU’s state aid and competition rules to allow funds to be directed to areas where innovation needs a helping hand or where “market failures” occur.

For others it is nothing more than a desire to get through airport security more quickly.Tony Flemming, a Manchester native whose mother came from Athlone, voted to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum. He applied for Irish citizenship last year.“I want to go on holiday to Europe, and it would be easier with an Irish passport,” Flemming (73) says. “And the second reason I got it was just to see if I could.“I will use my Irish passport on the journey out and then switch to my British passport when returning home, so it’s quicker through security.”Despite being the new owner of a European travel document, Flemming said he “never wanted to be part of the ‘German empire’.”He added, “I’ve been hoping for Brexit for a long time. I just want to get out and get it sorted.”His children voted to remain in the EU.“My children have said I’m hypocritical,” said Flemming. “I think it’s perfectly normal to take advantage of a system if the option is there.”He was once a regular visitor to Ireland, but the last trip was during the 1966 World Cup. However, his dual citizenship is intended for sunnier travels.“I like to go to Gibraltar, so my British passport will be fine until I walk over to Spain, and then I’ll use my Irish one.”Flemming is not alone. Last year the passport service received 200,000 applications from British-based people directly to Dublin or through its office in London – although the largest share are for the children of Irish-born citizens living in Britain.‘This has opened up my Irish roots’Jim Greer (56), a social work lecturer from Scotland, spent €250 accumulating his grandmother’s birth, marriage and death certificates and a further €278 on an application for Irish citizenship.“Ireland was the only EU country I was eligible to apply for. I didn’t actually realise I was eligible until Brexit happened,” he says.Living in Scotland, where 62 per cent of residents voted to remain, Greer pursued Irish citizenship as a “symbol of resistance to Brexit”.“It is just not my outlook at all,” he says. “It feels less like we’re being dragged out of the EU as we’re being dragged into some English flag-waving, spitfire era.His paternal grandmother grew up in Ballymena, Co Antrim, before moving across to the west coast of Scotland.“She was actually a very staunch Protestant, so she would be turning in her grave right now,” says Greer, who visited Northern Ireland many times in his youth but has yet to set foot in the Republic.He spent six months learning about the country, listening to the Irish Passport Podcast, a series to educate aspiring Irish citizens on the country’s culture, history and politics.“I’ve found a new dimension. I always thought of myself as Scottish, but this has opened up my Irish roots. I might even consider living there.”‘Brexit doesn’t feel like such a big issue to me now’Londoners Rachel and Bill Bohling got their Irish passports at the same time as their mother, Cathy, who grew up in Co Tyrone.“We were quite delayed as a family in getting them, as we’ve been entitled to one all our lives,” says Rachel (26). “Our mum was very emotionally involved. She was pushing us to get them ever since Brexit.”With her boyfriend living in Paris, Rachel’s new passport gave her the confidence to look into transferring offices to France.“Brexit doesn’t feel like such a big issue to me now. I don’t think it can impact me the way it could before.”While Bill (31) has no immediate plans, having an Irish passport keeps the door to Europe open.“I personally love being European and having that option to travel,” he said.He speaks fondly about family trips to Ireland, where they visited relatives north and south of the Border.“I’ve always felt very appreciative of my mum’s heritage. That Irish root is very important to me. I’m a proud British and Irish citizen.”‘My mum jokes that I never cared about being Irish until now’Self-confessed pessimist Matthew Modlinsky (44) applied for an Irish passport just two weeks after the Brexit referendum.“I like to be prepared for the worst,” says Modlinsky, a transport co-ordinator. “I’m even stocking up on food now: cans of chickpeas, tinned tomatoes, nothing perishable.”His mother moved from Monaghan to Manchester when she was 16.“It’s just pure luck that my mum is Irish. I see other people who feel the same as me who aren’t as lucky.”His mother goes back each year to see family, but Modlinsky has visited the island just once.“My mum jokes that I never cared about being Irish until now. I know that’s terrible. Now that I’m an Irish citizen I should go more. I do plan to go.”A keen traveller, he hopes his new passport will make European trips easy. In the long-term, he plans to retire to France or Spain.“I don’t want to be restricted in what I do. That’s the travesty of it all. It’s not my generation, it’s the younger generation who are having an opportunity taken away from them.”‘I’ve enjoyed the freedoms of the EU for so long’Although Amy McCollam (40) only applied for her passport last year, she began researching Irish citizenship long before Brexit.“Ireland is a big part of me it’s home. I did all my important growing up there,” she said.When she was 13 her family moved to Ballymena, her father’s hometown. She lived there for seven years, before returning to England to study.Now, McCollam lives in Reading and is applying for Irish citizenship for her daughter, Keira, through foreign birth registration.“I want her to understand part of where she comes from,” said McCollam. “I’ve enjoyed the freedoms of the EU for so long and I love it, so I want her to have it.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

They said she was a special dog, that she brought luck to the expedition,” Mr Wargowsky said. “Some even thought she was blessed.”At one point Mera spent two nights sleeping out exposed on a glacier leading Mr Wargowsky to fear she would die of cold. But she seemed unharmed and later shared his tent and ate his food.On the day of the final ascent, he said she seemed unconcerned by the altitude or precipices on either side and bounded ahead of the group.“I have no clue if she’d been up there before, but she seemed very confident in what she was doing,” he said.She ran ahead of him on the final ridge approaching the summit and waited for him panting with her tongue out, he said.“I’d never been on top of something like that with a dog. She was leaning up against me and wanting to be petted.

He has also worked for the Miami Herald, ABC, CBC and South Florida TV station WPLG Local 10, among others.Neighbours of Weddle who witnessed the raid said he was arrested on an order signed by a military tribunal, the National Press Workers Union reported. His computer and other work equipment were also seized.Marco Ruiz, the union’s president, said that according to the witnesses, the pair were accused of two crimes - espionage and treason.US senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott of Florida expressed outrage at the detention, Mr Scott saying the US would “not stand for this intimidation”.The director of the US-based Human Rights Watch, Jose Miguel Vivanco, said it was very worrying, adding that the desperate regime of Mr Maduro was doing the only thing it knows how to do: repress and censor.  Luis Almagro, secretary-general of the Organisation of American States, castigated the oppressive usurper regime of Venezuela”, calling for an “end to the intimidation and censorship of journalists in the country. Venezuelan security forces have detained 49 reporters, some of them briefly, so far this year, according to Espacio Publico, a press monitoring organisation.The group is investigating the circumstances of Weddle\u0027s detention but had yet to receive any explanation from authorities, a representative told The .Soldiers unleash tear gas during trouble at Venezuela border, in picturesAnalysts warned that the arrest could draw a forceful response from the US, which has raised the prospect of military intervention and yesterday revoked 77 visas of iniduals linked to the Maduro government.Given the current state of relations between the US and Venezuela, having military intelligence arrest a US citizen.... seems like unnecessary provocation, said Phil Gunsion of the NGO Crisis Group.Further inflaming the international crisis, Venezuela yesterday ordered the German ambassador, Daniel Kriener, to leave the country within 48 hours, accusing him of  “recurrent acts of interference in the country\u0027s internal affairs. The move sets up a three-way diplomatic standoff between the Maduro regime, Mr Guaidó, and Berlin.Heiko Maas, the German minister for foreign affairs, said Europe\u0027s support for Mr Guaidó was unbreakable and said the decision would escalate the situation.Mr Guaidó described the order as a threat against Germany and insisted Mr Kriener should stay in his post.Mr Kriener was one of 13 ambassadors who went to Caracas’s airport to greet Mr Guaidó as he returned on Monday under threat of arrest, raising the prospect that the expulsion of other envoys could follow.In a bid to entrench his leadership, Mr Guaidó has this week nominated his own envoys to several of the countries that recognise him, including to Germany, which has said it is studying the request.He has also reached out to public sector workers, appealing them to abandon the government which has long demanded their unwavering support.Please review our commenting policyCyber attacks rob future elections of their legitimacy, Jeremy Hunt warnsTrendy peanut butter snacks contain \u0026#39as many calories as a meal\u0026#39Public satisfaction over the NHS is lowest in a decade, despite £20bn ‘birthday boost’Male rape TV dramas have helped fuel a surge in sexual assault cases, Government revealsNo charges in Grenfell criminal probe before 2021, police say Delay digital tax reforms to avoid chaos, Phillip Hammond urged Senator Martha McSally reveals she was raped in the air force in emotional testimonyCountess of Wessex teams up with Angelina Jolie to end rape and sexual violence in war zones Spain is blocking attempts to reach a compromise over Brexit backstop as part of \u0026#39land grab\u0026#39 for GibraltarComment: Knee-jerk demands for more police and stop-and-search won\u0026#39t end knife crimeDominic Grieve hosts French minister for discussions on Article 50 and second referendumBrexit deal \u0026#39will be defeated by 100 votes\u0026#39, ministers believe, after talks in Brussels collapsePrince William says Army must demand both mental and physical fitness if it wants to legitimately claim to \u0026#39be the best\u0026#39Olympian James Cracknell in training for Oxbridge boat race, after taking up Masters in philosophyThe man behind \u0026#39woke\u0026#39 Twitter account Titania McGrath: \u0026#39People are sick of feeling that they can’t say what they want\u0026#39Police plan £10m surge in extra officers - as they get new stop and search powers to combat knife crime epidemicFourth suspicious package linked to \u0026#39dissident\u0026#39 letter bomb campaign, police confirmDemocrats split over resolution condemning anti-Semitism aimed at newcomer Ilhan OmarSpanish cemetery accused of lying about cremating 3,000 Franco victims as rains expose mass graveWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/06/15/iphone.jpg","title":"apple supply chain document iphone airpods homepod zero waste","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

It describes those developments as creating a ripple effect that drives change among other technology companies.Apple has in recent years looked to highlight its efforts to look after the employees who work for the companies who supply important parts of its products. Though those people do not work for Apple, they are included in the efforts to ensure that staff are healthy and happy, and benefit from educational and other programmes.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

It also points to breakthroughs in its environmental work, which not only helps keep the process green but also ensures those working for\u0026nbspits suppliers and living near them are not affected by dangerous chemicals that are created when working with metals and other materials.Apple will finally fix iPhones even if they have a third-party battery“In everything we do, people come first,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “We are constantly raising the bar for ourselves and our suppliers, because we are committed to the people who make our products possible, as well as the planet we all share.This year, we’re proud to give more people an opportunity to advance their education. Working alongside our suppliers, we\u0027re challenging ourselves to find new ways to keep our planet healthy for future generations. Our goal has always been not just to drive progress in our supply chain, but to drive meaningful changes across the industry.”Changes made by Apple in 2018 include work to help Apple\u0027s supplier employees receive education in coding for the products they help make, in addition to existing programmes. Last year, it started offering app development courses that saw people create more than 40 apps, it said, and helped more than 1,500 employees earn a college degree.That is in addition to the training that helps people learn more basic skills, such as nutrition and\u0026nbspmaternal health.In 2018, it also worked to conserve resources within its supply chain, it said. It has prioritised a programme it calls Zero Waste to Landfill, which means that many of its biggest products are now made in a way that stops garbage as well as limiting waste of other materials like water.The iPhone was already certified as part of that programme. Now the\u0026nbspiPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods and HomePod\u0026nbspare also part of it.That work is measured through assessments that are carried out by both Apple and outside auditors.It says those found that 76 per cent of\u0026nbspsupplier faculties are high performing, and 1 per cent are low performing. That is equal to a 30 per cent increase in high performing suppliers.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In its latest economic outlook, the OECD said growth is expected to remain weak in the UK for the foreseeable future. Based on a smooth Brexit and a transition period lasting until the end of 2020, the OECD has forecast GDP growth of below 1 per cent in the next two years. However, a no-deal Brexit would reduce GDP by around 2 per cent in the UK for the next two years. The OECD said: “The effects could be stronger still if a lack of adequate border infrastructure and a loss of access to EU trade arrangements with third countries were to cause serious bottlenecks in integrated cross-border supply chains.”The group said the costs associated with a cliff-edge departure from the EU could be magnified by a further decline in business and financial market confidence and disruption in financial markets.

Meanwhile, the think tank said the impact of trade arrangements on WTO terms would vary across the EU, with smaller countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark “relatively exposed”. The biggest impact would be felt in the agriculture, machinery and equipment sectors. The OECD’s predictions echo previous warnings from the Bank of England, which last year said a no deal could plunge the UK into a larger recession that the global financial crisis 10 years ago if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead. Based on the bank’s worst case scenario modelling, the UK economy would contract by 8 per cent, house prices would fall by a third, unemployment would spike to 7.5 per cent, interest rates would shoot up to 5.5 per cent and the value of the pound would fall to below $1.We’ll tell you what’s true.

What will these votes mean for the UK economy, jobs and wages?\u0026nbspThe Brexit vote has hit growth. There is a strong consensus that, to date, the UK economy is perhaps 1 to 2 per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been (and, correspondingly, real household incomes are 1 to 2 per cent\u0026nbsplower).\u0026nbspThat was mostly down to the impact of the fall in the pound in the immediate aftermath of the referendum.More recently, growth in the final quarter of 2018 was 0.2 per cent – weak, but not disastrous. But the most up-to-date data is considerably worse looking at the monthly data, there’s been essentially no growth since the summer. Part of this reflects global economic developments – the eurozone economy is also weak.Created with Sketch.

I fear elements of the Brexit white paper will inevitably put me in direct conflict with the views expressed by a large section of my constituents. I am not prepared to compromise their wishes to deliver a watered-down Brexit.But there are obvious Brexit effects as well, in particular the slowdown in business investment and a record rise in “stockpiling”, as factories try desperately to ensure that they won’t run short of vital components if trade is disrupted by a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit. \u0026nbspIf no deal actually materialises, it seems likely we’d see a further significant fall in sterling, pushing up import prices and inflation, and reducing real wages.\u0026nbspConsiderably more worrying, however, would be the impact\u0026nbspon consumer and business confidence, and hence spending. Businesses would be hit by rising input prices, resulting both from the fall in sterling and the need to replace EU imports with more expensive ones sourced from outside the EU.Consumers would face rising inflation at a time when they will be trying to reduce discretionary spending, and with little prospect of large pay rises. Any actual disruption to business activities, through the disruption of supply chains or cutting off access to EU export markets, would come on top of this – and could be very severe indeed.To some extent, these could and would be mitigated by policy actions from the UK government. The Bank of England would be likely to raise interest rates more slowly than it otherwise would have done. And although the deficit will widen if the economy slows, the government will –\u0026nbspvery sensibly –\u0026nbsprespond to that as Gordon Brown did in 2008 by spending more, not less. The government has learnt\u0026nbspfrom George Osborne’s mistakes.\u0026nbspNo-deal Brexit could push UK into recession, think tank warnsWould all this mean a recession?\u0026nbspI’d be very surprised if it doesn’t – and indeed I’ve put my money where my mouth is, but it will of course depend crucially on political developments.If the UK and the EU keep talking and try to minimise the damage, we might get away with a relatively limited downturn. If things spiral out of control with tit-for-tat measures, then it could be very grim indeed.Over the longer term, it will be the future trading arrangements between the UK and the EU27 (and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the world) that determines the long-term economic impact\u0026nbspof Brexit.\u0026nbspUnder no deal, the UK and the EU would revert to trading under rules governed by World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements, although the default assumption must be that when the dust settles, various bilateral agreements to facilitate trade within the WTO framework would likely be agreed.\u0026nbspCredible estimates of the long-term impact of this on the UK economy suggest that it would reduce output by up to 10 per cent. And – unlike the inherently unpredictable short-term consequences of a “chaotic Brexit”\u0026nbsp– these can be modelled quantitatively using standard economic models.The government’s own estimates are that this would reduce GDP and wages by 8-10 per cent\u0026nbspover the next 15 years.\u0026nbspOf course, whatever happens with Brexit, many other factors – including UK domestic economic policy – will drive economic growth between 2018 and 2033.The expectation is still that the UK economy will continue to grow. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that a hard\u0026nbspBrexit would prove a significant drag on growth over the medium to long term.What about if the deal is passed? Business will undoubtedly breath a sigh of relief as the immediate threat of no deal is lifted. But while the government claims that the deal offers business certainty, that is only true only in the short term, and only by comparison to the chaos of no deal. A transition period will guarantee the status quo until at least the end of 2020, but we still know little about what happens after that.\u0026nbspThe deal sets out a broad framework – the “political declaration” for the future relationship between the UK and the EU – but only a framework, which is not binding on either side. And given that political instability both in the UK and continental Europe seems far more likely than not, it is unclear how much it will constrain negotiations.\u0026nbspWhat is certain is that just, as in the Article 50 negotiations, the UK will have by far the weaker hand, and will need to make big concessions on issues from fish to financial services.Sterling would rise and confidence would recover to more normal levels, but the long-term question marks over the UK economy and its access to European markets would remain. For these reasons forecasts of a “Brexit boom” after a deal seem misplaced it’s more likely to be a “dead cat bounce”. Particularly given that – for reasons that have nothing to do with Brexit – world trade growth is already slowing, UK growth seems likely to remain fairly disappointing this year.What about the long-term impact\u0026nbspof May’s deal?\u0026nbspAssuming that the future relationship is indeed based on the customs backstop written into the withdrawal agreement, then there will be no tariffs on UK-EU trade, no customs checks at the border and no need for firms to satisfy rules of origin requirements. All good news, especially for manufacturing. However, for the UK’s dominant service\u0026nbspsector – 80 per cent\u0026nbspof the economy, nearly half of exports to the EU, and almost certainly the main driver of future export growth – the news is much worse.\u0026nbspLeaving the single market will mean substantial new barriers to UK companies, and there is little or nothing in the political declaration to suggest we will get much in the way of special treatment.\u0026nbspAnd we are not just talking about the City and financial services here, but a whole range of sectors from broadcasting to transport. Indeed, while UK manufactures are furious with the government’s handling of the negotiations, most economists find it even more baffling that the UK government has essentially done nothing to protect the interest of some of the most dynamic and successful sectors of the UK economy.Nor are trade deals with non-EU countries likely to make up the difference.\u0026nbspRecent days have shown how large the obstacles will be to any UK-US trade deal, which would inevitably involve major concessions by the UK in politically difficult areas – not just chlorinated chicken.\u0026nbspIndeed, the UK is likely to be in a considerably weaker position in negotiating such deals than it would be within the EU.\u0026nbspSo the overall impact of May’s deal, while considerably smaller than no deal, will still be negative – the government’s estimates, which may be optimistic, are of a hit to GDP of 2 to 4 per cent our own estimates are 2 per cent\u0026nbspto 5.5 per cent. And if Theresa May is replaced by a more hardline Brexiteer who seeks to negotiate his or her way out of the backstop, and hence a customs union, the prognosis will be considerably worse – much closer to the no-deal scenario.\u0026nbspWhat this means is that while no deal is clearly worse for the economy than the deal on the table, and comes with further unpredictable downsides, there are big negatives to Theresa May’s deal both continued uncertainty for the next couple of years and the likelihood of a very damaging outcome for important parts of the UK economy, leading to a significant drag on growth for the medium term.And finally, what if we “kick the can” and seek an extension of the Article 50 process? In the short term, this is the outcome which maximises uncertainty, since nothing will be resolved.\u0026nbspMost businesses would nevertheless prefer it to the certain downsides of no deal but it clearly is not a solution.During the period of extension, businesses would still have to plan for the possibility of no deal, even while hoping for something better. If – and this is of course a big if – it led to a softer\u0026nbspBrexit, which at least left open the possibility of continued customs union and single market membership (including freedom of movement) then the long-term economic downsides of Brexit would largely vanish.\u0026nbspBut if it simply leads to a delayed no deal, or a slightly tweaked version of the same deal, then it’s hard to see what we would gain.So our MPs are in a bind.\u0026nbspThere is no option that will resolve the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over the UK economy any time soon, and none which can credibly claim to avert the risk of substantial long-term damage.\u0026nbspThe chancellor famously claimed that “no one voted to be poorer”. Maybe, maybe not. But next week most of our elected representatives will almost certainly – one way or the other – do just that.\u0026nbspJonathan Portes is a senior fellow at academic think tank UK in a Changing Europe and professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But it is.\u0026nbspThe Access to Cash Review\u0026nbspwas put together by an independent panel of financial experts with the work funded by, but independent of, Link, which operates the UK’s network of cash machines.It’s authoritative, raises some important points, and also (crucially) floats some ideas for tackling them.\u0026nbspUK’s cash system in danger of ‘collapse’, leaving millions strugglingOne in five Brits have a ‘side hustle’ to make extra cash, says studyUK companies hoarding cash ahead of Brexit, new data showsThe reason why it’s a Brexit issue is this: will any of those points get the attention they deserve paid to them by a crisis-wracked government focused on just that one thing?\u0026nbspThe rapid decline in the use of cash ought to be an issue for the Treasury, which should be well aware of it. The issue has also been raised by the Payment Systems Regulator (repeatedly)\u0026nbspthe Financial Conduct Authority, which considered access to bank branches and ATMs in its Financial Lives of Consumers last year\u0026nbspand a variety of other organisations.\u0026nbspSome of the brighter sparks in the civil service congregate around Number 11 Downing Street, and they will doubtless be cognisant of the fact that the inability to use cash will pose a serious a problem for some groups the poor, the elderly, those living in rural areas where broadband connections are lousy, hampering the use of recent technological innovations.\u0026nbspThe problem is that the crisis is a looming one. There is still time before it becomes full blown. Given that the government’s time horizon currently doesn’t extend much beyond getting through the day without yet another disaster of its own making crashing down on its, and our, heads, it will likely feel that this is one of the many issues that can wait.\u0026nbspNo one has the faintest idea what’s happening with Brexit, businesses are screaming, and the economy is wilting. That’s before one considers the impact of a no-deal cliff edge and the fact that it could still happen, either by accident or the design of the extremists or the allies of extremists whom Chancellor Philip Hammond sits around the cabinet table with.\u0026nbspThat’s what the Treasury is focused upon, and it doesn’t have much choice.\u0026nbspEverything else is on the back burner.\u0026nbspSo you can forget consideration of the\u0026nbspreport’s\u0026nbspsuggested solutions\u0026nbsprequiring that essential services provided by utilities and councils allow for cash payments, having the banks create a body that would step in if rural communities run short, among other things. Ditto the idea\u0026nbspof creating a watchdog to safeguard cash, suggested by pressure group Positive Money.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Trouble is he doesn’t want the job.\u0026nbspThe company delivered a 44 per cent rise in sales in 2018, while pre tax profits came in at £102m against a £76m loss last time. Its preferred measure for earnings (underlying EBITDA) showed a rather more modest improvement of 6 per cent to £174m. But that was still more than handy given that this is a fast growing business facing considerable competitive pressure, notably from the likes of Deliveroo and Uber Eats, that’s investing heavily in what it does.\u0026nbspDuffy has also been credited with an improvement in margins, despite that competition, and while the shares fell today, they’ve been run up strongly over the past few weeks, so don\u0027t read too much into that.\u0026nbspJust Eat pledges to remove all restaurants with zero hygiene ratingRestaurants on Just Eat giving ‘life-threatening allergen information’The company’s acting boss is even confident that he can make money from offering a delivery service. As well as matching customers to takeaways, which handle their own deliveries, Just Eat wants to grab a bigger slice of that marketplace.\u0026nbspAs such, it’s muscling in on its rivals’ territory, working with branded restaurants to deliver food.\u0026nbspMaking money from doing that is not easy. But Duffy reckons the company can do it all the same, promising profits from Canada this year, and Australia and the UK further down the line.\u0026nbspThat’d be quite the trick.\u0026nbspDespite its achievements, however, the company finds itself in the cross hairs\u0026nbspof a US activist investor, in the form of Cat Rock. It thinks Just Eat should pursue a merger with Dutch rival Takeaway (in which Cat also holds shares) and give control of the combined business to the latter’s CEO Jitse Groen. Who\u0027s not much keen on the idea.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspActivists would be a good thing if they addressed corporate governance issues, silly pay packages for executives, and the like and sometimes they can have a positive impact on under performing businesses with bad bosses and boards.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

In its latest economic outlook, the OECD said growth is expected to remain weak in the UK for the foreseeable future. Based on a smooth Brexit and a transition period lasting until the end of 2020, the OECD has forecast GDP growth of below 1 per cent in the next two years. However, a no-deal Brexit would reduce GDP by around 2 per cent in the UK for the next two years. The OECD said: “The effects could be stronger still if a lack of adequate border infrastructure and a loss of access to EU trade arrangements with third countries were to cause serious bottlenecks in integrated cross-border supply chains.”The group said the costs associated with a cliff-edge departure from the EU could be magnified by a further decline in business and financial market confidence and disruption in financial markets.

Meanwhile, the think tank said the impact of trade arrangements on WTO terms would vary across the EU, with smaller countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark “relatively exposed”. The biggest impact would be felt in the agriculture, machinery and equipment sectors. The OECD’s predictions echo previous warnings from the Bank of England, which last year said a no deal could plunge the UK into a larger recession that the global financial crisis 10 years ago if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead. Based on the bank’s worst case scenario modelling, the UK economy would contract by 8 per cent, house prices would fall by a third, unemployment would spike to 7.5 per cent, interest rates would shoot up to 5.5 per cent and the value of the pound would fall to below $1.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The bookmaker said the name change would reflect “the increased ersity of our brands and operations”, but chief executive Peter Jackson said: “There are no plans to use this historical name for consumers.” Meanwhile, revenue was up 9 per cent, from £1.75bn to £1.87bn, while pre-tax profit dropped 11 per cent from £247m to £219m. The group said earnings were lower due to investments made in the US, and the idend was unchanged. The firm also said the new £2 stake limit for controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which comes into effect next month, will not have a material impact on its sports-led retail strategy.Created with Sketch.

However, Paddy Power said the rule changes highlighted “the importance of having sustainable earnings streams, something the group has always been committed to”.The group added that 2019 had so far matched\u0026nbspexpectations.Results showed that UK and Ireland revenues across its 626-strong estate of betting shops fell 1 per cent and underlying earnings dropped 19 per cent to £51m.However, online revenues rose 11 per cent compared with just 1 per cent in 2017.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Nearly 200 families are in limbo waiting to hear where their child will be for the start of the\u0026nbspautumn term.So why are more children missing out on places at their preferred schools? Quite simply, there are more pupils entering secondary school than in previous years, making the competition tougher.And in some cities, the provision of school places is failing to keep up with a\u0026nbsppopulation bulge which is now moving into secondary education.

Government forecasts show that secondary school pupil numbers will rise by 15 per cent over a nine-year period. The population is expected to peak at 3.3m in 2027 –\u0026nbsp418,000 more than in 2018.But not all parts of the country will experience a shortage of school places. A child’s chance of winning a place at their preferred school\u0026nbspvaries significantly depending on where they live.The problem appears to be most acute in London and its surrounding counties, as well as other cities with significant population growth.Parents to protest after children left without any school placesA recent survey suggests that only 6 per cent of children in Somerset did not get their first choice secondary school, compared to more than a third in London. And more than 700 children were left with no secondary school place at all in the capital last week.All this has angered\u0026nbspparents, who say multiple warnings were made about the baby boom and its impact on places.For a number of years, councils, schools and unions have spoken up about a potential shortage of secondary places. And yet in some areas, not enough forward planning appears to have taken place. \u0026nbspThe government says it\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspincreased the number of free schools to ensure there are enough places, but these are not always in the right areas. And some may not have not opened in time.Moreover, councils, who are responsible for making sure there are enough places, are not able to create schools. They also cannot force academies and free schools to expand to take more pupils.And it can be difficult to encourage a school to expand if they lack the space and resources to do so.State schools are struggling to pay for repairs to their existing buildings and class sizes have been rising amid squeezed budgets. Other secondary schools may be reluctant to admit more pupils due to fears that they will not have enough staff to teach and look after the children properly.With the swathe of problems facing secondary schools, we can expect more parents across the country to speak up and protest about the lack of provision over the next few years. The problem is not going away anytime soon.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write. That’s why, in an era of political lies and Brexit bias, more readers are turning to an independent source.

They were ineligible to be looked at by the Genius Bar, for instance, meaning that getting a battery replacement could mean passing up the chance for any other service work.That was the case even if the problem was with another component and not the battery, meaning that the entire phone would be banned from repairs just for having a third-party battery.But a new note seen by MacRumors shows that Apple Stores and Apple\u0027s approved service providers will be able to fix those phones.That will be the case even if the repair is related to the battery itself. It can now be swapped\u0026nbspout for one of Apple\u0027s own batteries for a standard fee.If the third-party battery change has meant that it isn\u0027t possible to get the existing battery out – if the tabs that lift it out are missing, or if it is stuck in with too much glue – then the whole phone can be replaced for the cost of a battery replacement, MacRumors\u0026nbspreported.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

They killed many of the 123 British soldiers and 42 Royal Ulster Constabulary police who died there\u0026nbspbetween 1970 and 1997. Described by British home secretary Mervyn Rees as “bandit country”, the area\u0026nbspwas so dangerous for British forces personnel that they only travelled by helicopter. \u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit: a portrait of Northern IrelandThose lethal wires linked to explosives are long gone thanks to the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) of 1998, but in a broader sense the 310-mile-long border that ides Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic itself constitutes a trip wire which, if touched or interfered with in any way, has the capacity to trigger a political explosion that could end 20 years of peace.\u0026nbspThe removal of the physical border with its hundreds of blocked and cratered roads and blown bridges, channelling traffic through a few heavily guarded military checkpoints, was an essential part of the GFA.Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalist communities, which each make up about half of the 1.9 million population of Northern Ireland, could choose to be British or Irish without either being able to dominate the other. A stable balance of power between the two was held in place by an elaborate structure of institutions and laws negotiated by the leading nationalist and unionist parties of the day and buttressed by the British and Irish governments\u0026nbspacting in cooperation along with the EU.\u0026nbspThis structure has maintained a hard-won peace for over two decades, but it is now crumbling under the impact of Brexit. The referendum of 2016 opened the way for – indeed made it difficult to avoid – the resurrection of the border as an international frontier between an Irish Republic as a member of the EU, with all its rules and regulations, and the UK determined to be outside it.\u0026nbspThe radicalism and gravity of what is proposed by the Brexiteers is masked by mumbo-jumbo about “backstops”, “hard borders”\u0026nbspand “max fac” (maximum facilitation) borders that will somehow be automatically monitored by technical gadgetry which, though\u0026nbspyet to be invented, will apparently be sure to make any human presence unnecessary.The debate about the “backstop”\u0026nbspin the UK ignores the political and demographic realities on the ground in Northern Ireland.Ryanair boss calls May and Corbyn ‘idiots’ and demands end to BrexitThe threat to a hard border is often portrayed as coming from dissident Republican groups that never accepted the GFA.But these are small, fragmented, under surveillance by MI5 and lack popular nationalist support. More likely are spontaneous protests by farmers and local people on the border determined to prevent an international frontier once again cutting through their neighbourhoods.\u0026nbspAll this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them.\u0026nbspMuch of the border runs through land populated (on both sides) by a majority of Catholics and nationalists.\u0026nbspAny new barrier would probably in practice require the deployment of military force.After all, the EU is like a club which requires porters at the door to keep non-members out\u0026nbsp– or ensure that, if they do enter, they abide by the club’s rules and regulations. In the case of\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland, s at the gate would be customs and other regulatory officials, but these could not be stationed there in the face of local nationalist opposition without police protection and the police would not come without the deployment of the British Army, which\u0026nbspwould presumably operate from a network of fortified positions,\u0026nbsppotentially even\u0026nbspblocking many of the 300 roads crossing the border – as they did in the past.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe “backstop” is portrayed as an insurance policy under which all of the UK would remain in the customs union if the UK and EU cannot agree some other way of avoiding a “hard border”. But the latter could not be recreated without reigniting the Northern Ireland conflict, something that neither nationalists nor unionists want to happen, but that might be brought about by the momentum of events, just\u0026nbspas it was in Northern Ireland in 1968-69.\u0026nbspSome supporters of Brexit argue naively that the UK government could solve the problem by allowing almost free passage of people and vehicles and relying on cooperation and goodwill to ensure that their passage, and the goods they carry, will be registered electronically.Feeney is scathing about such plans, saying: “All this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them. The rest would cross the border from Cavan and Monaghan where there are no bar codes or anything else.”Cheap but illegal Brazilian beef and American chicken would thus flood out of the UK and into the EU through the unguarded Northern Ireland breach in its defences.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.But the problem of the Irish border is not primarily about trade and commerce, important though these may be.What is really at issue here – and the “backstop” is unwittingly at the centre of this – is the shifting balance of power between the Catholics and Protestants on the island of\u0026nbspIreland.\u0026nbspBrexit may be isive in England but is even more so in Northern Ireland because it plugs into the 400-year struggle between the two communities, a historic confrontation which over the last hundred years has\u0026nbspgained its most visible expression in the island’s partition.\u0026nbspMany observers in Northern Ireland are frightened by the seeming carelessness with which the British government and the Conservative Party have presided over the rebirth of\u0026nbspthe Irish Question. They appear to ignore its toxic legacy as an issue that has bedevilled British politics from the First Home Rule Bill in 1886 until the partition of Ireland in 1921, and again during the 30-year conflict from the first Catholic civil rights march in 1968 to the GFA in 1998. \u0026nbspMowlem\u0026nbspwas instrumental in the negotiations which led to the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The latter agreement was under pressure but was working until the Brexit vote in the UK reopened old issues and old wounds. Northern Ireland voted Remain by 56 to 44 per cent but sectarian isions have widened.Why looming collapse of cash as a means of payment is a Brexit issueJust how bad tends to be underestimated in Westminster because British politicians, aside from Tony Blair, have traditionally had a blind spot about Ireland until things go irredeemably wrong and it is too late to do anything about them. The same is largely true of the British media according to commentators in Belfast.“Those that covered the conflict 20 years ago catch on pretty quickly about what is happening here,” one local journalist told me. “Those that are here for the first time are completely bewildered because they don’t know what happened in the past.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPeople who live in Northern Ireland have an acute sense of how problems that had been neutered, though\u0026nbspnot resolved, by the GFA are stirring into life.“I am grappling with the idea of a hard border which I would call a Second Partition of Ireland,” says Tom Hartley, a Sinn Fein veteran and former lord mayor of Belfast. He is baffled by British actions that appear so much against their interests, saying that “they had parked the Irish problem, but now Ireland has moved once again into the centre of British politics”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Neither the nationalist community nor Sinn Fein, which has won more than two-thirds of the nationalist vote in Northern Ireland in recent elections, wants to go back to war.Nationalists have done well out of the peace. Catholics\u0026nbspno longer face religious discrimination when it comes to jobs, housing and justice, as they did in 1968.Irish TV host tears up as she lists Troubles victims in Brexit warningSinn Fein are conscious that demographically the nationalist community is growing faster than the loyalist one:\u0026nbspalready 51 per cent of school children are Catholics compared to 37 per cent who are Protestants. Within two years, the Catholics may be the majority of the voting population, though this does not necessarily guarantee political power.I lived in Belfast between 1972 and 1975 writing a PhD about Joe Devlin, the northern nationalist leader in the first decades of the 20th century, at the Institute of Irish Studies which was part\u0026nbspof Queens University. These were the worst years of the Troubles. In 1972 alone some 479 people were killed, including 135 soldiers, and 4,876 were injured.Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement that established long term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of BrexitI got used to the sounds of bombs and gunfire and the sectarian geography of Belfast became imprinted on my brain. Along with the rest of the population, I automatically calculated the real proximity of danger without giving the matter much thought.I once showed a visiting American publisher around the city and, years later, he told me that he had been struck by one moment during our tour when he had queried me about the route we were taking, saying: “I thought you said this street was dangerous?” And I had replied, as if stating the obvious: “No, I said that that side of the street was dangerous, but the side we are on is safe.”\u0026nbspAlmost everything is safe in Belfast today, though the sectarian boundaries are largely the same as they were 50 years ago.I drove through the site of Harland and Wolff shipyard that at its peak employed 35,000 men, almost all Protestants from east Belfast. Today it is the site of the Titanic exhibition which is, along with other developments, dwarfed by the enormous yellow gantry crane marked H \u0026amp W in giant letters. Housing is, and has always been, segregated in Belfast and east Belfast remains a Protestant stronghold, aside from a small Republican nationalist enclave called Short Strand pressed up against the Lagan river. It is protected by one of the many peace lines or walls in the city topped by metal staves.“They got higher when the Protestants discovered catapults,” said a local observer, who pointed to the grills over the windows and the slates on the roofs that look normal but are made out of metal so they do not break when stones hurled over the peace wall hit them.\u0026nbspI once had a shabby flat off the Antrim Road in north Belfast, but I could not remember the name of the street. This used to be a particularly murderous part of Belfast because of the jigsaw puzzle of Protestant and Catholic districts permanently engaged in low level war against each other, most often in the shape of tit-for-tat or retaliatory killings.“Get your retaliation in first,” was an old Belfast joke, though retaliation was not necessarily local. If a Catholic was killed in Short Strand where the Catholics were weak and outnumbered, then the retaliatory killing of a Protestant might be arranged from Ardoyne, where the Catholics were strong and well organised.Likewise, if a Protestant UDR (Ulster Defence Regiment) soldier was shot by the IRA in County Fermanagh 70 miles to the west, there might be a tit-for-tat revenge murder of a Catholic in Belfast.\u0026nbspPeace may have come but militant commemorative murals showing fallen heroes and historic scenes on the side walls of houses are repainted every few years.“The Republican ones became rather ethereal a few years ago, but now they are showing more guns,” commented a friend. One enormous mural on a wall in the Ardoyne shows a wounded James Connolly, the socialist leader, in the GPO in Dublin during the Easter Rising in 1916. \u0026nbspDerry Girls and MPs stage Northern Ireland abortion protestWhy abortion remains illegal in Northern IrelandMPs urge government to redraft new domestic abuse billElaborate\u0026nbspcommemorative shrines to fallen Republican martyrs, who died fighting the British security forces, are common all over west Belfast, the political heart of the northern nationalist community. But the British Army fortresses in the area have all gone, the places where they once stood used for public housing or community centres. The Falls Road, which\u0026nbspused to be one of the world’s most menacing streets, looks spruce and cheerful with fewer closed shops than most British cities.I had mostly lived close to Queens University during my three years in Belfast, but when I went back the houses along University Road had been demolished, which was no great loss, and replaced with better looking buildings. The pub where I used to drink, the Club Bar, had been replaced, so far as I could see, by a small Tesco store.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCould Belfast and Northern Ireland go back to the three-cornered battle between Protestants, Catholics and the British security forces which I had witnessed?Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement\u0026nbspthat established long-term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of Brexit or because some in its ranks see the GFA as a Labour project that mistakenly diluted British control over Northern Ireland. \u0026nbspThe bits of the GFA that have been abandoned are important.\u0026nbspThe British government is meant to be neutral between unionists and nationalists so as to enable it to play a mediating role between the two communities. David Cameron and later Theresa May have shown their support for the unionists, a bias that became total when Ms May\u0026nbspbecame reliant on the DUP for her parliamentary majority.Similarly, the British and Irish governments were supposed to cooperate if local power sharing arrangements failed, as they have\u0026nbspbut the government has shown increasing hostility to the nationalists in the north and to any role by the Dublin government.The most destabilising factor in Northern Ireland today is the British government itself.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It shows that, surprisingly, the atmosphere is evenly mixed in a way they had not expected.Any explanation for this has to be unorthodox, Stevenson said.It could be that the strange atmosphere is formed by weather events that are concentrating large amounts of ice, liquids and gas across the atmosphere. But it is still not clear.Other instruments on Juno have sent back strange data about its gravitational and magnetic properties. Jupiter seems to have unexplained spots where the magnetic field is either unusually high or low, and it is very different across the northern and southern hemisphere.It\u0027s unlike anything we have seen before, Stevenson said.Scientists also found from gravity data that inside Jupiter – which is at least 90 per cent hydrogen and helium – there are also much heavier elements, which amount to more than 10 times the mass of Earth. But they are not squashed into one core and are instead mixed in with the hydrogen above, which is found in the form of a metallic liquid.And the data also gave new information about the outer parts of both planets. The amount of heavier elements there is uncertain, but the outer layers are playing much more of a role in the magnetic field than the scientists had expected.Researchers now hope to mimic their pressures and temperatures on Earth, in an attempt to understand what is happening on the planets themselves.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bookmaker said the name change would reflect “the increased ersity of our brands and operations”, but chief executive Peter Jackson said: “There are no plans to use this historical name for consumers.” Meanwhile, revenue was up 9 per cent, from £1.75bn to £1.87bn, while pre-tax profit dropped 11 per cent from £247m to £219m. The group said earnings were lower due to investments made in the US, and the idend was unchanged. The firm also said the new £2 stake limit for controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which comes into effect next month, will not have a material impact on its sports-led retail strategy.Created with Sketch.

The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum.

With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in.

This is the biggest fine that we have imposed on a non-party campaigner\u0026nbspfor the submission of an inaccurate spending return to date.Momentum has hit back at the Electoral Commission after being fined almost £16,700 for electoral offences.\u0026nbspIn a lengthy statement, the group criticised the laws it was found to have breached and said the Commission\u0027s focus on small details was comic.\u0026nbspIt said:The Electoral Commission did find some mistakes in our reporting and some clerical errors. This isn’t surprising for a new organisation which at the time was less than two years old and had 25,000 members and 150 local groups. The Conservatives likely employ more lawyers than Momentum have staff, and even getting close to fully complying with these complex regulations for a volunteer led, social movement organisation is a herculean task.\u0026nbspFor example, the law back dates regulations to a year before election day. This means organisations running campaigns in that period can be fined or even prosecuted. In the snap election, this left us in the absurd situation of asking volunteers in local groups to submit receipts for booking community halls and buying refreshments a year before polling day. All for a snap election they did not know was going to take place, in an effort to comply with regulations they did not know they would be subject to. \u0026nbspThe level of detail required under the law was often comic. In one instance, the Electoral Commission queried the purchase of a pizza, wanting to know what percentage of the pizza was eaten by staff members and what percentage by volunteers.\u0026nbspGeoffrey Cox, speaking after returning from Brexit talks in Brussels, has told Sky News:\u0026nbspThese are very sensitive discussions\u0026nbsp- we\u0027re into the meat of the matter now. We put forward some very reasonable proposals and we\u0027re now really into the detail of\u0026nbspthe discussions.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBoth sides have exchanged robust, strong views and we\u0027re now facing the real discussions. Talks will be resuming soon.A no-deal Brexit could trigger a recession in the UK, the OECD has warned.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe organisation said leaving the EU without an agreement would knock 2 per cent off UK growth.The OECD said:In such a scenario, the likely near-term recession in the United Kingdom would generate sizeable negative spillovers on growth in other countries.Although contingency measures to soften the impact of a no-deal outcome are being taken by both sides, UK-EU separation without an agreement would still be a major adverse shock for Europe and possibly elsewhere in the world, given that the United Kingdom is an important trading partner for many countries.NEW: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has said it is possible that Theresa May could order Conservative MPs to vote for a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspAppearing in front of the Commons International Trade Committee, he said he would follow the party line on how to vote if Ms May\u0027s deal is rejected by MPs.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDr Fox said: I will abide by collective responsibility and I am not going to pre-empt discussions we might have in Cabinet about that.Asked whether the Cabinet could decide to back no-deal, he replied: Potentially all things are possible.Theresa May is in her place in the Commons and PMQs will get under way at minute.

Not only that, but we should also be in a customs union with the EU, which is an even closer relationship than Norway’s.\u0026nbspThere is some overlap between their plan and the Labour Party’s policy, which is to keep Britain in a permanent customs union with the EU. So it is significant that Jeremy Corbyn is holding talks with Boles and Letwin.\u0026nbspSome MPs are thinking ahead to Tuesday next week, and asking what will happen if the prime minister’s deal, possibly with a legal codicil attached (on the Irish border question), is voted down again.They wonder if there might be a cross-party majority in the House of Commons for a softer Brexit based on a compromise between Labour policy and the Boles-Letwin plan.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.You can see how the parliamentary arithmetic might work. At the moment, Theresa May cannot get her deal through because neither hard-Brexit Tory MPs nor soft-Brexit Labour MPs will vote for it.\u0026nbspIf she made her plan softer – that is, if she switched to proposing an even closer economic relationship with the EU after we have left – maybe the vast majority of Labour MPs would vote for it. This might more than compensate for the number of Tory MPs she would lose off the other end of the seesaw, and might give her the Commons majority she needs.\u0026nbspOur Labour party can unite behind Corbyn\u0027s challenge to a Tory BrexitThere are obvious drawbacks to this cunning plan, which is why it hasn’t happened so far.One is that May would be left with a rump Tory party. She would probably be able to retain the support of only a minority of her MPs for such a deal – led by Amber Rudd and Philip Hammond in the cabinet and a large cohort of junior ministers, but a rather depleted contingent of backbenchers.\u0026nbspShe would be in a position mirroring that of Ramsay MacDonald, the Labour prime minister who led a government of mostly Conservative MPs after the economic crisis of 1931.\u0026nbspIf the PM’s deal is defeated on Tuesday the Commons would certainly vote the next day against leaving the European Union without a deal, but after that things become less clearAnother problem is Corbyn. Even if the compromise gave him everything he says Labour wants – a permanent customs union, protections for workers’ rights and so on – it would be hard to imagine him whipping his MPs to prop up a Tory prime minister, even one who was implementing a “Labour Brexit”.\u0026nbspAs it is, Theresa May’s Brexit deal is very close to what a Labour government would have negotiated.Indeed, there is no material difference between the withdrawal agreement that Corbyn says he wants and the one she presented to the Commons in January. The government and opposition disagree only about details of the long-term trade relationship with the EU that has to be negotiated after we leave.\u0026nbspA third problem is that Norway-plus is in effect EU membership without voting rights, and it would mean accepting the free movement of people – possibly with a few token restrictions that are claimed to be compatible with EU law.\u0026nbspBut who knows what could happen if the prime minister’s deal is defeated on Tuesday? The Commons would certainly vote the next day against leaving the EU without a deal, but after that things become less clear. MPs might then vote to postpone Brexit – or they might vote against that too.\u0026nbspEither way, it is possible that Norway-plus might be one of the options that comes into play. In which case, the extent of the common ground that Corbyn, Boles and Letwin found today could decide the nation’s future.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Passengers reported that officials were asking more questions than normal at passport control, and security checks on bags were also taking longer than normal.“Customs officers are strictly applying the rules and reinforcing controls,” David-Olivier Caron, an official from the CFDT trade union, said.May could force ministers to vote for no-deal Brexit, Fox saysWorkers are demanding more staff to help them after Brexit, as well as better overnight pay and a danger allowance ahead of the UK’s departure, which on paper is set to happen on 29 March.Philippe Bollengier from the CGT union added: “There will be stronger controls. Today you have a demonstration of what is going to happen.”A spokesperson for Eurostar said: “Eurostar trains departing Paris today are subject to delays of up to 60 minutes.\u0026nbsp“This is due to passport and security checks, carried out by French customs officers, taking longer than usual. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause our passengers.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hindu devotees participate in a traditional activity known locally as Perang Api or fire war one day ahead of Nyepi in Mataram, West Nusa Tenggara.

Only a blank so blank that it screams.”But it was “two-dinners” Watson, before his dramatic weight loss, whose “curry house conspiracy” with Gordon Brown toppled triple election-winner Tony Blair.It was Watson who was forced to apologise after using Parliamentary privilege to smear dead Tory Leon Brittan with “evil” child sex slurs.And it is Watson who aims to wreck free speech by gagging the Press.Jew-baiting Marxist Jeremy Corbyn seems a saint by comparison.His bleak imagery will come as no surprise in Westminster, but it explains the tidal wave of ministers who walked out of her Cabinet in exasperation.To her shame, Amber Rudd and her fellow Ruddites lacked the courage to follow suit last week. Instead, they simply destroyed any last chance of using No Deal as a negotiating card.Ms Rudd once saw herself as a potential Tory leader or a “king maker” to Boris Johnson or Michael Gove.“After last week, any association with Amber would be the kiss of death not just in Westminster, but with the party at large,” said a Tory MP.“She is poison. Everyone wants to leave on March  — other than those who don’t want to leave at all.”That prospect now relies on silver-tongued Geoffrey Cox wangling an escape clause on the Northern Ireland backstop — dubbed “Cox’s codpiece”.The Attorney-General needs to sell his formula not just to Theresa May, but to fellow Leavers — including eagle-eyed veteran eurosceptic Bill Cash, chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee.If they approve, Mrs May might clinch Brexit as promised this month.And then navigate her way to a dignied and honourable Therexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I know, I know. It really could go either way, that one, couldn’t it  You might end up looking as toned as Joe Wicks — or more like Piers Morgan with an industrial air compressor up his rear.Fortunately, ITV and its diet expert Michael Mosley had gathered “six famous guinea pigs” to gorge themselves stupid and settle this debate for good: Nadine, Hayley Tamaddon off Coronation Street, Peter Andre, Made In Cha’s Hugo Taylor, “Chaser” Shaun Wallace and Tessa Sanderson, who all brought their own degree of hype and range of medical quirks to the experiment.Hayley, for instance, has irritable bowel syndrome, while Hugo suffers from a debilitating strain of irritable personality syndrome and is prone to quoting the Dalai Lama or grandly announcing: “I’m trying to do this for other people. It’s kind of, like, a selfless act.” Or it was, until Hugo decided he couldn’t be arsed and pulled out of the experiment at the end of Week One.The other five kept eating, eating, eating, though, until their bodies began to groan, fart and generally give up on their owners. Hayley and Tessa both had to be withdrawn from the process on health grounds, Shaun Wallace developed sleep apnoea and Nadine began passing “rubber pellets”.One other thing also became apparent during the opening few days of The Junk Food Experiment. Their innards could’ve been begging for mercy and Nadine might well have been on the verge of crapping a cc song, but they all looked exactly the same.It was no sort of spectacle at all, so they tried perking it up with all sorts of production stunts. Peter Andre went for a brain scan that revealed it’s  per cent McFlurry, Michael Mosley entered a competitive eating challenge and Shaun Wallace was sent to his local pub quiz, where he misidentied “the unwanted, loud screeching sounds you sometimes hear from a microphone or speaker” as “white noise” rather than the correct answer, Little Mix.On Day , Nadine also went for another dump — and I don’t know what she was thinking while she sat there, but my mind was wandering to the fact it’s now  years since ITV axed World In Action, a show that was sold around the world and conducted the investigation leading to the release of the Birmingham Six.Here we are now, two decades later, watching six self-publicists come to the the “no-s***, Sherlock” conclusion of the century — eating nothing but pizzas and fast food is bad for you.With the most damning fact of all being that ITV, at the very least, is sending mixed messages about the obesity crisis on its network Hub, where I watched The Junk Food Experiment and every other show received the same promo message.“Sponsored by Domino’s — the official food of unmissable entertainment.”Thanks for your concern, though, ITV. It’s overwhelming.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In the northern hemisphere, the spring equinox always falls in what month ”Anne: “December.”Ben Shephard: “The Ace Of Spades was a UK Top Ten hit in  for which hard-rock band ”Ang: “N-Dubz.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What McVitie’s chocolate biscuit is named after a flightless bird ”Andy: “Dodo.”Ben Shephard: “In the  film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which British actor starred as Doctor Frank N Furter ”Tracey: “Sir Anthony Hopkins.”YOU think Theresa May’s got a job on her hands   Spare a thought for the staff on E’s Celebs Go Dating, where they’ve signed up Kerry Katona for the new series. ’Cos that really is the TV equivalent of trying to shove a boulder up Kilimanjaro.Hiring a woman who introduces herself to every potential suitor by announcing: “I’ve got five kids and three ex-husbands, but don’t let that put you off” and describes herself as a “blue-tick shag”, which I thought had wiped out nearly every sheep in West Glamorgan back in .In fairness to Kerry, it does also hint at a level of fame that’s way above the rest of the agency’s clients, who include the thoroughly obnoxious Che Healey, from Hollyoaks, Made In Cha manchild Sam Thompson, Pete Wicks off Towie and someone called David Potts, who could be Mark “The Beast” Labbett’s Chase stunt double, judging by the size of him.None of them, of course, will find anything approaching love on a show where they now boast an impressive  per cent failure rate across six series. What continues to stop it being the most pointless exercise in TV history, though, is the narrator Rob Beckett, who’s fantastically dismissive about everyone and everything involved with Celebs Go Dating.So when David finally reveals “I’m a club rep”, he mutters: “I was thinking either that or a jockey,” and when Kerry reminds yet another person, “I used to be in a girlband,” Rob adds: “Before realising her dream of flogging frozen prawn rings.”In the brutal and relentless process, he’s somehow turned this epic non-event into one of television’s funniest shows, and I just wish the industry could come up with a better reward for him than All Together Now.The Real Marigold On Tour, Paul Nicholas: “There is humour in everything.” See Martin Clunes’ sitcom Warren for proof there really isn’t.BEST news of the TV week is that Channel ’s admirably un-PC The Bachelor has ed to our screens after a seven-year hiatus.Prize this time is a civilian called Alex, who was “bullied at school” , found salvation in the gym and now spends his days running along beaches, like a right dobber.

I mean who, in their imaginations, wants to eliminate the human race It is worth looking at some data. Many of the kids, led by Greta herself, argue that governments are “doing nothing” to reduce carbon emissions.  Not that they are failing to do enough – which is a legitimate argument – but that they are doing nothing.Yet figures published on Monday show an astounding decline in Britain’s CO₂ output. According to statistics released by Carbon Brief,  saw the sixth consecutive fall in the carbon pumped by Britain into the atmosphereTotal emissions are down by  per cent since , a record unmatched by any other major country. With the exception of , the year of the General Strike, you have to go back to  to find a lower level of carbon output.Given the rise in our population in the meantime, that figure is even more impressive. In per capita terms, we have now reduced CO₂ emissions to the level of .You can of course argue that there is still more to do. But “doing nothing”  Seriously  Yet that is indeed the claim being made by eco-activists. They are asserting that governments, including ours, are deliberately wasting time for some reason that no one ever quite explains, but that vaguely has to do with “putting profits before people”.Listen to the way in which the London marchers explained their behaviour in a video put out by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. One after another, the young people claimed that they were protesting against people who were quite happy to wreck Planet Earth.“The government doesn’t really care about our future,” said the first demonstrator. “They’re just trying to waste time,” said the second. “I really care about it, because it’s gonna be my kids who wake up and the world’s in pieces,” said the third. “We’re the ones who have to live here,” said the fourth.And where do you suppose the rest of us will be living  I mean, I get that it is tempting to demonise your opponents, but not wanting their own kids to survive  That’s not exactly setting the bar high, is it To be fair, most of us see the world in black-and-white when we’re in our teens. Think back to what you used to read or watch at that age. Young adult literature doesn’t really go in for shades of grey, does it  J.K Rowling doesn’t try to explain what makes the Malfoys nasty. Their nastiness is a given.Some youngsters extend their Harry Potter view of the world into politics, ing the world, not into Leftists and Rightists, but into goodies and baddies. Why would someone want to poison the seas or burn the rainforests  Because – weren’t you listening  – they’re baddies.Most of us eventually learn that le is more complicated than that. For example, Britain has seen huge reductions in its CO₂ emissions because, under Margaret Thatcher, it stopped subsidising unprofitable coalmines. At that time, the sort of people who now march against climate change were marching against the closures.The reason that the United Statesis also seeing a sharp fall in its carbon output is that it is has taken up large-scale fracking – again, a technology that many of the marchers hate.But rehearsing these arguments means acknowledging that things aren’t always simple. It means understanding that there is a trade-off between opportunities for deprived communities and carbon output. It means grasping that most carbon emissions come from China and India. It means recognising the contradiction between “mining coal good” and “burning coal bad”.Most of the marchers will come to understand these things. But some will carry on telling themselves that people who disagree with them are, like the Malfoys, just evil. A few will never grow out of their teen certainties at all.

If Theresa May were to win such a vote for a second time then there is no ­obligation for the Government to follow mere motions of the Commons.Similarly, ­ministers who cannot support Government policy are entitled to leave the Government, as the honourable recent example of George Eustice shows.Naturally, the Government must prove that it is committed to the referendum result, for that is the authoritative ­constitutional voice.No responsible government ought to allow the constitution to be subverted because of its own weaknesses. The ­conventions are there for good ­reasons and,ignored, confidence in the system that has served well for ­centuries will be damaged — with ­consequences that could include the rise of extremist parties. Failure to deliver Brexit would be a gt to Tommy Robinson.Fortunately, it is in the power of the Government, and especially of Mrs May, to deliver Brexit.  Votes in the House of Commons cannot override the law.If they could we would have arbitrary government and the law says we leave at the end of this month.The Prime Minister could simply refuse to ask for an extension or to move the ­Statutory Instrument that is needed to change the date. Mrs May may choose to fulfil or to break her promises to the electorate and will be held to account accordingly.Eurosceptics must similarly be guided by the electorate — it is our duty and obligation to those who trusted that the vote in  would be decisive and would be implemented.This makes it necessary to vote against the current deal as well as efforts to move the date beyond March .The people have spoken. The case ought to be concluded. Let’s have lt-off.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a project,” he says. Well, yes. That’s the problem. It’s a project to create a European superstate we never consented to.He credits the EU with bringing “peace, prosperity and freedom”. But Nato is responsible for the peace and freedom. And prosperity hasn’t found its way to, say, Greece, or the vast numbers condemned by the euro to unemployment.And it’s hard to swallow anyway from a man whose economy is flat-lining and his cities under siege from enraged, ­yellow-vested anti-EU protesters.Macron admits the EU has problems and speaks of the “European trap”. But, incredibly, it turns out this trap is “NOT being part of the European Union”.

there must be a way of having some recompense.Campaigning MP Frank Field instructed them to look into whether the Consumer Act can apply to the troubled new benefits system, where many hundreds of thousands are set to be worse off.When someone buys a product that turned out to have not been as they were sold, Brits can apply for a refund or complain to a watchdog, it was argued.MP Steve McCabe said today: When you buy something that is not fit for purpose, you can generally get out of it within a certain period of time.Consumer protection is offered to everyone .Charities called for a flagging system to alert those thinking of switching to the new system to check with advisers first, for more training of specialist staff who understand Universal Credit, and a list of all the triggers which can send someone on to the new benefits system without their knowledge..million are expected to naturally migrate over to the new benefits system this year, even though they could be worse off.Moving house, having a child, or changing hours at work can push people to have to apply for Universal Credit.DWP boss Amber Rudd has stopped those with severe disabilities from being moved over automatically, but many others are set to do so.Single parents make up a quarter of those who have gone over naturally, Gingerbreads policy expert said.And charities warned they were all aware of people who were at a higher risk of homelessness when they went onto the new benefits programme.Maeve McGoldrick, Head of Policy and Campaigns at homeless charity Crisis said: If we were going to design the transition onto Universal Credit, one of the fundamental problems is to ensure that we dont cause homelessness as a result of it.Its that drop in income, combined with delays and errors in Universal Credit, and further cuts like Local Housing Allowance, its the cumulative effect of the money they are losing, is putting housing at severe risk.Claimants usually wait five weeks for their first Universal Credit payment, but The Sun wants the Government to reduce this time to two weeks, as we’ve highlighted in our Make Universal Credit Work campaign.She argued that Brits should be able to try Universal Credit out first before they moved over permanently - like Brits who are thinking of moving to a smart meter can do at the moment.The MS Societys Anastasia Berry said they had definitely seen an increase in the number of calls about people worried about homelessness.Ayaz Manji, Senior Policy and Campaigns Officer at mental health charity, Mind, said some disabled people could be losing £ or £ a month due to the changes.That gives people time to prepare and consider whether they would be better off, she said.But the best way of solving the problems with Universal Credit would be to plug the gaps in funding it, she said.If there was more money invested, in housing support and work allowances, half of these problems wouldnt be an issue."},{"url":null,"title":"celebs go dating kerry katona child school attendance","story":"The popstar was today ordered to show a judge attendance records for her child, who cant be named, when she s for trial on May .Katona, , is accused of failing to ensure one of her children attended school regularly between April  to November .The mum-of-five today denied the charge when she appeared at Brighton and Hove Magistrates Court today.Wearing checked trousers, brown flat shoes and a cream fur-trimmed, cape-style coat, Katona beamed as she left court today.Magistrates heard how the Loose Women and Celebs Go Dating TV star, who lives in the East Sussex town of Crowborough, failed to show up at court last month.She had sent an email saying she could not attend on February  because she had a prior celebrity engagement in Scotland.But she was sent a letter from JPs warning she could be tried in her absence and a prison sentence passed.It is the second time Katona has been accused of the same charge after she took her family on holiday to Barbados in  and failed to pay a fine but she insisted it was their dad who had planned the trip.Katona, who has been married three times, is currently looking for a new man on Celebs Go Dating.She first got hitched in  to Westle star Brian McFadden, then five years later married taxi driver Mark Croft.Her last marriage was to George Kay, who she briefly dated at school, in  but they split in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s like a runaway horse.“Don’t watch it go, or let others be the ones to tame it.“The current lot are still in the stable, events have overtaken them and they cannot catch that horse now.”He will add: “We must tame it – our generation. It’s time for a new generation to take over and govern dferently”.Blasting today’s political leaders as “a profession of insincerity”, Mr Mercer will also insist all MPs must be more honest and upfront with voters to win back their trust.Turning on some older Tories, Mr Mercer - tipped as a future Tory leader – will go on: “I love many of my colleagues dearly, but we’ve selected too many of the wrong people over the last twenty years.“We must be courageous enough to hold a mirror up to ourselves”.Speaking at an event organised by the think tank Onward, Mr Mercer will also call for the Tories toto a more compassionate brand of One Nation politics after two years of bitter feuding over Brexit.Showing empathy is the key to reclaiming millions of centre ground voters who currently feel politically homeless, he will argue.The Plymouth Moor View MP will insist Tory MPs must “walk in people’s shoes, govern with compassion as well as fiscal competence, look for common ground, reject the extremes, and ditch the spin”.He will added: “There is a country out there, full of hope, full of optimism, desperately looking for something to vote for.“We are not a hard left country – people don’t want the socialism of Jeremy Corbyn. They want a modern, centre-right values led party.“If we do that, we’ll reach out to plenty of people who feel politically homeless. We’ll connect.

That could then trigger a vote to delay Brexit on Thursday.Yet for all the talk of Mrs May unveiling changes on Monday, the signs from Brussels and London today were bleak.A press conference was killed off after y talks last night between the EUs chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay.  The European Commission said there was still no solution to the Irish backstop, a clause in the -page deal that could trap the UK under EU customs rules from . And today, Downing Street said there had been a robust exchange of views as Mr Cox tried to persuade the EU side to accept legally-binding changes. The Prime Minister has said she wants the changes to the backstop to ensure the UK is not tied to EU rules indefinitely. She was originally requesting either a time limit, exit clause or some other alternative arrangements. However, Mr Barnier told the weekly meeting of the College of Commissioners in Brussels that the negotiations were proving dficult and a way forward had not been found.   The commissions chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters: Michel Barnier was present and informed the commissioners that while the talks take place in a constructive atmosphere, discussions have been dficult. No solution has been identied at this point that is consistent with the Withdrawal Agreement, including the protocol on Ireland Northern Ireland which, as you all know, will not be reopened. Mrs Mays official spokesman told reporters at Westminster: My understanding is that the talks were dficult and there was a robust exchange of views. However, talks are ongoing. The EU continues to say that it wants this to be resolved and that it wants the UK to leave with a deal. Parliament has been clear that for this to happen, we require legally-binding changes which mean that the UK cant be trapped in the backstop indefinitely. That is what we will continue to pursue.   Arriving back in London on Wednesday, Mr Cox told the BBC: This is a moment where we are in the midst of the very heart of discussions. We have made very reasonable, very coherent, very detailed proposals. We are resuming talks soon and we shall have to see where they go. But we are having a good dialogue and a good exchange of views. Askedhe was confident of getting a solution, Mr Cox said: We will have to see. We are certainly constructively engaging at the moment. Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has refused to rule out backing a no-dealBrexit the Withdrawal Agreement is voted down by MPs next week. Dr Fox, who campaigned for Leave in the  referendum, told the Commons International Trade Committee that no-deal was hugely sub-optimal, compared to getting a deal. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves. Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK A backstop could extend EU customs rules UK-wide - and wed need Brussels permission to quit European courts will still have a big hold on the UK.

Asked whether the Government would back no-deal in the vote scheduled for the following daythe agreement fails, he said: Potentially all things are possible. With the scheduled date ofBrexitjust  days away on March , Environment Secretary Michael Gove warned that MPs may be asked to give up their Easter break - due to begin on April  - to deal with the avalanche of legislation which needs to be passed. He told a parliamentary committee: The Chief Whip has reminded Conservative MPs that there may not be an Easter recess. With ToryBrexiteers still refusing to commit to voting for the agreement, ministers have acknowledged they may need the support of opposition MPsthe deal is to get through Parliament on Tuesday.However, the latest attempt to win over wavering Labour MPs with new measures to protect workers rights outside the EU has met with a dismissive response from trade unions.Under the proposals, MPs will be allowed to vote on whether to take new EU workplace rules, rather than them being automatically written into UK law. Trades Union Congress general secretary Frances OGrady said the announcement was blatant window dressing that left protections under threat. Working people need a cast-iron, legal guarantee that rights like these will be safe afterBrexit, and that guarantee should be written into the deal, she said.Jeremy Corbyn is to meet with Conservative MPs backing a Norway-style relationship with the EU afterBrexit, Labour has said.A party spokesman said Mr Corbyn would be seeing former ministers Sir Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles as part of a group of Labour and Tory MPs who support the so-called Common Market . model of a close economic relationship.

The Labour leader held in-depth talks with a cross-party group of MPs who are backing a Norway-plus style Brexit.Afterwards, he said felt “more certain” and “more determined” than ever that a sensible compromise could be struck. Mr Corbyn hopes to secure a close economic relationship with the EU after Brexit that would keep both Leave and Remain voters happy. And he wants to move beyond Brexit to concentrate on crucial domestic issues that are currently being neglected.  But his interest in the Norway Plus proposals will increase Government fears that MPs could force a ‘softer’ deal, including a customs union, in the event they reject Theresa May ’s deal for a second time next week.Writing for the Mirror, Mr Corbyn said: “I left both meetings more certain than ever that we can find a way to work across Parliament to force the Government to back a sensible Brexit plan that protects jobs and more determined to achieve it. “I will continue to reach out to get a decent Brexit deal so our country can spend more time talking about our children’s future than a customs union.”It comes after Tory chief whip Julian Smith warned the cabinet that Parliament could take control of the timetablethe PM is again defeated. MPs are then likely to vote to take a No Deal Brexit off the table and to delay Brexit.Labour sources suggested the party could then, in theory, back a cross-party amendment for a series of ‘indicative’ votes.   This could then pave the way for a vote guaranteeing the future political relationship, including a customs union. A senior Labour source said: “We’re genuinely trying to find a way through which we know involves working wth others in Parliament. “We’re not necessarily going to mind in future whose name is on an amendmentthe outcome is what brings the country together.” The cross-party group - Tories Nick Boles and Oliver Letwin and Labour’s Lucy Powell and Stephen Kinnock- believe their ‘Common Market’ . plan for the UK’s future relationship with the EU could get through Parliament. It almost mirrors Labour’s own call for a close economic relationship with the EU, including a permanent customs union, which was rejected by MPs last month. Both plans would see common external tarfs, follow common rules and mean the UK would negotiate trade deals as part of the EU bloc. The Norway Plus option would see the UK seek a close relationship with the EU, but stop short of full membership. This ‘soft Brexit’ plan, would involve Britain joining the European Economic Areaand the European Free Trade Associationalongside Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It would mean Britain regains sovereignty over food and fisheries, and would mean we are no longer beholden to EU courts. Anda customs agreement can be reached, it would give the most simple solution to the Irish border question - the biggest stumbling block in reaching a deal. It would keep Britain in the single market - which would mean we would still have to accept free movement of people. And we would still have to make a reduced contribution to the EU budget. But as a member of EFTA we would be allowed to impose an emergency brake on immigration should it be shown to be causing social or economic problems.  However, the cross-party group’s Norway Plus plan would only be temporary, until frictionless trade could be resolved by other means. This means that it could potentially get the support of enough Tory MPs to get through Parliament. Manchester Central MP Ms Powell said: “We all left the meeting feeling this was a very genuine and positive endeavour to seek cross-party consensus to break the Brexit deadlock. Tory MP for Grantham Mr Boles added: “If the PM’s deal is defeated next weekParliament will need to find a cross-party compromise. It is very welcome that the Leader of the Opposition is engaging so seriously with the Common Market . plan.” It came as Downing Street admitted that talks between the UK and EU to try to get concessions to win over Tory Brexiteers had been “dficult”, after Attorney General Geoffrey Cox ed from Brussels empty handed.  The House of Lords last night dealt another blow to the PM by demanding that Britain join a customs union on the day it leaves the EU. The amendment, supported by Labour, Lib Dems and crossbench peers, will force the PM to schedule another vote in the Commonsshe wants to maintain her current policy of leaving the customs union when we leave the EU. It is also another sign of Labour moving to put in place arrangements for a softer Brexit deal.

Figures obtained by Which  show that around . million current British passports will not comply with the validity rules. The consumer group noted that Friday will be three weeks before the UK is due to withdraw from the EU, which is the time it takes for passports to arrive after a standard renewal application.   Rory Boland, editor of Which  Travel magazine, said: Millions of people could find their holiday plans disrupted or, worse yet, find themselves stranded at the departure gate and prevented from travelling altogetherthey fail to renew their passport before the cut-off date. Anyone who thinks they might be affected should look to renew their passport today oryou already have travel plans in the near future, consider using the fast-track passport renewal service.

Annmarie Thomas, , died in hospital on September , just days after being confronted about her addiction to painkillers. An inquest into her death revealed that she became isolated after witnessing the death of her grandmother in  and her grandfather in . She started to buy over-the-counter painkillers to sooth stomach pain, an inquest heard.  Mrs Thomas was taken to Princess of Wales Hospital on September  last year after complaining of vomiting and being unable to sleep, Wales Online reports.She was placed on a le-support blood dialysis machine, meaning her unstable condition and pregnancy made her an unsuitable candidate for an emergency liver tranplant. In a statement summarised in court, former husband Gareth Thomas said: [Her grandmothers death] had a massive impact on Annmaries mental and physical health. She became increasingly isolated and started complaining of pain and other ailments. It was at this time that Annmarie started to take over-the-counter medication.   He also said Mrs Thomas found out she had a long-lost brother Ryan Murphy. He said she was getting better after having met him face-to-face in  for the first time. She was finding comfort in it and was making up for time they had missed, Mr Thomas added. The inquest heard Mr Thomas and his we had married in  and ended their -year marriage on good terms. In February , Mrs Thomas formed a relationship with Mr Murphy. During the inquest, Mr Murphy said he found Mrs Thomas, who was -weeks pregnant, unwell after ing to their home in North Cornelly on September . She was rushed to the Princess of Wales Hospital and taken to an obstetrics and gynaecology ward before being put on a le-support machine in intensive care. In a statement read in court Mr Murphy described himself as devastated by his partners death. He said: We had a very loving and happy relationship together. We had massive plans for the future regarding our home le and unborn child. She never failed to tell me how much she loved me. She was even planning to change her last name to be a family together.   Asked about Mrs Thomas addiction to painkillers he said: We didnt meet each other until December []. I didnt know I had Annmarie as a relative until she contacted my mother about six years before that. I didnt know about the addiction. It became more clear when I moved into the house with her. I didnt know about the quantities – it was just something that Annmarie always did. I never questioned how much she took. We did experience one or two confrontations about it – the most recent one was about two or three days before she died. Giving evidence, intensive care doctor Joseph Riddell said he was alerted to Mrs Thomass condition after finding a shocked result from her blood test. Dr Riddell said: Acid levels in the blood are normally .[pH]. Annmaries level of acid was very low which was very dangerous. It was .. When the blood goes below seven its a sign that the blood is very acidic and the patient is unwell. When it drops below seven its a sign that the patient is highly likely to die. She was very agitated and very distressed. She was hyperventilating which is the bodys response to having acidic blood. Dr Ridell said Mrs Thomas went on to suffer two cardiac arrests, both before and after being fitted onto the dialysis machine, but was revived both times. After contacting Kings College Hospital in London, the hospital were told Mrs Thomas was unsuitable for super-urgent liver transplant due to her unstable condition and pregnancy.Dr Riddell said: She received a cocktail of very potent cardiac support drugs. Despite that her circulation continued to deteriorate as her blood pressure continued to drop.She died on maximum le support. Returning a conclusion of non-illicit drug-related death, assistant coroner Nadim Bashir said Mrs Thomas had died as a result of rapid onset liver failure caused by unintentional paracetamol overdose.

Susan and I laughed until our sides hurt at the nickname we had both been given. Id once thought of it as affectionate and sweetly romantic - but now the moniker which tied me to this wonderful woman stood for nothing but lies. Well were good women - and now he has lost both of us, we told one another. We were duped by Anthony. I had made le-changing decisions for this man in the name of a very misplaced love. But, through our pain, loss and deep betrayal, Susan and I found one another.   I met Anthony in , and was smitten from the first dinner date when he took me to a fancy restaurant on the ocean front. He was ft, extremely handsome and, even better - a true gentleman. Id got lucky with this one. He opened every door, paid for every date and after that first dinner, he gently placed his coat over my shoulders as we walked along the sea-front. I was during those heady, wonderful first few weeks and months of our relationship that I fell for him. It was surreal - like something out of a movie. It felt wonderful to feel those butterflies again. He made me feel beautul, showering me with affection. But something didnt feel entirely right from the beginning. He would disappear for weeks at a time without warning, and when I suggested he didnt feel as strongly about me, he told me his feelings actually ran so deep for me, it frightened him. Ive never met a good woman like you before, he would tell me. The periods away continued, but after two years of dating, we grew incredibly close and began talking about our future together. We planned our future in the sunshine, we laughed together, we held hands while eating at restaurants - we were in love.   A year passed by and despite our undeniable chemistry, I still felt something wasnt right and Anthony wasnt fully letting me into his le. I asked him about why I hadnt met any of his children, so he invited his son to join us for dinner - although he was always too busy. Never dreaming this man could go on to hurt me so badly, I went on to honour his request to join his church as a way of proving my commitment. My commitment  It really all seems laughable now. But I did just that, and joined in the hope of one day becoming his we. Though I still had some unease about our relationship, I felt more confident because he asked me to be a part of something I knew was incredibly meaningful to him. Then came the call that would change everything, shattering this so-called love story to pieces. Wed been together for five years, and Anthony had gone into hospital for minor surgery. The operation went well, he told me assuredly in the unexpected phone call. I thought your surgery was scheduled for tomorrow I said, surprised and confused how he hadnt filled me in. Anthony told me doctors had managed to move it forward a day, adding that he was in quarantine for a few more days so it wouldnt be worth visiting. But this was the man I loved, laying in hospital, alone and in pain.   I did what any caring person would and hopped in the car, drove the two hours to his hospital to pay him a surprise visit. And what a surprise it turned out to be - for us all. After checking in and receiving my visitors pass, I took the lt to the sixth floor and I made my way to Anthonys room. A nurse was working on him, so I said hello to him from across the room. Something was obviously not right - Anthony meekly replied hello, but seemed quiet and cold towards me. He had never acted like this around me before and this was not the man I knew. I recognised Anthonys son sat at his bedside from pictures, but couldnt place the woman he was chatting to. She smiled warmly at me and even got up to give me her seat before pulling a spare chair over and sitting down again. We made small talk about the beautul view of Manhattan from Anthonys hospital window. She was easy to talk to and I instantly liked her. We even shared a few laughs before I started the introductions. Im Kathy, by the way. Im Susan, she replied, holding out her hand with a warm smile. In the moments that followed, I had no idea Id grow to love that welcoming, kind smile - a hint at the beautul person she is. Susan - the name rattled around my head. I thought back to a year earlier when Anthony had mentioned his ex-girlfriends name was Susan.   He assured me then that their relationship was long over, telling me I have no idea what happened to her. I didnt want to act too hastily, but instead tried making small talk with Anthony - who by this point refused to engage with me and seemed really tense. I had to get to the bottom of this. “So, how long have you known Anthony  I asked Susan. For eighteen years., she replied frankly. My stomach dropped. I askedwe could talk in the corridor, hearing Anthony mumble, Oh brother, here we go. Here comes the pow-wow, as we left. Alone in the hallway, we told each other everything. I told Susan I had been in a relationship with Anthony for the past five years. I told her how he often discussed our future together and how he had suggested we move somewhere warm like South Carolina. Susans face grew more and more distraught as I continued to tell her about my relationship with him. Then came my turn. Susan took a deep breath before telling me she had been in a committed relationship with Anthony for eighteen years and had even gone shopping for engagement rings before his surgery. I couldnt believe what I was hearing. My le as Id come to know it had ended in this cold hospital hallway.   Then my heart broke all over again - this time, for Susan. Susan asked meAntony ever criticised me, put me down, critiqued my clothes, make-up and body shape. I was stunned, but after promising her Id be % honest, I told Susan that Anthony had made me feel beautul. And he did. He had always treated me with respect and kindness. He was gentle, loving and soft-spoken with me. Susan outlined a very dferent side to him I had never known. I asked Susan, How did we not run into each other at Anthonys home  Didnt you see the bar of Irish Spring soap I left in his shower  She rolled her eyes, I used it, she replied. The more we talked, the more we learned about the two lives Anthony had been living and how he kept us apart. Susan was a good-looking woman who seemed smart and caring, so I asked her why she hadnt left. She didnt respond, but stared blankly at the floor of the hallway. I assured her my relationship with Anthony would end, before walking back into his room to collect my things. I told Anthony everything, but he had nothing to say. He knew it was over.   As I was about to leave, something incredible happened. Anthonys son stopped me, apologised for his fathers behavior and askedhe could hug me. I drove home in a daze, thinking of Susan, wondering why she had stayed with him all these years. She deserved so much better -we both did. I was broken hearted and I felt physically sick for days after that afternoon in the hospital. Discovering Anthony was a player and a liar hit me hard. How could I have been so gullible  Did he think we would never find out what he was doing  My mind was racing with so many questions. Two months after our chance meeting in the hospital, Susan looked up my number and reached out to me. She told me that she had some more questions for me and I answered all of them the best that I could. Susan said she had hoped to marry Anthony one day, but he always had a reason why he wouldnt go through with the wedding - and it was usually a cruel one. Our regular chats on the phone soon turned to topics outside of our ex. We lted each other up and the more we learned about each other, the more we liked.

Cafe Number  is a membership-based, not-for-profit citizens supermarket and cafe. The outlet sells surplus food donated from supermarkets at a discount, with prices at least two-thirds lower than a normal shop. It also serves wholesome, healthy and affordable meals where a family of four can dine for under pound. And after visitors have completed their shopping, they can sit with a coffee and speak to specialist advisors who will help get them back into work, or work with them to consolidate their debt into a manageable payment. The team at the cafe, which is based in Birkenhead, Merseyside, also offer interview techniques, help with improving CVs and even secure them work. “The idea is that we help people help themselves. They stay with us until we sort them out and when they are flourishing, they can move on,” said project coordinator Andrew Forsey.  “We also want to enable people on low incomes to access affordable food in a dignied and welcoming environment. Andrew works with Birkenhead’s independent MP Frank Field, and the cafe is run in partnership with Feeding Birkenhead, a coalition of local community groups. “A driving force is to offer an intervention to people. For someone who is struggling from week to week, it can sometimes just take one event like a broken fridge or unexpected large bill to find yourself in crisis. So shopping with us for a while will help keep them ticking over while we can advise over how best to get a grip of underlying debt problems.” Members are able to take advantage of the scheme for up to six months while they find their feet. “We are working with around  iniduals and their families,” said Andrew. “These are people that were mostly referred by a local housing association but in future we are working with people who come to us from job center.” In the future the centre hopes to help in other areas, like cookery classes. “We have had members tell us, that they buy the food but could do with help with ideas of how to make meals, so that is something we will look to launch soon too.” Staff and volunteers at Number  have also been specically chosen from the community. Those who have been out of work for a while or who need a confidence boost have been employed. Andrew added: “An unexpected boost has been the benefit to people’s mental health, those who have felt isolated and have come here for a shop, a meal, a coffee, have reported feeling uplted.”For more Stories of Local Pride, click here"},{"url":null,"title":"huntsmen clash saboteurs 20 hounds","story":"NewsHuntsmen clash with saboteurs as  hounds chase fox through graveyardExperts say the fox was either pregnant, of had recently given birth, before it was chased down by the pack of dogs in SomersetShareCommentsByAlex ShipmanKelly-Ann Mills:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video horrying-moment--hours-chase-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than  dogs were filmed chasing a fox though a graveyard as huntsmen clashed with saboteurs. The horric footage shows the vixen, believed to be heavily pregnant or to have very recently given birth, running into bushes. She races away across a field before a man on horseback wearing hunting attire sounds a horn from a neighbouring field, in Charlton Horethorne, Somerset. Another hunter on a white horse is then challenged by an animal welfare campaigner as a hound closes in on its prey. The campaigner who filmed the clip tells him: You pull him off! You pull him off that fox right now!   The hunter replies: Im doing it - get out the way. The five-minute video, captured on Saturday, February , was released by animal welfare campaigners Hounds Off and Somerset Wildle Crime. The village of Charlton Horethorne is the home of the Blackmore and Sparkford Vale Hunt which meets at least three times a week. Somerset Wildle Crime tracks the hunts to protect foxes and raise awareness of the practice.   Spokesman Bobbie Armstrong, , said: When the fox crossed in front of us we told a red-coated hunter to call hounds off. At this point, they were right on her and it looked grim. It was all a bit tense for a while. During hunts, we will find vantage points and plot the direction they will travel so we can get ahead of the hounds. We are capturing compelling video evidence to support our case against this cruel and inhumane practice. It was the Blackmore and Sparkford Vale hunt who meet at least three times a week.   People dont realise that hunting still goes on and it happens all through the week. In Somerset, you could witness a hunt every day. Only the presence of so many cameras brings the hunt to their senses and they have to stop the hounds after the second circuit for fear of what the cameras have captured. Penny Little, founder of the Little Foxes charity, reviewed the footage and said: I am confident this fox is a vixen that has recently given birth to cubs as her teats are visible and show clear evidence of lactation.

Ken, , of Tredegar, Gwent, has heard thousands of heartbreaking stories over the past three years as he visited every village and town in the impoverished former pit communities of South Wales, gathering signatures for a petition against the “great pension deception”. And yesterday, he joined colleagues from Yorkshire, the North East, Kent and Nottinghamshire to deliver the ,-name document to Downing Street, demanding back the cash that so many have been “robbed” of. Ken, who worked at Oakdale Colliery, said: “We’ve had tremendous support but it’s been shocking to discover even miners themselves are oblivious to the depths of this betrayal. “Their communities have been destroyed and they’ve been left to scrape by on a pittance while the Government uses their pension billions as a slush fund to dip into at will. “Gathering signatures, I spoke to one widow who gets pound. a week.

The royal couple visited Kirby Road, where the Blackpool Housing Company has bought several dilapidated properties and is transforming them to rent as safe, family homes. But the history of one of the mould-ridden houses in the street proved to be quite unnerving as it was the scene of a murder in . One of the properties on the road the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited used to be known as the Grafton House Hotel, where David Minto, then , lured -year-old Sasha Marsden to her death on the  promise of a job. It was here that he stabbed her  times in an attack described in court as sexually motivated.  Minto, who was jailed for le, dumped Sashas body, wrapped in a bin liner and carpet underlay, in an alleyway near the hotel. Now, that side of the road has been fully renovated while the opposite side remains dilapidated, ready to be targeted in the next phase. The Duke and Duchess first took a tour of a run-down house, asking Lee Burrell from the housing company how they identied the properties in need of urgent renovation. “Are they quite well hidden ” William asked. They then crossed the street, pausing to say hello to four small children, to be welcomed into a new house now lived in by Christina Jackson, .  Miss Jones, who lost pound, of her deposit after she left her old rented property due to large cracks in the wall and peeling paint, said she had felt much more settled since moving to a new home in January. “When did you move in ” the Duchess asked. “Thank you for having us.” The Duke, spotting members of the media, joked: “I hope they all wiped their feet.” Sitting in the living room, Miss Jackson described how she had been left out of pocket and was still catching up with payments while living on benefits for her mental health issues.  “This was a private landlord was it ” asked the Duke, who was told she could not get her money back. “You never had any contact or feedback  No response  No help  “It must have been very frustrating and very depressing for you to deal with that.” The Duchess asked whether the human interaction with her new landlords, where she can speak to office staff on the phone, had been helpful. “It seems really nice here,” said William. “Do you feel more settled ” The Duchess was interested in the decor, wondering: “Can you make changes and choices ”  The couple were particularly keen to hear about the support residents received for mental health issues, with Kate asking: “Do you find it hard to reach out ” Miss Jackson said afterwards: “They said the house is absolutely lovely. They’re so down to earth, they really got it. They seem to know everything that was going on and were very understanding.” Lee Burrell, development director at Blackpool Housing Company, said the couple were “incredibly interested” in the project, and had expressed their concern that people might move back into housing of such poor standard. “They seemed quite shocked,” he said. “There was an element of surprise that properties could be in that position.” Alan Cavill, Director of regeneration at Blackpool Council, said: “I think they were very concerned to know what could be done. “The Duchess was clearly unhappy about the fact that children had been living there - it’s not a place she would want to see any child.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lotto results wednesdays winning national","story":"NewsLotto results: Wednesdays winning National Lottery numbers for £.m jackpotThe results of tonights Lotto and Thunderball draws have been announced - have you won the massive triple rollover ShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsStay tuned for tonights winning numbers \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWinners of tonights National Lottery will scoop a massive pound.m triple rollover jackpot prize.

Consequently, our views and preferences are not reflected in the programme.   We will not be making any further statements or giving interviews regarding this programme. Mr and Mrs McCann have always pledged to never give up the search for their daughter. Scotland Yard launched its own investigation, Operation Grange, into her disappearance in , after a Portuguese inquiry failed to make any headway.  In November last year, a further pound, was granted to the investigation to allow it to continue until March .

To be amongst all of you progressive, motivated,open minded,change-makers, is what gives me hope for the future. Your optimism is inspiring -you see opportunities where other people see challengesyou seek solutions when others just focus on problems. You are the most engaged generation in history.You care about values, doing the right thing,and championing the causes that will shape your future. You don’t judge someone based on how they look,where they’re from, or how they identy. In this room, you see the world for what it is -vibrant, colourful, mixed and full of promise. That is who you are, and that is what makes me feel proud to stand in your presence as you tackle the world’s greatest issues.And you guys know as well as I do, we’ve still got so much to do. As far as I see it, thereare two absolutely crucial issues that we need to focus on,and my hope is that a  more issues will be cured in the process. First, let’s take OUR mental health which you’ve embraced whole heartedly,breaking the generational stigma and helping to normalise the conversation. After all, mental illness is about recovery, mental health is about consciousness,mental fitness is about well-being. To be happy is to be mindful, mindful of your feelings, mindful of your surroundings, and mindful of the . billion other humans that inhabit this planet. And while we’re on the topic of health, let’s talk about the health of our planet too. Climate change, is a humanitarian issue not a political one,and one where we’ve been far too slow in waking up to the issues and acting on the damaging impact our ways of living are having on the world. We now have the facts,the science, the technology and the ability to save not just our planet, but ourselves. I know you don’t sit back and wait for solutions,you take action and create them. Our world’s greatest assets are threatened every day and it is SO important that we support local communities to safeguard every element of this incredible world. Every forest, every river, every ocean, every coastline, everyinsect, everywild animal.Every blade of grass, every ray of sun and every rain drop is crucial to our survival. It is all connected, we are all inter-connected.You in this room understand that and are already making this a safer, healthier and more resilient home for all of us and for generations to come. And for that I applaud you. If we look at the world we’re living in, I know it can feel challenging sometimes,but your role is to shine the light. Every day you are inundated with an overexposure of advertising and mainstream media, social media and endless comparisons,distorting the truth, and trying to manipulate the power of positive thinking.But you don’t let them sway you. Because you don’t need to hide behind your device to share your voice.You confidently voice your opinions because you can embrace them proudly. As my we often reminds me with one of her favourite quotesbyMartin Luther King Jr. -“Darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that.Hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that.” You aren’t always going to agree,you may find yourselves frustrated with the older generation when it seems like they don’t care. But try to remove that judgment. Try to remember that not everyonesees the world the way you do,but that doesn’t mean they don’t care. It means you have the incredible opportunity to help reshape mindsets,to empower those around you to think outside the box, and to work with you, not against you, to find solutions. You know thatyou don’t stand for something you’ll fall for anything. So let that be your true north, let that be your call to action -to inspire those who stand for nothing, to stand for something -and to stand WITH you. So what’s next, what’s on your to-do list starting now... Be braver Be stronger Be kind to each other Be kind to yourselves Have less screen time, and more face to face time Exceed expectations Eliminate plastics Conserve water Protect wildle and their unique habitat Keep empathy alive Ask your friends how they are doing and listen to the answer Be honest Take risks Change your thoughts and change the world Dare to be thegreatest generation of all time I am with you, we are with you!"},{"url":null,"title":"mum spent almost 50 minutes","story":"NewsMum spent almost  minutes on phone before finding baby drowned in bathSarah Elizabeth Morris, from Bagilit in Flintshire left daughter Rosie and her twin brother in the bath unattended while she talked to her partner, jurors heardShareByLydia Morris:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsSarah Morris was on the phone to her partner while her twin children were in the bath unattended, jurors heard \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA one-year-old baby drowned when she was left unattended in a bath while her mum was on the phone, a court heard. Sarah Elizabeth Morris was talking to her partner when daughter Rosie,  months, drowned. Morris, , has been charged with manslaughter and child cruelty, which she denies, North Wales Live reports. Rosie was left in the bath for prolonged periods, Mold Crown Court in Wales was told on the first day of Morris trial. The court heard that the mum - who has been unable to provide a clear account of what happened - was on the phone to her then partner Sarah Swindles for almost  minutes while her children were in the bath. Oliver Saxby, prosecuting, told jurors that Morris, who had been popping her head around the door on occasion, had gone to check on the twins after Ms Swindles advised her to do so.  But when she did, she discovered Rosie had downed. Morris, from Bagilit in Flintshire, Wales, called her friend Jemma Egerton, who she had known for about a month, to tell her that Rosie wasnt breathing and that she didnt know what had happened to her, the court heard. After almost  minutes on the phone, Ms Egerton ended the call by advising Morris to dial . Instead, Morris rushed into the street holding Rosie upside down and shouting for help, leaving her son in the bath. Her neighbour Christine Murphy called for help before taking them both back inside. There were prolonged periods when she was not checking on them and had forgotten about them and the danger they were in, said Mr Saxby.  Neither baby had any child support with them in the bathroom to stabilise or prevent them from falling over. They were left in an extremely vulnerable position. As a result of her failure to supervise the twins as they sat unsupported, one of them drowned. In a police interview following the incident, Morris said that, before she found her daughter, she was in the kitchen doing the washing and heating the towels so they they were warm when they got out of the bath. She told officers that it was after she had been for a cigarette in her bedroom that she thought she heard the plug being pulled in the bath. Morris said she went to look and that was when she found Rosie lying on her back in the bath. She said she performed CPR on her daughter before running out into the street for help. The court heard she told doctors at the hospital where Rosie was taken that she had only left the children for five minutes to get some towels when she found her daughter lying in the bath on her back. The trial continues.

It can revolutionise how a company works in so many areas, from more efficient front line production to improved data analysis. But with technological advances moving at a faster rate than human skills, it is vital for small and medium sized businesses to keep up. So to help, Yorkshire Bank’s Group Business Banking Director, Gavin Opperman, is here to answer your questions... Q How can small businesses reduce costs associated with new technology  A Every small business needs technology to support them to make their business more efficient. Technology is moving faster than human skills are, which is why it is necessary for small businesses to weigh up exactly what piece of technology they want to own, its longevity and whether its development can be outsourced. Q Is understanding the latest technology essential for all small businesses  A Most small businesses will need to adopt some level of technology to make their business run efficiently. However,small businesses get caught up in the technology race too much they can move away from their core business. Remember to find a balance between what is needed and how to make the businessoptimally. Q What technology should small businesses be looking out for  A Every small business is dferent. There’s a number of exhibitions that they can attend to see what technology is most suited to them. Small businesses should look for options that will give them long-term sustainability at an economical rate and ultimately make their business more efficient. Q Many small businesses are struggling with the complexity of new technology – how can they simply the concept  A At Yorkshire Bank, we strive to bring industry experts and like-minded people together. Many of the sectors or businesses are prepared to share their knowledge to others in the industry. It is about finding the right technology to fit your business, and one that is suitable over a long period. Q How can small businesses keep up to date with the latest products and services available  A When it comes to technology, Yorkshire Bank provides a relationship model. We as bankers aren’t there as technology experts, but what we can do is share best practice. We can introduce small businesses to experts in our portfolio who can advise on the latest products and services available. Q Many small businesses are hindered by time and internal resources – how can they still embrace new technology  A The biggest challenge Yorkshire Bank has identied with small businesses is the skills shortage, which puts pressure on internal resources. A lot of universities are developing skills in technology, but it’s how small businesses can retain the talent within that. The aim would be to keep the intellectual property within \u2028the region, so small businesses can embrace new technology without added time or training.Find out more about a business bank that works for you at YBonline business"},{"url":null,"title":"smokers who give up cigarettes","story":"NewsSmokers who give up cigarettes and take up vaping instead save £ per yearA new survey has found the typical smoker has been smoking for  years and smokes  cigarettes a dayShareCommentsByRob Knight:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsA quarter of smokers would NOT try vaping as they believe theyre as bad for you as cigarettes [file image] \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA quarter of smokers would NOT try vaping – with many believing it is just as bad for you as cigarettes, a study found. Researchers found tobacco users are ‘suspicious’ of e-cigarettes and have no desire to give vapes a go - despite health professionals urging them to do so. It also emerged two thirds have attempted to kick the habit at one time or another – four times on average – but to date they haven’t managed to stop for good. Stress, peer pressure and a lack of support were identied as the biggest reasons why they haven’t been successful. Commissioned by Yorkshire Cancer Research, the survey of  smokers and , ex-smokers found the typical smoker has been puffing away for  years and gets through  cigarettes a day.   Chief executive Dr Kathryn Scott said: “Vaping is a great tool to help people quit – and it’s  per cent less harmful than cigarettes. “But everyone is dferent, so the best way to help you give up is to get support from a local stop smoking service. “These services understand people smoke for a whole host of reasons and know it is really hard to stop. “They can help smokers quit using a method which suits them, whether it be vaping, patches or something .” The research also found one in  ex-smokers managed to give cigarettes the heave-ho by taking up vaping instead – saving pound. a year on average.   But  per cent believe quitting by going cold turkey is the best method – despite the NHS saying they’re actually four times more likely to give up for good with support from a stop smoking service. Surprisingly the number one reason those polled want to quit is not health reasons [ per cent] – it’s lack of money [ per cent]. Other motivators include pressure from family or friends [ per cent], becoming a parent or grandparent [ per cent] and the death of a family member or close friend from smoking [ per cent]. Thirty-nine per cent of smokers polled have stuck with the habit because they claim it relaxes them,  per cent carry on because ‘it breaks up the day’ and  per cent continue to puff away because their friends do. Three quarters of everyone polled regret starting to smoke – reasons why include how expensive it is, that it makes your clothes smell and suffering from health conditions. The Yorkshire Cancer Research survey carried out through OnePoll found more than half believe fewer people are smoking because it is not as socially accepted.  And  per cent think the smoking ban has had an impact. Dr Scott added: “There are a whole host of methods for quitting and as the results show, many of those polled think cold turkey is the best way to stop. “However those who use this method might be suffering needlessly - support makes quitting for good so much easier and so much more likely.” "},{"url":null,"title":"twitter thread reveals incredible everyday","story":"NewsTwitter thread reveals strangers incredible random acts of kindnessPeople took to Twitter to tell tales of wonderful acts of kindness that allowed them to see loved ones or just made a bad day betterShareCommentsByElaine McCahillAssistant News Editor:,  MAR NewsSmall kindnesses like holding up an umbrella for someone can make their day [file image] \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIts become a thing on Twitter to ask a random question and see what happens.

The teenager was mute and could not chew so instead held food in her mouth until saliva broke it down. Regardless of where she was she constantly spat, snfing and blowing her nose on anything that happened to be nearby. Genie occasionally touched herself intimately without caring who was near and, despite getting upset and angry, she never cried. The -year-old showed understanding of only her own name and two phrases - stop it and no more. She was abnormally pale, grossly malnourished and the lead her father kept her on had caused a thick, bruised callus to form on her backside.   The case of Genie the feral child became known to the world as one of the most horric examples of child abuse and neglect ever uncovered in the United States. From , she had been imprisoned in the second bedroom of her family home by her dad, Clark Wiley, because he suspected she was mentally disabled. After Genies rescue in , Clark was discovered to be a controlling man who hated noise and did not want children.   His first child died after being left in a cold garage and a second from birth complications. A third, a boy named John, survived, followed five years later by the girl who would become known as Genie. According to researchers, Clark did not speak to her and he instructed her we, Irene, and son John to do the same. From -months-old, Genie had been strapped into a handmade straightjacket and tied to a potty chair in a silent room during the day.   At night, she was locked inside a cot with a wire cover and fed almost entirely on liquids. Clark growled and barked at his daughter like a dog andshe made a noise, he beat her with a stick. Irene, stricken by fear and poor eyesight, finally fled the house of horrors in . Plagued by cataracts, she mistakenly blundered into the wrong welfare office seeking a disability pension and a social worker spotted Genie. She seemed unsteady on her feet, her limbs jerked and she held her hands in front of her body like a rabbit. Clark Wiley was charged over their treatment of his daughter but killed himself on the day of his trial. According tohe left behind a note that read: The world will never understand.The girls story was told in newspapers and TV bulletins around the world, and later sparked an Emmy-winning documentary,Secret of the Wild Child.

According to US military analysts and South Korean intelligence officials, North Korea has started rebuilding the plant it uses to launch satellites into orbit and run tests for its intercontinental ballistic missile program. Satellite images appear to show work being carried out, raising questions about the future of US-North Korea negotiations.

Three-year-old Madeleine went missing on the evening of May ,  from an apartment at the Ocean Club complex in Praia da Luz, Portugal, where she was sleeping with her twin siblings. A new podcast, Maddie, hosted by Australian journalist Mark Saunokonoko, features contributions from former Nottinghamshire officer Peter MacLeod. Madeleines mother Kate McCanns speculation that an abductor could have carried her out of a window as she and her husband Gerry said they believed someone had jemmied open the shutters to get into the bedroom was discussed on the second episode.  Mr MacLeod, who had visited Praia da Luz and inspected Madeleines ground floor bedroom window at the resort, said it was not possible for a man to carry a three-year-old child out the window, Nottinghamshire Live reports.In the second episode of the podcast, released on Sunday March , Mr MacLeod said: The window is only absolute maximum cm wide, in reality about cm wide, and its already a metre off the ground.

Revati Bordawekar, , from Ahmednagar, India, had sensed something was wrong when the thought of using a tampon made her vaginal muscles clench. At the age of , Revati tried to use a tampon for the first time but failed as her hand began to shake and the vaginal opening seized shut. When Revati married Chinmay at the age of , she told her husband of the condition she thought she might have.  She took advice from medical advisers and friends - drinking wine before sex, practising foreplay and even using numbing cream around the labia. But nothing worked and she eventually turned to doctors for help. Revati was put under general anaesthetic for checks and she was later diagnosed with a condition known as vaginismus - when the muscles around the vaginal opening contract involuntarily. The doctors surgically cut her hymen and dilated her in the hopes that she would overcome the condition. However, it had little effect so the couple tried IVF and got pregnant in May last year.   Revati said: We were desperate to overcome it because we wanted to get pregnant, so I looked at the vaginismus support groups for ways to get pregnant. They suggested using syringes to collect semen then inserting it as far as possible into the vagina. We tried an IUI under general anaesthesia because of vaginismus which failed. So we did our first IVF cycle and our second cycle finally worked. Revati had always intended on a C-section delivery due to her vaginismus, but after meeting with midwives and attending birth classes, Revati knew that shed made it this far, so she wanted to experience the full birthing journey.  During the delivery, Revati had to psyche herself up for pushing and despite her vaginismus, she welcomed daughter Eva in February . My daughter was born on February  after  hours of labour. I was at a . cm dilation when I finally had to ask for an epidural because my contractions were getting too intense and I was in great pain. When my midwe said it was time to start pushing, I asked for five minutes to brace myself. I thought about my struggle with vaginismus since my teens, the years of being told to relax and it will happen. I thought of how bad I felt each time I was deprived of something that came naturally to most, yet this was my only chance to experience the miracle of vaginal birth. And then I was ready to start pushing.   Revati said they have not tried sex yet but she is not confident that it wont be a barrier anymore. Ill always remind myself thatI can push a six-pound baby with a head circumference of  cm out my vagina, I can easily take in a penis with much lesser circumference inside of me, she said. I want to show that vaginismus doesnt stop you from giving birth to your baby. Coming from someone like me with severe primary vaginismus -I could do it, you can too.

He got the wire out of his finger last week.“He can start his comeback proper and he’s keeping Andrew Davies company at the moment – they’ve done a lot together on the bikes and they’re doing running on the training ground so it’s great to see them coming back.”Meanwhile, two bodies he’d like back sooner are nearing aand Jim is hoping he’ll have his striking options boosted for Saturday’s home clash with Hearts.Frontmen Andrew Nelson and Craig Curran missed the - defeat to Rangers last midweek but have a chance of athis week.“They are coming on, slow,” Jim said.“They aren’t back on the training ground yet but we’re hoping we’ll have at least one back training by the end of the week.“Craig had an injection in his stomach last week which has settled down nicely but it needs time.“Nelson is his heel which he picked up celebrating his goal at Livingston.“Again that is better but it’s not fully away yet.“What we don’t want to do is bring him back too early and there is a recurrence.“We’ve tried a couple of dferent things but he was tender last week and we had to back off.“It was better over the weekend so we’ll see what he’s like by the end of the week.”At Ibrox, Jim opted for on-loan forward Scott Wright to lead the line in an attempt to catch Steven Gerrard’s Rangers on the hop with pace and will have that option again. However, he’d welcome goalscorer Nelson and “focal point” Curran back.The Dens gaffer said: “Craig has been a focal point for us and brings a lot of people into play in terms of the work he puts in and how he doesn’t let defenders settle.“We went for pace against Rangers by putting Scott Wright up and pace on the sides with Jesse Curran and Andy Dales.“That wasn’t an easy decision because we had Kenny Miller’s experience there as well but we felt we could get down the sides of them when their full-backs went forward but we met them on a night when they were excellent.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/pressandjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/magellan_cruise_-1-e1546007762270-940x521.jpg ","title":"buy one get one free set sail with the tele on a luxury cruise to norway and the scottish isles departing from dundee","story":"Tele readers will be able to enjoy the best sights Norway and Scotland have to offer when the paper sets sail on its very own cruise adventure.The exclusive Tele voyage on the majestic Magellan cruise ship  will depart on a nine-night tour around some of the most breath-taking scenery in the world.With up to , passengers, the glamorous ship will visit awe-inspiring fjords and some of Scotland’s stunning islands.A convenient departure from the Port of Dundee means you can look forward to leaving the hassles of airports behind and get straight into holiday mode.The journey evokes nostalgic memories of the days when The Tele#s parent company ran a famous shipping line in the s.There will be plenty of entertainment on board as well during the special trip # all organised by The Tele#s owners DC Thomson and ship operator Cruise and Maritime Voyages.Fresh delights will await every day as a dedicated team of expert chefs and attentive restaurant staff serve up delicious meals and a luxurious evening dining experience with up to five courses.Magellan, named after the great explorer Ferdinand Magellan, offers an incredible iety of activities within its ftframe, including a show lounge, pubs, coffee shops, casino and shopping galleria.The Tele Magellan voyage departs from Dundee on June  , and arrives back in Greenock  days later # after taking in sights including Flam, Bergen and Portree.While best known these days for its industry-leading publishing work, DC Thomson has a long and proud association with the sea.Following his success in business, William Thomson II looked to the seas and purchased a stake in a sailing ship.His involvement escalated over the years when he purchased more vessels.Eventually, with a fleet of , the Thomson family was responsible for one of the most invaluable shipping firms in the world and provided essential aid to South Africa during the Boer War.Andrew Thomson, chairman of DC Thomson, said: “It’s wonderful to see DC Thomson realigning with its heritage by ing to the seas.“When William Thomson established the Thomson Shipping Line in the th century I’m sure he didn’t contemplate that over  years later DC Thomson would be transporting passengers by ship around the Scottish Isles and Norway.“This kind of ersication of the business is a great fit for DC Thomson.”Craig Houston, head of enterprise for DC Thomson Media, said: “Working with Cruise  Maritime Voyages to bring this highly desirable sailing route to DC Thomson Travel customers has been a pleasure.“We’re excited to be offering such a special route with a trusted partner and we can’t wait to hear what our passengers say about this amazing trip.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee skipper martin woods says side need to keep their heads to avoid relegation","story":"Martin Woods says Dundee need to keep their heads in the “crazy” Premiership run-in as they attempt to battle their way to safety.The Dark Blues dropped back into the relegation play-off place after a -

but it’s a crazy league.“Weeks ago, nobody would have seen us going to Tynecastle and getting a result so there will be ups and downs and we have to stick together.“We’ve looked through the Rangers game and seen what we can do better defensively as a team and take that on to the next bunch of games to get some points on the board.”With no match over the weekend due to the Scottish Cup taking priority, it’s been a welcome break for the Dark Blues after a couple punishing results.Woods hopes the breather will allow them to up their game when Hearts come calling on Saturday.“I think it’s been a tough run of games so it’s been good to sit back, reflect and get ready to go again,” he added.“We’ll work on a few things in the training ground and take it into the next bunch of games which are going to be vital.“We have a couple of tough ones coming up with Hearts at home, which we hope to get something out of, and then Celtic at home will be a day we have to be disciplined and get off to a lot better start than we did at Rangers.”If they keep their discipline and manage to up their level from the first half at Ibrox, Woods is confident their luck will turn to help them make it two wins in a row against Hearts, after their - victory at Tynecastle in January.He added: “Against Livingston, they went down to  men, we got a goal in the last seven minutes, we could’ve had a penalty against us so we’ll get days where things go for you.“That’s probably two in a row where nothing’s gone for us at all against Hibs and Rangers.“There will be loads of twists and turns before now and the end of the season, we just need to focus on our performance levels and try to keep that high.“We dropped in the first half against Rangers which wasn’t great but that was a mixture of both them being really good and us not doing as well as we could.“The first goal from a set-piece, we weren’t tight enough and got punished.“From there you could see them get a lt and that’s an important thing to do at Ibrox, to start well.“It was very frustrating but we’ll not be judged by games like away at Ibrox, there will be a lot of big games to come before now and the end of the season.”Woods is also keen to repay the club’s support that has been starved of home success this season with the number of home wins the worst in the ision.“The fans have stuck with us and they were brilliant against Hibs.“I think they can see the performance level has been better in recent weeks.”"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee player gerry remembered fondly by some of his school pupils","story":"The photo of former Dundee FC player and coach Gerry Follon was featured on October .This showed Gerry with a group of pupils from St John’s, where he was a teacher, a profession he pursued after giving up playing football.Rob Boag sent in the original tale and put the date of the photo as ‘circa ’.However, one reader was more precise with the date – because he was in the photo.Kirkton reader Andy O’Neill offered: “This photo is of first-year pupils at St John’s in -.“Gerry was a good teacher and a nice man.“He was our register teacher and was always nice to the lads, but could be strict when he had to.“I’m pictured in the second back row, second from right.“Also in the photo, the lad in the centre of the front row is Billy Briggs, brother of Dundee United legend Jimmy Briggs.“Another pupil in the back row, second from left, is John Waddell.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Shoppers stopped in their tracks and shopkeepers stood on their doorsteps to honour an Ayrshire soldier. Police sealed off the High Street to cars as the cortege arrived at the Kirk Port entrance to the Auld Kirk. The silence was broken only by the lament of a lone piper as Jock’s family filed their way into church. Jock’s coffin was carried into a packed service by men of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. His coffin was draped in a union flag and on top were his cap, belt, his campaign medals and a wreath. A dozen colleagues in the firing party formed a guard of honour after the coffin had passed under the  lych gate. Jock, , lived in Dundonald with second we Gigliola, better known as Julie. And he ran a log and firewood business, as well as being a yeomanry reservist. He was laid to rest with full military honours at Drongan where he spent his boyhood and where parents Dan and Rita live. The father-of-two died six days after his armoured car overturned at the Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire on January . Among the mourners in the Auld Kirk was Colonel John Dalrymple Hamilton, who was representing Prince Charles. Provost Helen Moonie of South Ayrshire Council also attended the service. And there was military top brass from both regiments in which Jock served –the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. Other regiments represented included the Royal Engineers, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and the Le Guards. Members of the Army Cadet Force were also present to pay their respects. Jock was  years in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, rising to be a Challenger tank commander. He survived tours of duty in Iraq, Kuwait and Kosovo, only to die in a training exercise. Auld Kirk minister Rev David Gemmell described how John McKelvie ‘grabbed le by the throat’ from his earliest days. He wasn’t much of a scholar at Drongan Primary and Auchinleck Academy, but he knew every creature that ran, crawled, swam or flew in the countryside. And a love of the great outdoors was a huge part of his le – whether it was fishing, playing rugby, ski-ing or mountain biking.  He and we Julie were fond of dogs, and Julie taught her big action man how to ride a horse, said the minister. Major Richard Boyle of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards read the lesson - ‘To every thing there is a season’ from Ecclesiastes. There were hilarious army anecdotes from best buddy JR Ewing, telling how they had shot at each other - with paintballs. J R also mentioned how when Jock was rebuked by a French officer in Kosovo, the big man pointed to his Royal Scots Dragoon Guards cap badge – a French eagle with the word Waterloo underneath. J R, his voice breaking, concluded by saying: “He was the best soldier I ever served with and my best friend.” Former RSDG officer Will Galbraith highlighted Jock’s pride in his regiment, his family and his friends. He said: “He had a strong sense of honour, of right and wrong, and would always stand up for the underdog.” Will said: “He was a big man, with a big voice and a big heart – a big character. But when you really got to know him, he was a big softie – although you wouldn’t tell him that. You had to be aware of those big hands.” Army chaplain Rev Duncan Macpherson said there were bound to be feelings of frustration, anger and regret at the way John McKelvie died. He hoped these would be resolved, adding: “He was someone who was thoroughly tested, who rose to the challenge and who was a thoroughly professional soldier. He was passionate about vehicles and made sure his was ready for any task.” Lt Colonel Toby Gaddum, commanding officer of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry, led the congregation in the regimental prayer. Rev David Gemmell brought the church service to an end by poignantly reciting “We Let You Go’. The poem ends: “We love you, we miss you, we want you to be happy. Go safely, go dancing, go running home.” A collection at the end of the service raised vital cash for the Ayrshire Yeomanry Families Fund. Jock was laid to rest at Drongan Cemetery, where a guard of honour fired three volleys from their rles.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrince CharlesRoyal Scots Dragoon GuardsSouth Ayrshire CouncilMiddle EastArmed forcesRoyal FamilyLove and romanceDundonaldAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr boxing king calvin mccord","story":"NewsAyr boxing king Calvin McCord crowned Scottish Lightweight Champion after thrilling bout at Trump TurnberryThe Ayr star won his first Scottish title in an exciting bout before a sell-out crowd in the Donald J Trump ballroom.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR NewsCalvin McCord celebrates with his title\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRing king Calvin McCord told how he got off the canvas twice to land his first Scottish title.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"college staging wine fuelled feast","story":"NewsCollege staging wine-fuelled feast as job cuts loomLeaked emails tell of lavish bash at cash-strapped Ayrshire CollegeShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCollege bosses have defended holding a celebration to honour their success amid a climate of drastic job cuts and cash problems. Ayrshire College supremos and invited senior staff will stage a sit-down feast later this month to mark five years since its formation. The dinner for  will also include free wine after a sponsored deal by college chairman Willie Mackie. Leaked emails state the claim the college is “now regarded as one of the most successful colleges in Scotland.” But our inside source said: “It adds insult to injury that this celebration is being held less than one week before the final jobs structure is issued to staff. “It is in extremely poor taste given the circumstances of potential job losses due to lack of funds.” Evening classes are having to be cancelled so the event can be staged at the Kilmarnock campus on March . Retiring principal Heather Dunk is also to be honoured during the evening. Chairman Willie Mackie said: “She has made a signicant contribution to Ayrshire for over  years.” Ms Dunk retired on February , leaving an impending restructure which will cost jobs. A consultation ends tomorrowand it has emerged the Private Finance Initiative which built the Kilwinning campus is a huge drain on funds. An email which Ms Dunk sent to staff in January read: “We need to make signicant savings to be financially sustainable due to the costs associated with the PFI, unfunded national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and other services. I am very disappointed that an organisational review is necessary, it is not what I want to be focused on in my last weeks as principal. “However, we must manage within the financial allocation we receive in this very dficult fiscal climate.” Under the consultation, one of the four vice-principals would be axed, three directors culled, heads of learning cut from  to nine, and three marketing coms staff would go. Also at risk of the chop are two posts within estates as well as a shake-up of duties among departments. The board of management will approve the final structure and staff impacted will get a severance package. Ayrshire College acknowledged finance was a major challenge for all Scottish colleges but said the dinner costs were met by sponsorship. A spokeswoman said: “Our main financial challenge for the year ahead is to meet the costs associated with the Kilwinning PFI Campus, national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and services. “While the Scottish Funding Council has agreed to provide further strategic funds to help manage these rising costs, the college still requires to make signicant savings to secure its financial sustainability and jobs for the future. “We are, therefore, considering proposals for an organisational review. “All staff are aware of the challenges the college faces, and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation. “We have just passed our five-year anniversary as Ayrshire College, and have planned an event, ‘Celebrating Five Years of Success. It is important to recognise this milestone and celebrate success – for learners, staff, the college and the region. “We are mindful of the costs of holding such an event and so have secured full sponsorship.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnUniversities and CollegesAyr NewsAyrEducationKilmarnockSchoolsKilwinning"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"drongan man 28 snared having","story":"NewsDrongan man, , snared for having sexual relations with -year-old girlSick Samuel Davidson, of Watson Terrace in Drongan, was caught out when officers found the teen in his bedroom on May , .ShareByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsDavidson admitted engaging in sexual activity with the girl\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA -year-old man was snared for having sexual relations with a -year-old girl after her parents filed a missing persons report.

The Royal National Leboat InstitutionAyr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat. The branch, which has been around for over  years, issued an urgent appeal last November, appealing for a younger generation to pitch in to save the Ayr branch . Committee member and Secretary Robin White, said: “Sadly the number of volunteers helping to run the branch recently has been dwindling, to such an extent that so few are left the AGM came to the sad decision to close the branch down. However, a number of branch members have indicated they still wish to support the RNLI and will now do so via the Troon Branch. “This Branch is looking for new volunteers, soyou would like to help, please get in touch.” Ayr once had its own Leboat, stationed at Ayr Harbour in  under the management of Ayr Harbour Trust.   During the following  years a number of dferent Leboats were in service, one of which was built in Shadwell, London in  for just under pound. This was transported from London to Ayr Station by rail free of charge, by the London and North Western Railway Company. It was taken down Ayr High Street to Ayr Harbour and christened the ‘Janet Hoyle’, after the donor’s we. Eventually in  the RNLI Committee of Management decided to close the station as Troon had a motor Leboat where there was deemed a safer harbour entrance. There was then no RNLI presence in the town until the late ’s when a group of people decided to start a Fundraising Branch. This has been in existence ever since and has raised well over pound, in its time.

She said: “Hourstons battled against the changing retail environment but this is a story being told on the High Streets of many of our town and city centres as a lot of traditional retailers close because of major consumer changes.

Ally Bally Bee - with a trail of children in his wake.Coltart also lived at houses in Henderson Close and Park Street, which have both since been demolished.And he was known to travel to nearby Melrose and Selkirk, as well as other Borders towns, to sell his candy on the streets.An appeal in January for further information on Robert Coltart saw Angela receive messages from across Scotland and even Canada, which helped with the final design.Historian Mary added: ldquoRobert Coltartrsquos story is one that many more people should know about and I hope this sculpture will encourage people to find out how the famous song Coulterrsquos Candy came to be written by a weaver from Galashiels.The finished tribute in the Market Square will become part of a new town trail, supported by the Scottish Government.Around pound, of improvements are planned as part of the regeneration of the town centre.Helen Calder of Energise Galashiels Trust, who has also championed Coltartrsquos story, said: ldquoWe want Galashiels to be a more vibrant, welcoming and confident community.\"The tale of Robert Coltart embodies this vision, and we are delighted progress is now being made to finally celebrate his link to our town.The funding from the Scottish Government is also supporting new visitor signage and improvements to Channel Street and Douglas Bridge, as well as helping to fund the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction.The town trail will include the location of Robert Coltartrsquos one bedroom flat in Overhaugh Street, which he shared with his family.Councillor Mark Rowley, who is the spokesman for business, said: ldquoIn line with other regeneration works going on in Galashiels, the Coulterrsquos Candy project has been taken forward with a number of partners and it was important they all had sight of the initial design before it was issued publicly.ldquoA real effort is being made to ensure visitors are attracted to Galashiels, and the wider Borders area, and it is worth noting that without the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction -

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 1 2019","story":"Ellen Sager, , from Tumbler Ridge, sent a letter to the Courier in August , asking for information about her Campbeltown-born grandfather, Thomas Douglas.Ellen said she knew very little except what her mother, Isabella, who emigrated to Canada in , had written in her grandmother Bessie’s obituary.It read that -year-old Bessie was the widow of Thomas Douglas, a lighthouse keeper who drowned at McArthur#s Head Lighthouse, Islay, in November , just nine months after Isabella was born.Ellen received two replies to her  request, from relatives who gave her the name and address of Robert Douglas, Thomas#s nephew, who was born in Campbeltown in  but moved to Australia in .Ellen said: #When I contacted Robert, he said he did not know that his uncle Thomas had a family.#I have been blessed to have many letters that Robert has written describing le in Campbeltown.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

People pick up dferent ideas from other peoplersquos weddings and events in other parts of the world and then they want that for themselves. Itrsquos an aspiration thing and the Internet has a lot to play, making people more educated, savvy and know what they want. Because of this, people think out the box and are able to put their own personal touch on the wedding to make it unique.Thinking outside the box is definitely what Hassanrsquos clients do well. The biggest wedding he has planned in his career involved a dizzying , guests. With clients more cost-savvy now, he describes how over-the-top ideas from couples are never far.ldquoThe craziest idea wersquove had was when a couple wanted , flowers hung from the ceiling two years ago, Hassan remembers, amused. ldquoIn big spaces like conference rooms, it softens the space, but these things are expensive - particularly with fresh flowers - so we then have to look at the next best thing, how we can achieve it, how it can be set up. We would then have to work with other professionals who can work at heights.In the first episode, we get to see a wedding being put together in the cityrsquos Crowne Plaza as Hassan and his staff scramble to hang hundreds of flowers from the ceiling, albeit fake ones.He explains: ldquoFresh flowers are obscene and not everyone can afford it, so we then look at articial flowers, which look just as real. For the sake of a few hours, they want it to look good, obviously.What is it about weddings that have Asian families going over-the top ldquoPakistanis are not that extravagant in their day-to-day lives, but a wedding is when theyrsquoll either be welcoming a new addition to the family or giving their daughter away, so theyrsquoll spend the most, says Hassan.ldquoWith pound, budgets, you have to take everything into consideration, including clothes and jewellery, which are a big expense. Clients travel to Pakistan and India to get their shopping done. Remember, Asian weddings can last for days as well. Some families will put marquees up at home and host pre-wedding events where the whole family comes together. It does add up to quite a lot of money, but the Bank of Mum and Dad can help out. Though, these days, professional couples themselves are very much in control and can pay everything themselves. Many live with their parents so they have that additional income saved up, he adds.Viewers will get to see a Falkirk mum planning a joint walima for her two sons in episode one as Hassanrsquos clients work on ways to cut down costs.Hassan says: ldquoSome will realise itrsquos too extravagant and theyrsquoll decide to put money into a house instead. But, nowadays, clients will cut down on the number of events they have and just roll it all into one day to cut down on costs.Working with demanding clients and large families comes with its tribulations. Hassan says: ldquoWhen yoursquore working with two families trying to create one event, sometimes it gels really well and other times itrsquos the opposite and you get friction. Usually, one family will sit back and let the other take control. If both families have dferent views, they can clash. Irsquove had that before and it does get tricky. Wersquove witnessed barnies happening right in front of us and it can get awkward, but itrsquos just about stepping in and mediating. In the end, theyrsquore always smiling.Itrsquos been his busiest year on record and, as Asian weddings continue to evolve, whatrsquos next for Hassan and his team ldquoWersquore seeing people sht away from having weddings in Scotland and opting for destination weddings. Several clients have gone out to Turkey, Dubai, South of France and Italy. Thatrsquos a new, up-and-coming trend, to take all the guests out on a holiday and have all your events out there.

Tell you that therersquos going to be a referendum on Brexit, that the ERG are back in their box, Jezza has finally come good, and Theresa May has been put in a secure unit. But I canrsquot in all honesty agree with commentators, like the blessed Polly Toynbee, who believe we are now on the road to redemption.Yes, Labour did repeat its promise to hold a referendumJeremy Corbynrsquos ldquoworkable plan of a permanent customs union is rejected ndash as it was in one of last weekrsquos many meaningless votes. Oh, and Labour will support a referendumthere is no General Election. Anda no deal Tory deal looks likely. If, , .ButLabour really wanted to eliminate the threat of no deal, it would have moved heaven and earth to deliver the SNPrsquos motion calling for precisely that.Looking back on this dismal week, the standout, surely, is the arrant insanity of Parliament ndash a rational body of elected representatives ndash failing to take the opportunity to rule out an event which would put the army on the streets, interrupt food and medicine supplies, and cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.Yes, the Yvette Cooper Oliver Letwin amendmentwas endorsed by Parliament overwhelmingly, after Theresa May gave it the nod. This means that there will be an extension to Article Parliament doesnrsquot support a deal by March . Well and good. If therersquos one thing the UK Parliament is supremely good at itrsquos failing to agree.It doesnrsquot like Mayrsquos botched deal, the Norway option, EFTA or any other solution that Brussels thinks acceptable. So that means an extension is inevitable. Except that the French president Emmanuel Macron and the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, have made clear that the  countries of the EU , will only contemplate delaying Britainrsquos departure from the EUit is for ldquoa purpose. Holding more meaningless votes, staging more ministerial resignations and arguing on College Green outside Parliament do not, one suspects, constitute a legitimate purpose.Still, everyone seems convinced that an extension is in the bag. This led to largely unwarranted excitement on the Remain side. With Labour calling for a Peoplersquos Voteand Theresa Mayrsquos deadline finally breached, Twitter went into orbit. Lord Adonis all but declared victory in the Battle of Brexit. Europhiles were dancing in the streets, metaphorically at least, and jeering at the nasty Brexiters who had been defeated by the forces of good. It was like the last reel of Lord of the Rings.But such triumphalism was premature. Much as I wish it were the case, there is still no majority in Parliament for a referendum. Stephen K Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, has been counting them out and counting them back in again and he is adamant that the Labour Brexit rebels will prevent any motion for a referendum passing through Parliament. He says at least  Labour MPs are opposed. Hersquos right.ldquoRebels here is something of a misnomer since there is widespread belief that Brexit is the outcome desired by their leader. Indeed, on one interpretation of last weekrsquos events, Jeremy Corbyn has managed to find a way to secure Brexit while also appearing to support a referendum. This is because what is called the Kyle Wilson amendment.This cross-party proposal, which Labour is minded to support on March , calls for MPs to agree to Theresa Mayrsquos deal , but only on the condition that there is a referendum to validate it. Bingo. Labour can tell all its working-class Brexit supporters in target marginals that, yes, it didnrsquot block Brexit. But Jeremy can also curry favour with the Remainiacs of Islington by appearing to support a Peoplersquos Vote.Itrsquos very clever, but to my mind somewhat bonkers. Why would Labour help pass Theresa Mayrsquos deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has said is worse than no deal, would lose thousands of jobs and would lock the UK into a backstop from which it cannot escape  At least this is what he has said repeatedly in the Commons.Surely, a vote is a vote. Theresa May could legitimately say that her deal has been endorsed by Parliament, and call on Labour to campaign for it in any referendum. Not that she has the slightest intention of calling a referendum.Theresa Mayrsquos strategy is the same as it ever was: not listening, nothing has changed, take it or leave it. It pains me to say it, but the Prime Minister at least has a strategy. It is to run down the clock, while allowing the ious tribes in Parliament and in her Cabinet, to fall out among themselves.Itrsquos working. Labour is moving ever more in the direction of her deal, however much they may deny it. Parliament canrsquot agree on anything.There are tears in Cabinet and more resignations ndash  from the Government so far. But whorsquos counting  The European Research Group ndash that comically misnamed faction of extreme Brexiters ndash has reportedly split over William Rees-Moggrsquos equivocation on the Irish backstop.And while all about is chaos and acrimony, so ticks away the clock until Brexit day. Twenty-eight days at the time of writing. Goodness me, is that really the time  Yes it is. As in the film of the same name, the zombies are stirring.I accept that is an offensive way to describe Nigel Faragersquos ldquoBrexit Betrayal march from Sunderland to London. But it could get nasty on the road.What do I think will happen in the end  As Irsquove been saying in this column since Christmas, I think Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. There will be an extension of Article , and Labour will probably end up backing Mayrsquos deal, or abstaining on it which amounts to the same thing.If Labour, by some remote chance, continues to reject Mayrsquos deal or its iants, in the meaningful vote on the inglorious twelfth, then I think MPs would still reject a referendum. There is still no majority for one, and Labourrsquos die-hard Brexiters are not for turning.Which makes the most likely option ndash about the only one Theresa May can authorise as PM under her prerogative powers ndash would be to revoke Article . Pull the plug. End it.OK, so thatrsquos wishful thinking on my part. Her Government would fall and precipitate an election. But looking at the chaos that is Brexit, and the lack of time, it seems as good a shout as any, especiallyBrussels reject a meaningless extension.If Britain canrsquot decide how to leave the EU, an extension to Article  would be pointless. The sensible thing to do would be to cancel Brexit, go away, and think again."},{"url":null,"title":"sister-does-it-for-herself","story":"Heralded as one of the most powerful forces in the cinematic universe, the character also arrives in the wake of Black Pantherrsquos boundary pushing success and with her own agenda to fulfil in terms of striking a blow for feminism. Yet while hugely entertaining for long periods, her debut outing also struggles at times to juggle every one of its lofty ambitions, particularly given that it also has to contend with being an origins story.Co-writers and directors Anna Boden and Ryan Flecktry their best to keep things fresh and provocative by mixing tones, blending styles and avoiding the temptation to resort to anything episodic.But they sometimes struggle with the filmrsquos emotional range, being thwarted by the need for the type of fan-pleasing spectacle that, by necessity, pushes some of their more character-driven inclinations to the wayside.They overcome the origins constraints by playing with the timelines, opening the film with a mystery that Captain Marvel must solve concerning her identity. How did she become so powerful when her fractured memories also paint her as a fallen fighter pilot and a plucky child racer  In struggling to understand herself, however, Marvel ndash aka Carol Danversndash also finds herself involved in a war between two alien civilizations, the Krees and the Skrulls, which eventually brings her to Earth in  and into an unlikely alliance with SHIELDrsquos Nick Fury .The ensuing adventure establishes Danvers as a kick-ass heroine who likes to have fun, as well as one of lersquos battlers. And itrsquos here that Boden and Fleck lay down the filmrsquos feminist agenda, pitting Danvers against stereotypes without feeling too heavy-handed in doing so.Larson gives Danvers plenty of range and is hugely likeable, whether bantering with Jacksonrsquos younger, less uptight Fury, or reuniting with her former best friendndash scenes which deliver most of the filmrsquos emotional heft. But while these elements excite, the central conflict driving the narrative ndash which alludes to real world issues such as refugee crises - does eventually settle into a more familiar Marvel routine and causes the film to stumble when it should soar.Yet while lacking the social impact of Black Panther or the leftfield delight of s of the Galaxy or Thor: Ragnarok, Captain Marvel still does enough to emerge as another winning entry into Marvelrsquos continually impressive universe."},{"url":null,"title":"thatcher-would-have-loved-it-review-approaching-empty-tron-glasgow-four-stars","story":"Approaching EmptyTron Theatre, GlasgowNeil CooperFour starsTaxis arenrsquot the only thing for hire in Ishy Dinrsquos new play, which pitches its stall in the sort of dingy cab office all but wiped out by big business these days.

The discolouration has been blamed on carcinogenic Hexavalent Chromium , the toxic compound featured in the film Erin Brockovich.More than  hectares of land in the area is classed as contaminated as a result of the actions of chemical company JJ Whites, which operated in Rutherglen from  to  and which at one time produced more than  per cent of the UKrsquos chromate products.As well as dumping waste from its processes in disused underground mine workings, slag contaminated with chromium was used as the foundations of buildings and even deposited in open air sites such as football grounds.While partial remediation work has taken place in some areas, the pollution in the burn in a popular park, where children play, has highlighted the fact that contamination from underground dumps is still leaking into the environment.Mr Sutton said home owners could end up footing the bill for any problems caused by the pollution in the vicinity of Oatlands, and where. \"Householders on new estates need to urgently checkthe planning application for their estate had an EIA,\" he said. \"With housebuilders guarantees effectively ending after two years, it will be the poor house purchasers who are left to deal with the long term problems.\"Volume house builders are reaping major idends, particularly in the context of Government help-to-buy policies, he added. \"Unfortunately these excessive idends wont be used to clean up Polmadie\".The health problems caused to workers at the Whites plant were no secret at the time and neither is the contamination left behind. It has been repeatedly raised over the years, and one site known as Shawfield Phase One has been remediated. However this is only  hectares, and another  hectaresremains affected by contamination.Avant Homes, which is developing the Oatlands housing development has claimed it did not know of the presence of chromium VI or any risk of it, prior to starting work on the Richmond Gate site, the part of Oatlands which is nearest to Polmadie Burn.Tomorrow eveninglocal residents are expected to demand answers of planners at the quarterly Oatlands Steering Group meeting, which is attended by residents, Avant Homes, and representatives of other agencies including Glasgow City Council.Local MSPs are now joining forces to call for funding to clean up the legacy of contamination in the area, after regeneration agency Clyde Gateway said it did not have the tens of millions of pounds a full remediation programme is expected to cost.\"It is good to see the MSPs try to ge the huge funding required to belatedly tackle the pollution,\" Mr Sutton said. \"But they also need to tackle the root cause.\""},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-hails-emergency-services-after-glasgow-university-alert","story":"Officerscarried out a controlled explosion atGlasgowUniversity today following the discovery of a suspicious packageThanks to @policescotland and @UofGlasgow for responding so well to this incident today.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust.

The turnout was  per cent.Prospect has said it will consult representatives next week before confirming industrial action plans. The action is likely to start in April and continue through the summer.This situation arose after HIAL airport controllers sought a pay rise, as they said they were being paid half as much as their counterparts in other areas. However, HIAL said this isn#t the case and proposals were rejected by Scottish Ministers.Prospect negotiations officer David Avery said: “Our members at HIAL undertake highly skilled roles, much in demand across the UK and Europe, but due to public sector pay restraint their pay has fallen signicantly behind the rest of the industry.“Air Traffic Controllers do not want to have to take this action but ministers’ refusal to engage with the issue of pay has left them with no choice. Prospect remains ready to negotiate at any point to avoid this action but ministers must come back to the table with a new meaningful offer.”HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, has responded to news of the ballot, saying: “We are disappointed Air Traffic Controlcolleagues have chosen to take industrial action that is likely to have a signicant impact on passengers and the communities we serve in the Highlands and Islands.#The Prospect union has sought a double-digit pay award. As a government sponsored agency, HIAL must follow the Scottish Government pay policy. We cannot implement pay awards more than that directed by government.#HIAL made a pay award offer to all staff which was accepted following an overall ballot of trade union members and paid to all staff at the end of September .  This was backdated to  April  and saw colleagues receive increases of up to three per cent in line with Scottish Government Pay Remit Guidelines.#Prospect ATC members rejected the pay settlement, but nonetheless received the increase.#We are open to holding further talks with Prospect on a recruitment and retention allowance for Air Traffic Control staff that would further bolster an attractive remuneration package that already includes excellent pension benefits and holiday entitlements.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From isles patients attending hospital appointments to local businesses trying to remain competitive, these services are a genuine leline.“Even at this late stage, we would urge HIAL and the unions to get back round the table and resolve this dispute.  Ministers must also do everything possible to help broker a resolution and avoid the massive disruption any airport closures would inevitably cause.#Following Friday#s announcement from the Prospect union, that air traffic controllers under their membership had voted to undertake industrial action, HIAL said, as a government-sponsored agency, they had to follow the Scottish Government pay policy, and could not implement pay awards more than that directed by the government.A Scottish Government spokesman has since weighed in on the situation, saying: “HIAL has implemented a pay rise for all staff, which is a signicant improvement on previous years, as well as signicantly increasing their contribution to their pension scheme in order to maintain this benefit for employees.

Salmond and Farage, the opposite sides of a nasty #nationalist# coin.And what of British Nationalists Mr Tinkler For example Michael Gove yesterday, banning #Of Mice  Men# and #To Kill a Mockingbird# from school reading lists in England.Can you imagine the SNP doing likewise because the want -% of literature studied to be Scottish Inconceivable.For whatever reason British nationalism # incredibly, even in the form of UKIP # isn#t sneered at the same way as Scottish nationalism.What is your point Carl  Scotland is somehow superior to England because it does not ban “Of Mice  Men” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” from school reading lists. How very petty of you. For information I loathe all nationalism, Scottish, British what is the dference, just raw tribalism by another name.SNP, UKIP, Scottish Independence, United Kingdom Independence, as I said, two sides of a very nasty littlecoin.How verySad andironic, the Scots# inScotland have just elected a UKIP MEP!! I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example.Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead.I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak. A prime example of# not what to do in a political career # lolGod forbidthe Libdemsshould go into bed with UKIP, I think that would most certainly put a stake into the heart of the party lol Mind you, lets hope that UKIP do not get to that level of power where a they rule the roost or b contemplate a coalition with another party.I do believe they are in the same league as the Tories with regard to the Scottish Parliament, in that they have  single representative####.. too many in my books lol# you never fail to amaze me. You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner #lol Malcolm, I was being slightly sarcastic in my response to what literature teachers should be using to teach with ###.but on a more serious point, I do not see why teachers cannot use books written by scottish or british authors to demonstrate literature and its meaning##..within and between the lines. I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much. But they won#t.Are you unable to express your own views Brian  because that link is your longest post by far.Carl Pickard, in answer to # Ian. So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian.

I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

It is hoped that a cross-cultural comparison between the four partner countries will help to explain iations and similarities with regard to gender in entrepreneurship ecosystems. The funding was awarded under Gender-Net Plus, an EU-funded initiative that aims to strengthen links between researchers in dferent countries, and support gender equality through institutional change.Professor Maura McAdam, Professor of Management and Director of Entrepreneurship at DCU’s Business School said: “There is an assumption that all entrepreneurs have equal access to resources, participation and support, as well as an equal chance of a successful outcome.

There was a good each-way shout for Elliott’s Shattered Love , but the Co Meath trainer insisted he’d love to be training Presenting Percy. David Casey was keen on whatever Mullins aims at the race , but cautioned that he wouldn’t back last year’s winner Native River “with stolen money” following his below-par efforts this season.Elliott appears to have great chance of landing the feature on Day One with the brilliant mare Apple’s Jade.Without giving too much away, he added that he “couldn’t be happier” with Apple’s Jade, who is four from four this season.Defending champion Buveur D’Air was friendless at the top table while Casey reported Laurina to be in rude health, but stressed that she would need to improve on her form having won a weak Mares’ Novices’ Hurdle in .Brain Graham feels the seven-pound Mare’s allowance will be a key factor and thinks Apple’s Jade will prevail.Altior , unsurprisingly, was an almost universal tip to retain the Champion Chase with only Winstanley opting for second-favourite Min .If Buveur D’Air was largely opposed by the  in the Champion Hurdle, Stayers’ Hurdle ante-post favourite Paisley Parkwas described as the lay of the meeting by bookmaker Ronan Graham.The  seemed keen to take on the favourite with the reliable Supasundaeand Faugheen .

She had developed a rash last Friday. It worsened over to the weekend to the point her face became badly swollen and she struggled to breathe. Mairead said it had become \"violent\" and her mother told to attend an Accident and Emergency on Sunday night.Her nearest hospital at Omagh informed her there was no doctor available forcing Mairead to take her -year-old mother to Craigavon, almost an hour away.\"We rely on these people, they are the ones that are trained and when you are told you need to go to a hospital you do worry,\" she told the Belfast .The two waited in the AE for almost nine hours with her mother in constant pain as there was no available bed. They were surrounded by people in the \"jam-packed\" waiting room who had also waited hours to see a doctor. One man who had been bleeding for days told them it was his second attempt in an AE before he was forced to leave for work having not been seen again.\"He just thought another day probably wouldnt do any harm and left to try again another day.\"After numerous tests the doctors said they were unable to diagnose the problem which Mairead said was down to how stretched they were and as it was Monday morning at that stage they would try their GP.\"I am not criticising the doctors or nurses, they did a tremendous job but the strain they were under was evident,\" she said\"But this was really frightening and in the hospital it was totally grim.\"Doctors are still not sure what caused the rash to Maireads mother saying it could be an allergic reaction or an infection but her condition has improved since the weekend.Mairead stressed she was not pointing the finger of blame at those health professions, saying they were clearly doing all they could to help but were stretched to beyond breaking point.\"I blame those politicians. We are paying them to do a job and they are not doing it. I have lost total faith - and that is on all sides.\"You have no where to turn. We need change in the health service. There should be clinics or local centres open at evenings of nights to stop people being forced to AE. There were clearly people who did not need to attend hospital when we were there but they didnt have a choice.\"We have been let down badly\"Despite millions in extra funding pouring into the Northern Ireland health service, officials say what is needed is radical reform.Mairead posted about her experience on Facebook with thousands reacting. She said a number of nurses contacted to tell her such was the pressure they were forced out of the health service.\"People need to demand better. We are paying our politicians for something they are not doing and we are becoming third class citizens. Change is urgently needed.\"\"If nothing comes out of this, I just hope someone takes a stand. We as the next generation need to stand up and be counted. We can’t just talk about it anymore. Enough is enough.A spokesperson for the Southern Trust said: \"Response from the Southern Trust as requested.\"Our hospitals, like others across Northern Ireland are currently very busy.  Despite the pressures, our staff continue to prioritise the most seriously ill patients, so those with less urgent symptoms may regrettably experience longer waits. We are using all resource available to us to best manage the situation.\"The Southern Trust and others continue to face pressures particularly during winter when there are more ill patients who need admitted to hospital.\"We are very focused on discharging patients in a timely manner so that beds are available for acutely ill patients and ask for the support of family and friends to help ensure that we can get patients home as quickly as possible. \"Also during this time we appeal to the public to only come to the Emergency Departmentyour condition is serious and urgent and to please consider your alternatives – your GP surgery, local pharmacy or Minor Injury Unit.\""},{"url":null,"title":"charles speaks of his faith in enduring friendship with ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are some big issues at stake.”Mr Coveney said it was important to celebrate the “extraordinarily vibrant and overwhelmingly positive connections” enjoyed by the UK and Ireland.

As everyone knows, Dromara is a strong club but this year surpassed all expectations with the club being the only one in Ireland to have its members win two INFC Nationals.N Black  Son won the Friendship National and N Edgar  Son won the Skibbereen National.The Edgar partnership had a fantastic young bird season as well, winning the NIPA Young Bird National from Rosscarbery.N Black  Son also won the NIPA section D Old Bird Channel fancier. Russell Brothers also had another great season winning the highly prized McBride Cup for the channel averages plus winning Penzance Classic.C  L Fryers had the first bird from Dromara in the Kingrsquos Cup. McKinstry Brothers had some great results along with T Marshall  Son, first bird in Penzance Young Bird, D McCandless Yearling National winner.Mr  Mrs Stevenson again did well inland as well as beating the big boys on the channel by winning first Tallbenny.H Silcock had some great positions and were unlucky to be fourth open Friendship National and still be only second in the club.After the prizes and trophies were handed out Mrs Rooney presented Fiona Stevenson with a bouquet of flowers mdash a small token of thanks for the hospitality from her and Bobby throughout the year.As usual, the highlight of the evening was the ballot and with Stanley McKinstry not attending this year his luck was taken up by Fiona Stevenson.In fact they won so many young birds Bobby thought he might not even have to breed any of his own. N Edgar  Son and N Black  Son kindly donated two young birds each.Edgarrsquos two were won by new member Chris Rooney and Mr  Mrs Stevenson and Blackrsquos two young birds were won by Gordon Kirkpatrick and Mr  Mrs Stevenson.C  l Fryersrsquo young bird was won by non-fancier William Skelly, who is putting it into the stable of N Black  Son to be raced.Cromie  Magee and Sonsrsquo was won by Russell Bros, Mr  Mrs Stevensonrsquos by Chris Rooney, Russell Bros by H Silcock, T Marshall  Sonrsquos by Mr  Mrs Stevenson and A Bradleyrsquos was won by P Connor..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Conal Montgomery samples new sound  ","story":"KILLYLEAGH rocker Conal Montgomery is working on new original music for the first time in years.The well-known singer who has performed at bikersrsquo rallies and conventions around the UK for the last  years may surprise some of his fans with his new sound.Instead of the soaring progressive rock vocals he is known for, Conalrsquos new music is softer, more reflective folk style.The  year-old says that his new music is indicative of where he is in his personal le now.The  year-old explained: ldquoI havenrsquot felt like this for years particularly as when I was drinking I really couldnrsquot be bothered with writing music.ldquoI wrote songs in the early s but alcohol and drugs just took over my le and my time was wasted.ldquoFor  odd years I didnrsquot do anything and now that Irsquom sober, I just have a love for it. I just want to try and put out what Irsquove been feeling for a long time.Conal first developed a love for music by listening to his big brotherrsquos Elvis Presley records.He later began to perform as the lead singer with the local band Bone Idle before moving on to Freak Out and then to Sweet Leaf mdash the band he fronted for  years.ldquoIrsquove been fronting rock bands for the last  years since my early twenties and it was always just covers like AC DC, Led Zeppelin and Lynyrd Skynyrd, Conal continued.ldquoBut when I started to write music, that wasnrsquot what was coming out of me. It was more singer songwriter, folky stuff.ldquoIt wasnrsquot really a surprise to me as the stuff I would have listened to outside my giging would have been the likes of Bob Dylan and Steve Earle.Conal is recording his new songs with the band Stillwater, which also features Killyleagh musician Damien Hanna.While he is experiencing a creative purple patch, the father-of-four does not yet know when the music will be available.ldquoI donrsquot have a title for my new EP yet as Irsquom still writing and Irsquom still recording. I would hope that the EP would be out by the summer and the album by the end of the year but you never know, the EP could turn into the album.He and Stillwater performed two of Conalrsquos new tracks, Venus and All of the People, in an interview on That Like That on NVTV.Conal says that the second track is really resonating with people.ldquoThis track is aimed at society in general, not only young people on Facebook, but all those who point the finger at somebody and gang up on some poor soul, he explained.ldquoThen when something happens to that poor soul, then yoursquoll get the smiley faces and comments of lsquoHe was a great fellarsquo or lsquoShe was a great girlrsquo and hopefully it teaches them a lesson to realise what people might be going through on the inside.Conal is a regular at Denvirrsquos in Downpatrick and will next perform with Stillwater in Portrush Town Hall at the North West  in MayTo watch Conalrsquos interview and performance on NVTVrsquos Talk Like That visit twww.nvtv shows talk-like-that-conal-montgomery Conal and Stillwater on their Facebook pages or ring Conal on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"De La Salle head ‘disappointed’ at decision  ","story":"THE principal of De La Salle School in Downpatrick has spoken of his ldquodisappointment in this weekrsquos statement from the Red High Parents and Friends Association.Mr Ciaran Maguire called on all four schools earmarked for the proposed lsquosuper schoolrsquo in Downpatrick ldquoto come together and put their best foot forward.Mr Maguire said he was disappointed for the trustees of De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos, who ldquohave given so much of their lives to the families in East Down.He described their involvement in education has been one of ldquogreat success and achievement.Mr Maguire said De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos were ldquotwo highly effective schools meeting the needs of young men and women in the greater Downpatrick area.He said the trustees had the confidence of staff, pupils and parents at De La Salle and from the wider business community.Mr Maguire remarked: ldquoWithin my last two years as principal of De La Salle, I have witnessed on a daily basis children going to and from St Patrickrsquos, to St Maryrsquos to De La Salle, accessing a curriculum that isnrsquot possible within their own school and sharing both the knowledge and expertise from each of these schools, where the results have been nothing short of excellent for each pupil.ldquoThis collaboration has been up and running successfully for years and is a model of good practice for other post-primary schools to see.ldquoWhat is wrong in having a rsquosuper schoolrsquo  Do the families in the greater Downpatrick area not deserve it  A school where children regardless of ability can achieve their potential He continued: ldquoThe new school will cater for every child. No child will be disadvantaged or be selected to attend this new school. For once they will have control over their choice of post-primary education.ldquoWhat is proposed is a Catholic school, with a strong Catholic Lasallian ethos. No child will be turned away because of not making the threshold grade.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty. It is also a hazard to pedestrians.ldquoIt is illegal to deposit mud on the public highway. Why the Conservative Independent Council has been so ineffective is beyond me.ldquoNot content with creating these awful conditions a trench has been excavated across the entrance to the busy Medical Centre.ldquoThis resulted in the entrance being narrowed.The failure to engage with the Medical Centre is a disgrace.The trench excavation was carried out by the Gas Transportation Company Ltd in a separate development.The medical centre used Facebook to warn residents attempting to access the site that contractors had partially blocked the entrance.Plaid Councillor Richard Grigg said: ldquoThis site has been operational since last summer.ldquoIt is only now that hopefully a decent wheel wash has been installed.ldquoWhy has the County Council been so uncaring about this situation ldquoThey have a duty to protect the community.ldquoThe site which was sold to the builders by the council for millions has been a real problem with huge contractorsrsquo vehicles causing chaos on local roads. The planning process has totally failed Dinas Powys.Steve Williams, managing director of Barratt Homes South Wales, said: ldquoWe always strive to minimise the effects of construction and apologise to anyone who has been inconvenienced by work in Dinas Powys.ldquoWe have a jet wash on site during opening hours to clean the tyres of vehicles leaving the development throughout the day.The construction is part of the Local Development Plan that will see , new homes built in the Vale of Glamorgan over the next eight years.Planning permission had been granted in February , despite criticisms of the impact that the new site would have on congestion in and around Dinas Powys, which, planning officers confirmed, is already at maximum capacity.While acknowledging extra homes would generate more traffic, officers said increases would be negligible and traffic around Murch Road and Cardf Road would be over capacity in several years regardless. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty. It is also a hazard to pedestrians.ldquoIt is illegal to deposit mud on the public highway. Why the Conservative Independent Council has been so ineffective is beyond me.ldquoNot content with creating these awful conditions a trench has been excavated across the entrance to the busy Medical Centre.ldquoThis resulted in the entrance being narrowed.The failure to engage with the Medical Centre is a disgrace.The trench excavation was carried out by the Gas Transportation Company Ltd in a separate development.The medical centre used Facebook to warn residents attempting to access the site that contractors had partially blocked the entrance.Plaid Councillor Richard Grigg said: ldquoThis site has been operational since last summer.ldquoIt is only now that hopefully a decent wheel wash has been installed.ldquoWhy has the County Council been so uncaring about this situation ldquoThey have a duty to protect the community.ldquoThe site which was sold to the builders by the council for millions has been a real problem with huge contractorsrsquo vehicles causing chaos on local roads. The planning process has totally failed Dinas Powys.Steve Williams, managing director of Barratt Homes South Wales, said: ldquoWe always strive to minimise the effects of construction and apologise to anyone who has been inconvenienced by work in Dinas Powys.ldquoWe have a jet wash on site during opening hours to clean the tyres of vehicles leaving the development throughout the day.The construction is part of the Local Development Plan that will see , new homes built in the Vale of Glamorgan over the next eight years.Planning permission had been granted in February , despite criticisms of the impact that the new site would have on congestion in and around Dinas Powys, which, planning officers confirmed, is already at maximum capacity.While acknowledging extra homes would generate more traffic, officers said increases would be negligible and traffic around Murch Road and Cardf Road would be over capacity in several years regardless. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With collections taking part in all towns, thanks to all who helped collect in the towns, not forgetting the many marshals under the direction of Francie and Barry Lappin.The Livingstones said: “It is fantastic to bring the total raised to over £, with the total raised from the event started in , we never thought this would be possible. The event receives great support from the many volunteers and helpers who attend meetings, steward, collect, cook and help us in so many ways not just on the day, but at the many meetings in events – we thank them for their continued support – without them it would not be possible.”The family also thanks the local companies who provided sponsorship or donations towards the events.

masterplan to consider future of oxford island  ","story":"A new marina at Kinnego could be part of the Masterplan for Oxford Island organised by Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council.The masterplan, which is still at development stage, has been having consultations with ious interest groups such as NI Environment Agency and tourism groups.Leisure Services chief Gerard Houlihan said Oxford Island is a great asset to the council area but currently is a bit of a ‘hotch potch’.He said the aim of the masterplan is to get direction on how to build on Oxford Island’s popularity.“It is about branding it and bringing it together,” he said.The council has been consulting with key stakeholders to help the development of the facility and services on site for all users.While the public has not been directly ‘consulted’ there has been an online survey with questions asking them for their opinions.Eight questions such as how often do you visit and why, as well as what improvements would you make to Oxford Island form part of the survey. MrHoulihan said: “The overall purpose of the Oxford Island Master Plan is to provide a strategic framework for the sustainable development and management of Oxford Island over the next ten years.”Mr Houlihan explained that currently there is a lot going on in Oxford Island but a ‘hotch potch’.“What we are trying to do is streamline that and give Oxford Island its own identity.“We have the masterplan, we have spoken to councillors, we have spoken to businesses, we have spoken to staff on the site and now we are speaking to the public.”However, Mr Houlihan said the masterplan has not yet been completed: “We haven’t produced the masterplan yet.

We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range.

What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector.
