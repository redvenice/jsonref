The baby boy strapped into the back seat escaped serious injury. Both drivers were breath-tested and provided negative readings.The very next day, the Queen was spotted driving on a public road without a seatbelt.

And in February 2002 (pictured right) he and the Queen drove back to Windsor Castle after attending church at the royal lodge but the Queen was not wearing her seatbelt          At the same event two years later the Queen was once again at the wheel unharnessed          The Queen was pictured without a seatbelt arriving to give her pointed speech about compromise, widely believed to be directed at politicians fighting about Brexit, at the Sandringham Women\u0027s Institute (WI) meeting at West Newton Village Hall this weekThe Queen\u0027s children have a mixed record when it comes to buckling up, with some seeming to be much more conscientious than others.Prince Andrew has been seen wearing his seatbelt on numerous occasions, but his older sister Princess Anne seems to take things less seriously.Prince Charles tends to buckle up these days but was more lax in the 1980s as this photograph shows.          In this undated file photograph Princes Charles looks to be enjoying driving his Aston Martin without a seatbelt. The D prefix on the number plate means this photograph cannot pre-date 1986 - a full three years after it became law for drivers to wear seatbelts          Several years later with his teenage sons in the back the Prince of Wales was buckled up for the journey to the Easter service at Crathie Kirk in Balmoral          A lavish dinner was held in 2007 to mark the then-forthcoming diamond wedding anniversary of the Queen and Prince Philip. Princess Anne arrived at Clarence House without a seat belt on          Princess Anne was chauffeured to family Christmas  last December but relaxed in the back of her Bentley without a belt for safety          On the day of Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding her family - Prince Andrew, Sarah Ferguson, and Princess Beatrice - all went unbuckled too          Prince Edward drove his rover away from the Hyatt Carlton Hotel in London safely strapped in          Prince Andrew buckled up safely to drive his friends away from The Rock nightclub in London          But Prince Andrew seems not to have strapped himself in, in the back seat, leaving churchIf the Queen and Prince Philip seem to have the most lax attitude to strapping in, and their children can be a little hit-and-miss, the younger generation of royals seem much more consistent in their approach to road safety.At the wedding of the now Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011, the happy couple drove a vintage Aston Martin without either belting up. And last year Harry and Meghan also took to an open-topped car in order to smile and wave at well-wishers without seatbelts on.On one or two other occasions the Cambridges and the Sussexes have been spotted without their belts on, but in the main the couples seem to be happy to strap in.          The future king in military uniform and his bride in her wedding dress waved to crowds with the roof of their convertible down - but were not buckled up          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were all smiles behind the wheel on their wedding day in May 2018 but neither Harry nor Meghan seem to be wearing a seatbelt  In 2017 (left, in London) and again last year (right, in Norway) the Duchess of Cambridge was spotted without a seatbelt on          But when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive for Prince of Wales 70th party both were safely strapped in          This picture from a car journey back from the Queen\u0027s Christmas lunch may feature some revealing facial expressions - but at least William looks to be wearing his seatbelt  Kate\u0027s seatbelt is clearly visible across her bold pink ensemble worn in December 2018   The Duchess of Sussex arrived at the same event last month safely strapped in to her seat          Harry\u0027s seatbelt is clearly visible across his shoulder as he and his wife arrive for Christmas lunch with his family Former royal protection officer Simon Morgan, told Hello magazine earlier this month that sometimes royals go belt-less for their own safety, for example if they might need to make a quick escape.He said: \u0027There are always anomalies. In the threat and risk matrix it\u0027s a matter of looking at each inidual situation to decide what is the best way of achieving what needs to be achieved.\u0027For example, considering that a quick entry or exit to a vehicle is easier when people aren\u0027t strapped into seatbelts.\u0027He suggested sometimes personal preference was allowed to trump the law of the land, however, adding: \u0027Is an inidual\u0027s look and appearance important? And also an inidual\u0027s choice\u0027.Prince Philip was described as \u0027conscious but very shocked and shaken\u0027 after a dramatic crash near his Sandringham Estate which left two women in the other vehicle in hospital and the Land Rover he was driving on its side in a crumpled heap   Philip is believed to have just left Sandringham, circled red, and was turning on to the A149  at this junction when he collided with a Kia and his car cartwheeled on to the other side of the road, circled blue  Norfolk Police have declined to ulge details of the crash investigation, saying it was \u0027ongoing\u0027. But they have confirmed they carried out an eyesight test which the Prince passed. It is understood the Duke was asked to read a number plate from 65ft away.Cameras fitted to Royal cars for security reasons are thought to be able to record and transmit live images to personal protection officers. It is understood that the cameras on Philip\u0027s Land Rover were filming from several angles as the accident unfolded.If the footage suggests that Philip was at fault and driving carelessly, then it could be used as evidence in a prosecution. Magistrates would have the power to fine him £5,000, disqualify him from driving or put nine penalty points on his licence.

After months of reporting, this story went through Esquire\u0027s editorial process, which included fact-checking and vetting by a Hearst attorney, and the story was approved for publication.\u0027The men then added: \u0027The story was then killed by Hearst executives. We do not know why.\u0027          Anyway the wind blows: Bohemian Rhapsody star Rami Malek claimed that the allegations \u0027were, believe it or not, honestly something I was not aware of, and that is what it is\u0027 (Singer and Malek above on the set of Rhapsody with Ben Hardy and Queen drummer Roger Taylor)          Silent film stars: \u0027With Bohemian Rhapsody being an award-winning hit, this homophobic smear piece has been conveniently timed to take advantage of its success,\u0027 said Singer(above with Jennifer Lawrence, Hugh Jackman and Michael Fassbender in 2015)Singer has been aware for months that a story was in the works, and commented on the planned expose around the time it was killed.\u0027The last time I posted about this subject, Esquire magazine was preparing to publish an article written by a homophobic journalist who has a bizarre obsession with me dating back to 1997,\u0027 aid Singer.\u0027After careful fact-checking and, in consideration of the lack of credible sources, Esquire chose not to publish this piece of vendetta journalism.\u0027He then wet on to call the story of homophobic. \u0027That didn\u0027t stop this writer from selling it to The Atlantic. It\u0027s sad that The Atlantic would stoop to this low standard of journalistic integrity,\u0027 said Singer.\u0027Again, I am forced to reiterate that this story rehashes claims from bogus lawsuits filed by a disreputable cast of iniduals willing to lie for money or attention. And it is no surprise that, with Bohemian Rhapsody being an award-winning hit, this homophobic smear piece has been conveniently timed to take advantage of its success.\u0027Four new men have come forward to share their stories, which are remarkably similar to those shared by a number of men in the past.The youngest accuser claims that he was just 13 when Singer molested him on a film set, while others recount being plied with drugs and alcohol before being led to a bedroom by the director.That youngest victim said that as he watched the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfold, he started to thing: \u0027Me too—only I was a kid.\u0027Among the men speaking out is Victor Valdovinos, who claims that he was 13 when Singer, then in his 30s, molested him on the set of Apt Pupil.He claims that Singer first approached him in a bathroom at his school, and then asked him to be in the film. Valdovinos arrived on the set the next day only to be told to strip, put on a towel and then hidden away in a room.   \u0027I’m hanging out. All of a sudden, Bryan comes in. He goes, ‘Hey! How are you? Real cheerful. And I’m like, Hi,\u0027 said Valdovinos.           Him too: A British John Doe (above) who claims Singer raped him in London \u0027I can’t remember his exact words, but he was kind of just saying Come back here. He kind of directs me he kind of grabs me and he takes us to the back area, which was kind of closed off. \u0027He went on to say: \u0027I was back here, in the towel, with no shirt and no clothes on, sitting on one of the locker-room benches. Bryan’s like, Just hang out here. It’s going to be all day. Don’t worry.\u0027Singer allegedly paid multiple visits to the seventh-grade student throughout the day.\u0027Every time he had a chance - three times - he would go back there\u0027 claimed Valdoinos. \u0027He was always touching my chest.\u0027Then, at one point, Singer allegedly \u0027grabbed my genitals and started masturbating it\u0027 and then \u0027rubbed his front part on me,.\u0027Valdoinos said: \u0027He did it all with this smile.\u0027He also allegedly told the boy: \u0027You’re so good-looking … I really want to work with you … I have a nice Ferrari … I’m going to take care of you.\u0027Valdoinos said he was \u0027frozen speechless,\u0027 and alleged that Singer returned three times throughout the day. Within a few years he was a father after getting his teenage girlfriend pregnant, and went from being an Honor\u0027s student to failing his classes. He dropped out, was arrested on battery and drug possession charges, and eventually served time in prison.\u0027What if he never did this to me—would I be a different person? Would I be more successful? Would I be married?\u0027 wondered Valdoinos.   Alleged victim: One of the accusers alleged that Singer had a relationship with the late actor Brad Renfro (left in Singer\u0027s 1998 film Apt Pupil), right being arrested for trying to purchase heroin in 2005)          Firing back: Singer has denied all allegations of rape, molestation, or engaging in inappropriate contact with a minor (Singer above with former lover Bret Tyler)          The allegations against Singer were first reported back in 2014 when Michael Egan (above) accused the director of rape.Another accuser, who did not want to use his real name, said he was kicked out of his home at 16 because he was gay, and that was how he came to meet Singer. They made out once when he was 16 said the accuser, who also alleged that the pair  had oral sex when he was 17 or 18 at one of Singer\u0027s parties. \u0027He would stick his hands down your pants without your consent,\u0027 he claimed. \u0027He was predatory in that he would ply people with alcohol and drugs and then have sex with them.\u0027Another accuser, referred to as Andy, said he came to meet Singer after he was allegedly raped by Marc Collins-Rector multiple times. That all started when Andy was just 14, and he claims that was soon being flown on private planes to see Rector from his home in Las Vegas. He met Singer at a party while the director was with Brad Renfro, who passed away in 2008 at the age of 25 from a heroin overdose.The three men went to a room, where Andy alleges he was raped by Singer.\u0027Bryan knew I was 15,\u0027 said Andy.\u0027I remember wanting Brad to join in. I don’t think Brad was gay, or even bi. I think he was going with the flow. We talked about it. Like me, he looked around at all of the things these guys had, all of the money. Maybe he thought the guys were going to do things for him.\u0027He also claimed that Singer did not try and hide what as happening in the room. \u0027I just remember how loud the moaning was. I remember thinking, God, there’s a big group of people downstairs hanging out in the living room, and they can probably hear him,\u0027 aid Andy. \u0027That bothered me, so I stuck my hand over his mouth or in his mouth just to stop it. When we went downstairs, it was really awkward. I just acted like it was no big thing.\u0027This happened a few more times he claimed, and a few years later Singer allegedly lost interest in Andy. He began to abuse drugs, and would come to call on Singer for money at times.Andy eventually checked into court-ordered rehab however and has now been clean for two years. \u0027I sort of wonder, if I’d never met Marc and then Bryan, if I would have ever got into the drugs,\u0027 said Andy.          No idea: The producers and actors who worked on Bohemian Rhapsody claim that they were unaware of the allegations against Singer (cast and crew above accepting the Golden Globe for Best Picture)          Accuser: Victor Valdovinos (above) claims that he was 13 when Singer, then in his 30s, molested him on the set of Apt PupilEric, who also asked that his name be withheld, alleged that he was just 17 when he had sex with a 31-year-old Singer.He claimed that Singer was surrounded by two types of young men.\u0027If you weren’t young and cute enough to be their boy, you could still ingratiate yourself by bringing boys to them,\u0027 he said of Singer and his cohorts. They had a sexual relationship for five years according to Eric, until Singer lost interest in him.\u0027I never want people to think of me as a victim, so I always put up the front of I’m good. I was in charge,\u0027 said Eric.\u0027But I spent a decade in therapy trying to figure out if what happened was bad or not bad. And if it was bad, was it my fault? What I’ve decided is that adults are supposed to look out for kids.\u0027He also said that he is now in Alcoholic\u0027s Anonymous, where he allegedly runs into a number of Singer\u0027s former boys. \u0027There’s a bunch of us\u0027 he said.\u0027It’s like, You were one of Singer’s boys? Me too.\u0027 Gabe Hoffman of An Open Secret also responded to the allegations, telling DailyMail.com: \u0027In October 2018, after Bryan Singer\u0027s false attack on Alex and Max\u0027s work - I personally offered to buy, insure, and bankroll the story if Esquire ever did not want it. That is the level of confidence I have in the accuracy of their journalism.\u0027Bryan Singer resorts to false homophobic slurs in his response - because he has absolutely no defense for his crimes upon children in Hollywood.

Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you\u0027re in league with Maduro and his mayhem,\u0027 Pompeo told the council. \u0027We call on all members of the Security Council to support Venezuela\u0027s democratic transition and interim President Guaido\u0027s role.\u0027          Pompeo urged countries to financially disconnect from Nicolas Maduro\u0027s (shown) government. Maduro has led oil-rich Venezuela since 2013 and has the armed forces\u0027 supportPompeo also called on the international community to disconnect their financial systems from Maduro\u0027s regime. Washington has signaled it was ready to step up economic measures to try to drive Maduro from power, but on Saturday Pompeo declined to elaborate on any such plans.By overcoming opposition to holding the U.N. meeting on Saturday, Washington successfully put the global spotlight on Venezuela as a Security Council problem. However, any council action to address the crisis would be blocked by veto-powers Russia and China, diplomats said.Britain, Germany, France and Spain all said on Saturday they would recognize Guaido if Maduro failed to call fresh elections in eight days, an ultimatum Russia said was \u0027absurd\u0027 and the Venezuelan foreign minister called \u0027childlike.\u0027\u0027Europe is giving us eight days? Where do you get that you have the power to establish a deadline or an ultimatum to a sovereign people?\u0027 Venezuela\u0027s Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Security Council.Russia also said military intervention in Venezuela should be avoided at any cost, while Caracas reiterated that its offer of dialogue with President Donald Trump\u0027s government was still on the table despite his administration\u0027s two-year campaign against Maduro.\u0027If President Trump, like other presidents of the United States, is in search of war to show he can govern and to stimulate the economy, he won\u0027t get that war in Venezuela,\u0027 Arreaza told reporters later.Russia blames \u0027shameless and aggressive\u0027 U.S for crisis in...Share this article    Opposition leader Juan Guaido is supported by the US, Canada and other countriesVenezuela has sunk into turmoil under Maduro with food shortages and daily protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration and inflation that is seen rising to 10 million percent this year.Maduro cruised to re-election last May amid low turnout and allegations of vote buying by the government. The domestic opposition, the United States and right-leaning Latin American governments declined to recognize the result of the ballot.Venezuelan opposition sympathizers had been urging Guaido to assume the presidency since Maduro was inaugurated for a second term on January 10. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in Caracas earlier this week, calling on Maduro to step down.Guaido\u0027s declaration of himself as the interim president takes Venezuela into uncharted territory, with the possibility of the opposition now running a parallel government recognized abroad as legitimate but without control over state functions.On Saturday, Guaido celebrated the support of European countries and asked them to send humanitarian aid to help relieve the economic crisis. \u0027We woke up today with nothing less than the full support of the European community,\u0027 Guaido said at a small political event in a square in the capital Caracas.\u0027Several European countries have been in touch with us and are going to support the entry of humanitarian aid. ... We continue adding countries to this great effort,\u0027 he said.The Maduro government has previously rejected such aid, denying there is a humanitarian crisis in the country and blaming economic problems on sanctions.After Washington\u0027s declaration of support for Guaido, Maduro cut off diplomatic relations with the United States on Wednesday and gave U.S. diplomats 72 hours to leave the country.Although some diplomats left on Friday, Guaido said the U.S. embassy was still working and that embassy officials had been to visit him."},{"url":null,"title":"Campaigners battling stop council building 60 homes park told plan IMPROVE area","story":"    Developers have vowed to improve the area by replacing Wandon Park with a larger park nearby, which they say may include sports facilities.

IT’s JUST BIOLOGYKatharine Graves, hypnobirthing expertCradling a bump is something that’s hardwired into women from a biological perspective.Women are instinctively drawn to touching their babies because, even when they’re in the womb, it produces a hormone called oxytocin. This hormone is known as the bonding hormone, but it also affects the strength of your contractions in labour.The more oxytocin in your system, the stronger your contractions will be, which can lead to an easier birth. Placing your hands on your bump comforts the baby, comforts you, and helps create the optimum conditions for labour.kghypnobirthing.com  The left hand touch: Cusping baby in London last month (right), in Birkenhead, (centre), and with Harry in Australia (left)DUCHESS OF SHOWBIZ IS JUST SEEKING A PHOTO OP Jo Elvin, Editor of You MagazineI’ve tried not to find it annoying, but I’m sorry, it just is. A casual cradling of one’s bump is to be expected. It’s new, it’s exciting and there really is nothing like feeling that thing kick and jump around in there.But Meghan’s positioning is always so fixed into one singular, rigid pose that it’s becoming uncomfortable to watch. I’m getting arm aches just looking. It’s all very Baby Bump Barbie.Kinder people would point to an excited new mother’s natural, unconditional love already blossoming. True enough, in which case I hope its sibling isn’t far behind, or that poor kid’s clearly in for a smothering.But come on, this is the Duchess of Showbiz we have here. It smacks to me of a focus that’s contrived and relentlessly photo-op ready. Meghan would be well advised to take the ‘world’s only pregnant woman!’ vibes down a notch or two.  Talk to the bump! The Duchess seems to be including the baby in her conversations in London this month (right) and last month (left)A WOMAN SHOWING A NEW-FOUND RESERVE Harry Witchel, body language expert Meghan tends to cup her bump by knitting her fingers together – a sign of holding back and being more grounded. That’s quite a contrast to her usual behaviour, which involves dealing with the world with gusto. As a Royal she is expected to be more reserved, so is this a subconscious attempt to be so?This doesn’t look like acting. This looks like a woman aware of a change in her body.          The handbag shield: Meghan covers the bump with her clutch bag in  in Fiji  Ultimate Accessory: Meghan covers the bump with her handbag in London this month (right) and in October (left)A SIGN OF HER DELIGHT AT BEING PREGNANT Alexandra Shulman, Mos columnistA lot of women feel comforted by touching their baby bump but Meghan appears to indulge more than most. It happened even before she had a discernible bump, and I imagine some of this is because she is so delighted to be pregnant. Possibly, at 37, she wasn’t sure it would happen so quickly.But there may be another story. All Royals have a method of preventing their arms from flailing around in a chaotic fashion when they are out and about. Meghan is using her bump as a way to keep her hands calm, while showing how protective she is.SHE LOOKS AS DEMURE AS THE VIRGIN MARY Alison Jackson, photographer Meghan\u0027s arms framing the bump very clearly shows that she is pregnant, rather than just looking large. I think she’s also very consciously making the effort to break up the solid colour of her outfits.After years as an actress, she’ll be very aware of camera angles and how to work them, and how to create flattering shapes with her body.I also think she resembles the image of the Virgin Mary: demure and regal, carrying the most precious cargo. She’s definitely very pleased with herself about that.instagram.comalisonjacksonartist          Photographer Alison Jackson says Meghan\u0027s arms framing the bump very clearly shows that she is pregnantIGNORE THE BACKLASH, THIS IS A BIG POSITIVE Julianne Boutaleb, psycholgistIt’s interesting to see such a backlash against a woman who is interacting with her bump in this way. But I see it as a very positive thing. It indicates a good attachment to the unborn baby.I work with a lot of women who struggle to develop a bond with their child, whether due to difficulty conceiving, miscarriage, or birth trauma. But a woman who is cradling her bump is showing that she’s very engaged, both emotionally and physically, with her unborn child.parenthoodinmind.co.uk    Psychologist Julianne Boutaleb sees it as a very positive thing and it indicates a good attachment to the unborn babyIT’S MEGHAN’S CLOAK OF INVULNERABILITY Linda Kelsey, former editor of Cosmopolitan  Everyone else constantly paws you when you’re pregnant, so why shouldn’t Meghan take things into her own hands? Personally, I’ve never felt as strong and invulnerable as when my belly was ballooning.I would march into meetings with my doctor, feeling nothing he could say could burst my sense of well-being. And in case he missed the point I’d cradle my belly for added effect.Meghan has had a hard time of it lately with attacks on a number of fronts. But when you’re pregnant and loving it nothing else really matters.Every time she cradles her bump, it’s a case of you and me against the world, babe – and she’s rocking it.IF THIS IS HER ACTING, IT’s A MASSIVE CLICHE Dee Cannon, acting coachWhen you’re teaching an actor to ‘play’ pregnant, the preparation involves holding the back. Cradling the bump is not really something you’d ask an actor to do – it’s such a demonstrative gesture that it could be seen as a cliche. So when a woman is doing that in real life, you can choose to interpret it in either a positive or a negative way – either it’s a subconscious, instinctive, nurturing, maternal gesture, or they’re proud and overly protective.deecannon.com          Acting coach Dee Cannon says cradling the bump is not really something you’d ask an actor to do – it’s such a demonstrative gesture that it could be seen as a clicheWHAT’S SO UNNATURAL IN LOVING YOUR BUMP?Bonita Turner, editor of Junior Magazine I imagine it’s reassuring for Meghan to put her hands on her baby. I don’t think she’s doing it to show off, and I imagine that people saying that have never been pregnant. It’s natural to be proud of your bump. You only have it for nine months and it is quite special.CONSTANT STROKING IS HELPING BABY LEARN Tamara Bugembe, paediatrician WE HAVE known for a long time that babies respond to voices and sounds from outside the womb, and they also move their arms, head and mouths more when the bump was stroked. Some babies would reach out and touch the walls of the uterus.Touching your bump is good for the baby’s development. Meghan may not know it, but her constant stroking and rubbing is helping develop the baby’s co-ordination and movements.drtamarab.comA POSITIVE SIGN SHE LOVES HER NEW BODY Holli Rubin, body image expertSome women love how they look when pregnant. Others hate it. A woman’s body image pre-pregnancy very much influences how she feels, looks and presents herself. When we feel good in ourselves, we tend to present ourselves in a very different way to when we don’t – and putting your hand on the bump in this way is a positive sign.hollirubin.com          Body image expert Holli Rubin says putting your hand on the bump in this way is a positive signMAKING THE MOST OF HER NEW SHAPE Renee Rispin, stylist \u0026amp blogger Some women find it hard to make the most of their changing body shape and hide their bumps – but Meghan isn’t one of them. Choosing to wear striking colours such as the purple dress and red coat she wore on a recent visit to Birkenhead is a clear message that not only does she want to show off her bump, but also that being pregnant doesn’t mean she’s taken her finger off the fashion pulse.mummystyle.co.ukSHE LOVES TO SHOW THAT SHE’S A ‘FAT LADY’ Katie Nicholl, royal authorHaving observed Meghan on official engagements, her bump patting seems to be second nature – it’s her new prop.It’s endearing, but a little distracting.

Colonel Jose Luis Silva, Venezuela\u0027s military attache in the United States, has declared his support for Juan Guaido after defecting from Nicolas Maduro\u0027s governmentMaduro\u0027s foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, had already rejected the deadline during an emergency UN Security Council meeting. Guaidó declared himself \u0027acting president\u0027 on Wednesday, gaining the backing of several countries with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo launching a fiery speech at the United Nations on Saturday, slamming Venezuela\u0027s dictatorial regime under Maduro as an \u0027illegitimate mafia state\u0027. Col Silva\u0027s intervention is a blow to Maduro, with the armed forces seen as crucial in the current struggle. \u0027No more delays, no more games\u0027: Mike Pompeo slams Maduro\u0027s...\u0027Extend the hand of friendship\u0027: Protesters in Venezuela...Share this articleVenezuela\u0027s defence ministry said Col Silva was guilty of treason, and tweeted photos of him with the word \u0027traitor\u0027 plastered over them. Guaido recently asked the army  to \u0027put themselves on the side of the Venezuelan people\u0027.In a video filmed at the Venezuelan embassy in Washington, Col Silva said: \u0027The armed forces have a fundamental role in the restoration of the democracy in our country. Please, brothers, do not attack our people.\u0027          In response to news of his defection, Venezuela\u0027s defence ministry said Col Silva was guilty of treason, and tweeted photos of him with the word \u0027traitor\u0027 on themHe also urged his \u0027brothers in the armed forces of the nation to recognise President Juan Guaido as the only legitimate president\u0027.Guaido celebrated Silva\u0027s decision to defect.\u0027We welcome him and everyone who with honesty want to follow the constitution and the will of the Venezuelan people,\u0027 he said on social media after attending a small assembly in Caracas to discuss the opposition\u0027s next moves.Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for US National Security Council, encouraged others to follow Silva\u0027s lead \u0027to protect constitutional order, not to sustain dictators and repress its own people.\u0027           Despite the pressure Maduro is under, he has so far retained the support of the country\u0027s military          Opposition leader Juan Guaido is supported by the US, Canada and other countries as the rightful leader of Venezuela Venezuela\u0027s top commanders have pledged loyalty to Maduro\u0027s government in the days since Guaido declared himself interim leader on grounds that Maduro\u0027s re-election last year was fraudulent - an allegation supported by the US, the European Union and many Latin American nations.But support for Maduro\u0027s rule is weaker among the military\u0027s rank and file, whose households are suffering from widespread food shortages and hyperinflation like their civilian counterparts. Last week, a small National Guard unit stole a stockpile of weapons in what it said was an attempt to oust Maduro. The uprising was quelled and 25 guardsmen arrested.          Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged the United Nations Security Council members to pick a side to support in Venezuela\u0027s leadership struggle Saturday          \u0027No more delays, no more games. Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you\u0027re in league with Maduro and his mayhem,\u0027 Pompeo said at the United Nations Security Council meeting on Saturday The standoff has plunged troubled Venezuela into a new chapter of political turmoil that rights groups say has already left more than two dozen dead as thousands take to the street demanding Maduro step down. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council during a meeting on Saturday to \u0027pick a side\u0027 on Venezuela and urged countries to financially disconnect from Maduro\u0027s government.\u0027We\u0027re here to urge all nations to support the democratic aspirations of Venezuelan people as they try to free themselves from former President Maduro\u0027s illegitimate mafia state,\u0027 Pompeo said in his address. Venezuela also defused a potential showdown with the United States, suspending a demand that US diplomats leave the country. Maduro had given U.S. diplomats three days to leave the country, but the Trump administration said it wouldn\u0027t obey, arguing that Maduro is no longer Venezuela\u0027s legitimate president. That set the stage for a showdown at the hilltop U.S. Embassy compound Saturday night, when the deadline was to expire.          Venezuela\u0027s Minister of Foreign Affairs Jorge Arreaza pictured reacting to Pompeo\u0027s fiery speech where he dismissed Maduro\u0027s regime as an \u0027illegitimate mafia state\u0027But as the sun set on Venezuela\u0027s capital, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying Maduro\u0027s government was suspending the expulsion to provide a 30-day window for negotiating with U.S. officials about setting up a \u0027U.S. interests office\u0027 in Venezuela and a similar Venezuelan office in the United States.The State Department did not confirm the Venezuelan government\u0027s account, reiterating only that its priority remains the safety of its personnel and that it has no plans to close the embassy.Earlier on Saturday, Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: \u0027Let me be 100 percent clear - President Trump and I fully expect that our diplomats will continue to receive protections provided under the Vienna Convention.

Bournemouth Swanage Motor Road and Ferry Company was accused by traders of stopping the service after Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling, blocked fare increases But local residents and traders are demanding a public inquiry into the ferry company as they are \u0027not fulfilling their duty to provide a service\u0027.Nick Boulter, chairman of Studland Parish Council, said: \u0027Everyone\u0027s being kept completely in the dark about when the ferry will re-open.\u0027I keep checking their website every day for updates which are not forthcoming - their communication is not good enough.\u0027The ongoing closure is a major inconvenience to commuters who need to use the ferry to get to work and is harming our shops which are missing out on valuable trade. It\u0027s damaging our local economy.\u0027It\u0027s not right that they can\u0027t give us an indication of when they will re-open, and there have been no apologies for the inconvenience.\u0027The situation is outrageous and I believe a public inquiry is necessary to look into why the service has been out of action for so long, which I\u0027ve raised with South Dorset MP Richard Drax.          The ferry has been out of action for 12 weeks meaning a journey that would normally take four minutes by sea, will now be a 40-mile round trip of 90 minutes by road \u0027It may well be that there is a serious problem with the ferry\u0027s hydraulics but at the moment everybody just feels like they didn\u0027t get their fare increase so they are downing tools.\u0027One gallery owner in Swanage said trade in the town had fallen by 40 per cent since the ferry closure, while a cafe owner said she was losing £500 a week.Another business owner, Andy Lees, who runs Studland Stores and Post Office, said: \u0027We rely majorly on visitors and passing traffic to add to our resident local trade.\u0027The ferry being off has a significant impact on our business. Trade falls by 20 per cent with the ferry off which basically means we do not even break even.\u0027Everybody we speak to are totally angry and negative towards the ferry operators.\u0027There is a conspiracy theory that it is a deliberate reaction to the refusal of the ticket price increase.\u0027I don\u0027t subscribe to that theory myself - as it hurts the ferry company as well - but it is a fairly commonly held one.\u0027          Former West Ham and Tottenham manager, Harry Redknapp, has a £4m five-bedroom beachside mansion in Sandbanks that has a swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna and gymZoe Lamble, 36, owner of the Haven Ferry Cafe on Sandbanks, said their business had been down 50 per cent since the ferry closure.She said: \u0027The people using the ferry is a large chunk of our passing trade so we\u0027ve been hit really hard - business is down 50 per cent.\u0027We get no more information from them than the general public and it seems they don\u0027t have a time-frame in mind for when it will re-start.\u0027We order a lot of fresh stock in so it\u0027s a nightmare because we don\u0027t know what trade is going to be like.When he ran me over, it hurt him more than me!

He allegedly plied the girls with drugs and ordered them to sell heroin and crack cocaine – making around ten deals a night.It is claimed the girls were forced to go out on the streets on their own – with dozens of drug wraps stuffed in their bras and mouths and a kitchen knife hidden in a handbag.Jurors heard that when the operation was finally smashed by police Miller swallowed a staggering 78 wraps of drugs before his arrest.Woolwich Crown Court was told that the girls had been locked in a flat and ferried in taxis by Miller and his gang to peddle drugs. The 16-year-olds were given a kitchen knife after being chased by a user in the night in Maidstone, Kent, jurors heard.One of the terrified girls sent a text the next night asking ‘Where am I?’ after allegedly being locked in the flat of a 61-year-old man.Prosecutor Christopher May said Miller faces charges of modern slavery along with three other men – despite only being a youth himself when the alleged offences were committed. He told the court: ‘These two girls were identified by this drug trafficking gang and transported to Maidstone where they ended up being put to work selling drugs.‘The prosecution say that the sending out of these girls to deal in drugs amounts to exploitation in an offence contrary to the Modern Slavery Act.’ Jurors heard the victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were recruited after a chance meeting with Miller, from Ilford, East London, and fellow drug dealer Peace Alaka, 18.Shocking moment \u0027County Lines drug dealer\u0027 drives into a...MI5 has more than 700 spies in Belfast as part of a huge...Share this articleThey were later introduced to the gang’s alleged ringleader, Reis Bhandal, 18. He is said to have controlled a county line – which refers to the mobile phone line used to sell the drugs. The line was nicknamed Walter.Jurors were shown CCTV footage of the girls arriving at an alleged drugs den in Maidstone accompanied by Miller wearing a Chelsea football shirt with his name on the back.Mr May said: ‘They spent the night responding to instructions to go out and deal drugs.’ CCTV showed the pair popping in and out of the flat to make five-minute drugs transactions.But footage later showed the girls running in terror after a 5am drug deal went ‘badly wrong’. They were chased by an angry addict.The girls spent the next day being driven around in a taxi delivering class A drugs, said Mr May. The court was told the victims were taken to the flat of Andrew Cooke, 61, who became their driver.But police became suspicious about a drug deal taking place and stopped Cooke’s car.           Woolwich Crown Court (pictured) was told that the girls had been locked in a flat and ferried in taxis by Miller and his gang to peddle drugsAs they were taken into custody, one of the girls swallowed a bundle of crack cocaine. The other girl was found to have 38 wraps of cocaine and eight wraps of heroin stuffed in her bra and mouth as well as bundles of cash. Days later when police raided Bhandal’s flat, they found Miller hiding in a bedroom where he swallowed drugs wrapped in clingfilm, jurors heard.A total of 78 wraps later passed through his system.The court was told police also found a samurai sword. The SIM card of the phone the county line was based on had been bent in half so no evidence could be retrieved.Mr May said when Miller was asked about the drugs in his body, he angrily told officers: ‘What would you do for your friend if police were knocking and you saw that on a table in front of you?’Miller, Bhandal, Cooke and Alaka deny exploitation and drug charges.

Why don’t you join them?NORTH WESTTown councillor Sue Helliwell, 56, has recruited more volunteers for a pick-up in Alsager, Cheshire. ‘Alsager’s litter is mainly plastic bottles and takeaway cups,’ she says.‘People drink on the hoof and, if there’s not a bin, they’re thrown out of cars. There needs to be more litter bins along routes.’          Dundee-based Shoaib Khan, 37, is a regional youth leader for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association.

We’re a school for children with severe special needs, so going out into the community can be traumatic. But even our most profoundly disabled students really enjoyed it.’          Former teacher Paul Bridgewater has continued to collect litter since the Mail’s Great Plastic Pick UpNORTHCathy Brotherton held a clean-up last year after becoming frustrated at the piles of rubbish left on roads between Dewsbury and Huddersfield.‘The amount of takeaway containers, beer cans and bottles thrown out of car windows on to verges and into fields, which then get smashed, injuring the animals, is unbelievable,’ she says.‘We encourage people to go into the countryside, which always gets neglected.’WEST MIDLANDSChris Dunster, 50, from Olton, near Solihull, says: ‘The Spring Clean enables us to do a targeted approach and collect en masse a whole lot more litter than normal.‘In Solihull, litter-picking is going from strength to strength, so residents are really getting behind it and taking ownership of their local areas. It’s very encouraging.’Alan Preece, senior warden at the Saltwells Local Nature Reserve in Dudley, will be rallying volunteers to take part this year.‘As an urban nature reserve, we do get litter and fly-tipping, ranging from cigarette butts to three-piece suites,’ he says.‘Luckily, we are assisted by two great teams of volunteers who join us to make a difference.’EAST MIDLANDSJanice Cain, a stock controller from Northampton, became an ambassador for Keep Britain Tidy after joining last year’s Great Plastic Pick Up.‘I’m interested in protecting the environment and clearing up plastic,’ says Miss Cain, who this year will be joining The Great British Spring Clean.SCOTLANDDundee-based Shoaib Khan, 37, is a regional youth leader for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association.

I reckon we picked up about ten bags just from the car park.’Art worker Owen Burton, 20, gathered together 12 members of his family to clean an area of Shoeburyness, on the Thames Estuary, last year and he says that he will be joining The Great British Spring Clean campaign this year, too.‘Picking up litter is actually fun!’ he says. ‘I got my family involved as I didn’t want to do it alone.

It’s true that we spoke on the phone, but those communications are political in nature, they’re benign, and  there is certainly no conspiracy with Russia.\u0027Stone, 66, was charged on Friday with lying about his pursuit of Russian-hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton\u0027s 2016 election bid.

Robert Mueller and his team asked for Stone\u0027s indictment to be sealed until he was arrested  Agents wearing body armor and drawing their weapons swarmed Stone\u0027s home in a posh south Florida neighborhood on Friday morning after the indictment was unsealed          Courtroom sketches from Friday morning show Roger Stone in handcuffs as he was led in, and then standing behind a podium next to his lawyer FBI agents clad in bulletproof vests arrived at Stone\u0027s Fort Lauderdale mansion with guns drawn on Friday morning after Mueller unsealed a seven-count indictment from a grand jury impaneled in his sprawling probe of Russian election meddling. Mueller asked a judge Thursday to keep Stone\u0027s indictment sealed until his arrest, arguing that \u0027law enforcement believes that publicity resulting from disclosure will increase the risk of the defendant.The special counsel has been investigating Stone for any communications with Wikileaks during the 2016 campaign. He blasted the FBI for their treatment of him during his arrest in the pre-dawn hours on Friday.\u0027I think the way I was treated on Thursday was extraordinary and I think the American people need to hear about it,\u0027 he told ABC News.\u0027This was an attempt to poison the jury pool,\u0027 he charged. \u0027These are Gestapo tactics.\u0027He noted he would have turned himself in if asked.\u0027They simply could have called my lawyers and I would have turned myself in,\u0027 he said.Stone  appeared in court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Friday morning. He was freed on bond.  Stone emerged from the federal court building flashing a V-for victory with both hands raised, Richard Nixon-style, after appearing in front of a judge Friday afternoon.He addressed scores of reporters outside the court to say: \u0027I am falsely accused\u0027 while protesters around him shouted \u0027lock him up\u0027 and supporters chanted \u0027Roger! Roger!\u0027          Donald Trump, left, has now tried to distance himself from indicted Roger Stone, right, saying he \u0027never even worked for me near the election\u0027          \u0027I will plead not guilty to the charges,\u0027 Stone said, shouting over the protests. \u0027I will defeat them in court. I believe this is a politically motivated investigation.\u0027He added: \u0027There is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies to ease the pressure on myself. I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated.\u0027Wikileaks, shortly before the Democratic National Convention in 2016, posted hacked emails from officials.The emails  revealed how the party was working to secure Hillary Clinton\u0027s nomination over that of primary challenger Bernie Sanders and resulted in then Democratic National Convention Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigning her post. During the presidential campaign, Stone publicly bragged about having \u0027backchannel communications\u0027 with Julian Assange and, in multiple occasions, appeared to predict the WikiLeaks releases.Since then, Stone has walked back those claims.He said his claims were exaggerations based on public information, as well as tips from New York radio host  Randy Credico.In the indictment, Stone is charged with tampering with Credico, including tell him to do a \u0027Frank Pentageli\u0027 in his congressional testimony. Frank Pentageli i a character in the film The Godfather Part II who testified before a congressional committee that he does not know critical information that he does in fact know. Stone said that conversation was a joke between the two men. \u0027Mr. Credico is an impressionist. He does Humphrey Bogart. He does Jack Nicholson. He does Richard Nixon. He does Bill Clinton. The exchange we talked about is Roger Stone this, Roger Stone that. Roger Stone was in the olive oil business with my father but that was a long time ago. It has to be seen in context. It is a humorous exchange,\u0027 he said.\u0027So they’re taking things out of context, present them in a light that it mischaracterized their significance. I never told Mr. Credico to lie. I did - at one point when he said my liberal friends will be very upset, my progressive friends will be upset if they believe I was helping you because they would think I was helping Trump - it was only in that context that the Fifth Amendment protections were discussed,\u0027 he added.Enrique Tarrio: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know | Heavy.comHead of Oregon\u0027s FBI: Bureau doesn\u0027t designate Proud Boys as extremist group | oregonlive.com"},{"url":null,"title":"Lloyds Bank launches mortgage mum dad help young people homeowners","story":"Teaching assistant, 44, reports online lover to police for...What a start to our spring clean!

I felt angry, but also wildly exhilarated. After dreaming for more than 20 years about opening my own chain of booksellers, the moment had finally come.I’d seen enough from my time at WH Smith to know the flaws and gaps in what they were doing. I’d seen their decision to pull back on their bookselling activity to make room for other, unrelated products: videos, music, bottom-of-the-market sandwiches, snacks, chocolate bars, fizzy drinks, cheap plastic toys.I knew there was a niche, a slot, a tantalising gap in the market: a place where books, and the people who read them, and who wrote them, came first. A place for magic to be made. Heaven knows where the money was coming from. But come it would.I bought a dormant company off the shelf, renamed it Waterstones and put into it every single penny I had: £6,000 in redundancy money — in 1982 the equivalent to, say, £18,000 today — and £15,000 I’d borrowed from my father-in-law.On the advice of friends in the know I went to see a bright young Barclays manager in Cranleigh, Surrey, about the possibility of a small business loan. To him I made the most colourfully impassioned presentation of my vision: heavily-stocked, open-all-hours book stores where people could browse at leisure — not buying anything if they chose not to — and be served by specialist staff in a friendly, relaxed environment.Within ten years, I told him, Waterstones would be the biggest bookselling chain in the world outside the U.S. (which, as it turned out, proved to be exactly the case). All I needed was a little temporary help from him in the form of a £100,000 loan.How very interesting, he said, adding that he would be in touch. He never was.Somebody else suggested I went to a certain NatWest manager in Covent Garden, London, and once again I made my impassioned presentation. When I had finished there was dead silence while the bank manager stared at me for a long time.Eventually he told me that I was either a madman or a genius — he couldn’t work out which. But he didn’t mind either way as he was retiring on Tuesday, so I could have the money.With the first tranche of funding in place and four expert staff recruited, we were ready to go. But there was now another unexpected problem to overcome: a number of major publishers refused to supply us, fearing that because of me they would suffer reprisals from WH Smith. I still feel resentment at the memory of that, and remember the stress of wondering whether I would ever get my first store off the ground.But, again, help was at hand. Penguin and Oxford University Press, both key publishers for Waterstones, led the way in getting behind us. Brave souls. One by one other publishers (but not, for a long time, all of them) crept in, too, and our shelves were finally stocked.So . . . the dawning of our very first day. The seven of us — me, plus the four specialists I’d recruited from the prestigious Piccadilly book store Hatchards, along with two other enthusiastic young graduates — flung open the doors of our new shop in Old Brompton Road, Kensington, not far from Harrods.Shortly after nine o’clock the telephone rang. Dane Howell, one of those marvellous new recruits, picked up the receiver.‘Waterstones?’ he purred into it.          Three marriages, a mental breakdown and a VERY lucrative victory over a bitter rival. Concluding the rollicking, page-turning memoir of Britain’s biggest book tycoonYe gods, I thought. He has just said Waterstones. Waterstones! I’ve done it — it’s real! The magic has actually happened!This was more than a little premature, given the bumps and terrors that lay ahead. But at that moment I felt nothing but an immense sense of achievement — a sense that I had finally found happiness and pride, and a resolution to my life.A few minutes later a man bustled in, walked straight over to the reference section, pulled out a copy of the Koran, and took it up to the till. A surprising start to our life.We closed the shop at 10pm I let the staff out, then emptied our solitary till, extracted its tray, and carried it upstairs to the safe. The safe wouldn’t open. I tried the password numerals again, and still it wouldn’t open.It was too late to call the people who had installed it, so I stuffed the money into a Waterstones bag and made for the Underground station. I fell asleep on the train, then woke up a few minutes later at my stop and jumped out.I jumped out rather too hastily, as it happened. A friend rang me in the morning to ask how the first day had gone.‘Good news and bad news,’ I said.‘What’s the good news?’‘We took over £1,000,’ I said.‘That’s wonderful! Well done! So what’s the bad news, then?’‘I left it on the train . . . ’HMV sells book shop chain Waterstone\u0027s to Russian...HMV on the brink: Troubled retailer is given two months to...Women writers at war over fake book reviews on AmazonTycoon behind Waterstones bookshop reveals in searing new...Share this articleIt is my suspicion that most entrepreneurs are driven by an inability to forgive or forget. As I explained on Saturday, I have no doubt that was the case with me. Possibly the main driver of my whole life so far had been the beyond-painful failure of my relationship with my father. It served to generate an energy in the birth of Waterstones that was just a little insane. And an insane, disruptive foe is tough for corporate rivals to measure up to — as events were to prove.I wish my father had lived long enough to see Waterstones brought to life. But to my regret he had died five or six years beforehand — around ten years after my much-loved mother. Shortly before his death, however, I’d had a surprising call from him, suggesting that we meet that day for a picnic.I hadn’t seen him for some years, and I don’t think he had telephoned me before ever — and I mean ever — except for a few times in the final years of his life when he had run out of money and needed from me what he called ‘a small loan’.I should mention in passing that none of these loans was ever repaid. And that when my father died I found that I, alone, of his three children had been left out of his will.But the call on this occasion was not a request for money. It seemed to be, and I am sure it was, a reaching out to me. An attempt to build something between us at last. So we had the picnic, me with my then wife Claire and our two baby daughters, he with his pleasant second wife, an Australian widow.We sat beside each other on the rug. In time, Claire took the children off to play. My father and I talked. Yes — talked. And — yes — he was trying to reach out to me. He really was. And I to him.That was the last time I saw him alive. He couldn’t have known that he was so near to the day of his death. The aneurism that killed him instantaneously just a very few days later could not have been foretold. After I’d heard the news I sat on a chair beside the mortuary slab and gazed at my father. The covering lay loose on his body, and I leant across him to straighten it.It may seem uncomfortably offhand for me to say this, but the truth was that he had never loved me, and I had never loved him. I would have liked to have loved my father, and perhaps he would have liked to have loved me, too, his son. Who knows?I took my father’s hand, and held it for a moment. But it felt wrong, and contrived, and I didn’t welcome the intimacy of it, so I let the hand go, and just stared at him.He was dead. He was gone. I was free of him.MY father had for some years lived and worked in India, so perhaps it was not surprising that in my early 20s I decided to go there myself. I had always wanted to travel and, with no other clear plan in mind, I hoped it would be an adventure.It was during my time there that I got married for the first time. We were extremely young: I was only 23 and Tricia, my wife, had just turned 20. She had come out from England to join me, and we had three perfect children together, all in quite rapid succession.Tricia was delightful, but in just a few years we broke up, and it is best for all of us if I keep the statement as plain and unvarnished as that.Four years after we broke up, I married again. Claire was 25 and she, too, was delightful. Again, we had three perfect children. Again, in time, we broke up. And, again, it is best for all of us if I keep the statement as plain and unvarnished as that.Unconnected with all this — or was it? — a year or so into the period between the two marriages I’d had the biggest depressive breakdown of all time — or so it seemed to me. It happened quite suddenly, and I have no recollection as to what the trigger of it was, or if indeed there was one.I just know that I felt as though I was attempting to lift myself out of a dark, dark melancholy that had served to wholly flatten me.

Her most famous images – Chicken Knickers, in which she attached an oven-ready bird, cavity gaping, to her crotch, or Self-Portrait with Fried Eggs, where a pair of the latter lay on her T-shirted chest, below the ultimate “what you looking at? stare – asked blunt questions about the objectification of women, and the predictable appetite of the male gaze.Others, like this one, the first of three pictures entitled Got a Salmon On played with cliches of masculine prowess, to pointed comic effect. Lucas hoists the fat fish on her shoulder like a floppy rifle. She’s outside the barred-up gents in her oversized double-breasted pinstripe jacket and spit-and-polished boots. The title of the picture echoes a sexual boast, hints at a female equivalent, and captures some of the absurdity of such phrasing. Unusually, for Lucas, her eyes fix not on us but down on the salmon she stands awkwardly, likably, trying to get a proper grip of the big fish and her slippery metaphors (by number three in the series, she has got the fish in place and stands, dark-eyed, to attention by the wall).The picture is included in an exhibition featuring more than a century of British women photographers subtitled A History of British Trailblazers. Lucas lines up alongside pioneers such as Julia Margaret Cameron and Lee Miller, as well as fellow former YBAs Sam Taylor-Wood and Gillian Wearing. Others more than match her technical gifts, but Lucas’s swagger and confrontation is a defining spirit.Women in Photography: A History of British Trailblazers opens on 30 Jan and runs until 2 June, The Lightbox, Woking"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

Not, perhaps, an unusual sentiment to find expressed in the . But, as a centre-right columnist, I do not start from the proposition that all Tories are inherently evil champions of “neoliberalism” (whatever that means), intent on maximising suffering and despair. I don’t express this contempt for the party blithely or to prove a point. This is not an exercise in rhetoric. I mean it.By way of explanation: I used to edit the Spectator. I am proud to chair a centre-right thinktank, Bright Blue. I wrote a book about the Conservative-led coalition. And if you think that’s bad, I was one of the few people in the world who applauded aspects of Theresa May’s 2017 manifesto (that’s a really select club).True, I have never been a Conservative member – on the whole, I don’t think journalists should join parties, though many excellent ones do so. But, as a believer in fiscal discipline, strong defence, robust anti-terrorism measures, the Atlantic alliance and the social liberalism of those who live in the here and now, I ought to be at ease with modern Conservatism. And I really am not. Brexit has tested that broad affinity to destruction – and in this respect I know that I speak for many on the centre-right.Yes, Jeremy Corbyn’s vacillation has been pathetic. But he is the leader of the opposition. It was a Conservative government that called the referendum, and a Conservative prime minister who – having squandered her party’s majority in the 2017 general election – bought the support of the Democratic Unionist party with taxpayers’ money so she could stay in power and finish the job. Brexit is a Tory gig.And it has brought out the very, very worst in the party. The attack on “Teutonic arrogance” by Mark Francois MP – in response to the warning by Airbus boss Tom Enders of the consequences of a no-deal withdrawal – would be easy to dismiss were it not the tip of a nativist iceberg.Brexit has summoned the very worst demons that lurk in the Conservative psyche, liberating Tories to bellow nonsense about the second world war, the blitz spirit and pseudo-Churchillian defiance. It has fatally compounded the party’s demented fixation with immigration and distracted it from the true challenges of the 21st century.Parliament used to be the crucible of the Conservative ethos: the place where history met contemporary discourse. Now, we have MP Jacob Rees-Mogg – a man still spoken of by supposedly serious colleagues as a leadership contender – urging Theresa May to suspend the legislature if it seeks to thwart a no-deal Brexit.In the cabinet, we have the trade secretary, Liam Fox, saying that government can be the servant of the people or the servant of parliament, but it cannot be both. A chilling populism is now creeping into the language of mainstream Toryism: the language of treachery, snarling tribalism and impatience with anything that smacks of prudence, compromise or caution. In the Conservative stockade, emotion has toppled fact.This, in the end, is the unforgivable act of intellectual surrender. By tradition, the strongest claim the Tories have had to office is a belief that ideology should be subordinated to reality. Even Margaret Thatcher – the most explicitly ideological of Conservative prime ministers – was ousted to stop the poll tax and to salvage Britain’s relations with Europe.As Michael Portillo put it a few months after he had lost his seat in 1997: “It is extremely important for the Conservative party to deal with the world as it now is.” This was the animating idea behind what became Tory modernisation and the basis of David Cameron’s leadership campaign in 2005: the notion that a centre-right party should, on principle, celebrate the ersity of contemporary life and the plurality of modern society. Alas, that project – which reached its high point in Cameron’s legislation for marriage equality in 2013 – now lies in ashes.The whole point of Conservatism is not to submit to the siren call of teleology: the belief that history has an implacable direction. In a crisis of this nature, the proper role of Tories should be to cut through the infantile rhetoric, robotic platitudes and Vogon insistence that “resistance is useless!”, and show true statesmanship. Instead, we see – with some outstanding exceptions – a party cravenly fetishising the 2016 referendum as if no further expression of popular opinion on Brexit were possible behaving as if the only thing that matters is to get out of the EU by 29 March, regardless of the overwhelming empirical evidence that there is no viable deal, and that a no-deal exit would be a total catastrophe (necessitating, among many other unpleasant measures, a framework for martial law).Look at them all: fiddling with the backstop while the treaty of Rome burns (or at least the page that bears Edward Heath’s signature). It is uniquely dispiriting to see intelligent Conservatives cheerleading or appeasing this drive towards disaster.Politicians always tell me that the demands of the life are worth it because of the agency you get to exercise. Well, where is that agency right now? Where are the Tories prepared to risk their careers and to say that the instruction given by the electorate in 2016 cannot be delivered in a way that does not do terrible harm to those same voters and their children?To be clear: I haven’t undergone a conversion. My values have not changed. But the Conservative party is morphing into something I find alien and repellent. Like a listing galleon, holed below the waterline, it sails away stubbornly dragging the nation towards a storm of unknown adversity, peril and pain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdf59fd6d1ed4f42b028b622ce4c47db01b7a3ea/0_252_3781_2269/master/3781.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=869ec0085516ffcddff4e3edf03fb8f9","title":"anna wintour is coming we find out who we are when we dress for lunch with the vogue editor","story":"Does she really care what I wear?It was 20 December when I received an invitation out of the blue.Would I like to attend lunch with Anna Wintour? If so please save the date and a formal invitation will follow.After the bewilderment (why me?) came joy (lunch! With Anna Wintour! At the tennis!). Then came the anxiety.What would I wear? I had nothing to wear! What the fuck would I wear?Wintour, editor-in-chief of Vogue, has passed into legend. She has been mythologised in books and movies, had an award-winning documentary made about her (The September Issue), and has more influence on what we wear on a daily basis than anyone else.As the lunch drew nearer, questions about what to wear overcame any thoughts of the event itself. Or even the woman herself. I didn’t know if there would be a small selection of guests or large. I didn’t know if I’d be actually talking to Wintour or was expected to interview her. I didn’t know how I was going to get there (the lunch was in Melbourne, I was in Sydney) or even why I was invited.She doesn’t like all black, counselled one friend. She hates clothes to be wrinkled, so you have to wear something freshly ironed, said another. At the hairdresser, the woman at the next basin, who had once been in the same room as Wintour (an experience she described as “terrifying”) advised sotto voce to “Wear sunglasses. Everyone around her wears sunglasses.”Others suggested I just wear the most fashionable thing I own.Fair enough, but the most on-trend piece in my wardrobe is the Big Puffer and it was going to be 41C in heatwave-afflicted Melbourne.Apart from an upcoming court appearance (another wardrobe dilemma!), what I would wear was the thing I thought about most frequently, and also caused me the most stress in the weeks between 20 December and 24 January.When it comes to Anna Wintour, there exists a warped relationship between her and the public. It is not about what she is wearing (as it would be with normal celebrities), but what am I wearing when I am seeing her (her, the ultimate global arbiter of what we all wear).An invitation to lunch with her then becomes mostly an experience to be disseminated through the following lens: what did you wear when you went to lunch with Anna Wintour?The experience with Wintour has already been related to your friends perhaps weeks before the event itself. You might have Instagrammed a selfie wearing the chosen outfit before you have even gone to the lunch. It is over before it has even begun. The encounter is complete without in the conventional sense, ever having occurred.Wintour has gone beyond the usual questions you get when you meet a celebrity of “what is she like?” to the more meta “what are you like (or ‘how do you present’) when you are in a room with her”. She (the abstract she, because she is not real or human in this exchange) becomes a story that you tell others about yourself. The story is what you wore the day you had lunch with Anna Wintour.The mirror that she provides helps create and possibly endorse your identity (an identity that speaks through clothes).Zadie Smith did a very good essay on Justin Bieber about how he is denied personhood because he is the object of such intense projection among fans.This is the problem not just with meeting famous people, but people who exist in our imagination in a state of perfection.Wintour’s state of perfection is in the area of clothes. For decades she has edited the most influential fashion magazine in the world. She exists then at the top of a hierarchy. It is a very human instinct to want to establish a hierarchy and create order. If you want to find out how good you are, you need to find a representation of perfection upon which to measure yourself. Wintour through the pop culture myth that surrounds her, and the fact that she edits Vogue, is the collective symbol of sartorial perfection.So the lunch came around and I walked in, still not sure what to expect.There was a giant screen with Wintour’s face on it and at least 400 people in the function room, drinking green juice or champagne or ordering flat whites from the coffee station or talking selfies on a small piece of red carpet in front of an Australian Open trademarked backdrop.We were all having lunch with Anna Wintour. Yet none of us were.My relief at the lack of intimacy was immense. You see, I was unhappy with my outfit and I did not want to be seen.The day was filthy hot and most people there were dressed neatly, the men in nondescript light suits, the women in cotton or linen sundresses.No one – literally no one – not Baz Luhrmann, not Julie Bishop, looked as if they’d stepped off the catwalk. People looked off-the-rack normal, unmemorable, fine.But yet, somewhere, even in this clothes-limiting heat, Wintour does actually serve her totemic purpose.She showed me who I am through the clothes that I ended up wearing.We find out who we are under moments of stress and panic. We find out who we are when we dress for lunch with Anna Wintour.I found out this week I am a generic, mid-priced brand in an airport, that markets office clothes for women aged age 20 to 55."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4516f5a9391f39b20ed8c27b69dee562d2b61d44/0_3_5126_3075/master/5126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26de962ac8279a94ab85824c36df2335","title":"england brexit caricature modern diverse","story":"It’s time we started building a new England – one that is modern, erse and openThere are two kinds of questions to be asked about Brexit. One of them defines the day-to-day grind at Westminster, and is about an urgent set of issues that encompasses everything from the most basic framework for trade to the future of Northern Ireland, and which still seem all but insoluble. But as all the parliamentary drama on goes on, it is the other big Brexit conundrum that shows even fewer signs of resolution. To use a phrase habitually deployed by the prime minister herself, what kind of country do we want to be? Put another way, who are we?To some extent we know the answer, and it is not pretty. Whatever the varied motivations of many of the people who voted for it, our exit from the European Union looks to outsiders like an expression of nostalgia, introversion and a very unbecoming belligerence. Some of the most powerful branches of government seem to be operating on much the same impulses. As evidenced by the Windrush scandal and a steady stream of heartbreaking deportation stories, the Home Office now seems to be institutionally sociopathic. So does the Department for Work and Pensions.Of the countries that make up the United Kingdom, England has come to be understood as a country awash with furies and resentments. Politicians have seen that a significant part of its population apparently thinks that immigration is inherently problematic and ought to be the focus of endless crackdowns, and that supposed benefit “cheats” deserve the same treatment. In turn, the Tories – and, it has to be said, elements of the pre-Corbyn Labour party – have only encouraged the same prejudices and misapprehensions, so the public gets what the public wants, even when it ruins the lives of many of the public themselves. The central tragedy of Brexit, perhaps, is that it represents such crabby, self-harming attitudes being applied to the fundamentals of economics, trade, and Britain’s place in the world.When I am out reporting, it usually seems that most of us remain essentially mild, moderate people, seemingly open to compromise. But everyday examples of the worst of the Brexit spirit are easy to find. Last week, I visited the offices of a successful language-learning app in central London, and talked to staff who had moved to the UK from across Europe, and who had recently started to experience a mixture of discomfort and estrangement. The Austrian chief executive told me that he had been upbraided by a complete stranger for speaking his native language: “I was talking in German on the phone, and an old lady, very well-dressed, came up to me and said, ‘Speak fucking English’.”We all know what sits behind such small horrors. The belief that millions of people come to this country to swing the lead and somehow milk the system is a commonplace. There are benign manifestations of England and Englishness, but in certain people’s mouths those words express whiteness, a defiant rejection of the outside world and the cities that have opened themselves to it. Some still believe that their country needs to rediscover its imperial supremacy, stand apart from Europe, and stick it to the rest of the world. There are hardened versions of these views on the outer edges of the political spectrum, and vaguer echoes that blur out into the mainstream. But they are real, and they are at the heart of where we have arrived.On the left, there is an age-old tendency to hear people talk about things that stray into questions of culture and identity, and automatically reduce them to matters of economics and inequality. In this view, people might complain about immigration but what they are really brassed off about is the housing crisis when they talk longingly about the past they are essentially bemoaning the demise of manufacturing. As a recent speech by Jeremy Corbyn put it, the only ide that supposedly matters is that “between the many – who do the work, who create the wealth and pay their taxes, and the few – who set the rules, who reap the rewards and so often dodge taxes”. To the extent that England’s malaise is tangled up with a serious shortage of homes, deindustralistion, and our country’s awful imbalances of power and wealth, this is hardly unreasonable. Indeed, I have seen plenty of evidence of the deep connection between the two, and regularly arrived at the same conclusion.There again, why do much the same Brexit-ish instincts and opinions run so deep among affluent people with no obvious axe to grind? What students of Marxism would call economic determinism has its place, but it risks constant denial of the fact that politics has long since slipped free of the old simplicities of class and economic complaint. Culture matters. The political right understood this a long time ago, selling a brand of Englishness replete with the reactionary instincts that exploded in June 2016. In his brilliant Brexit book The Lure of Greatness, the writer and activist Anthony Barnett makes a point that people on the left ought to think deeply about: “One reason the right won such dramatic successes in 2016 in England is that their opponents on the left fled the field of meaning and identity.”Five years ago I watched a grassroots movement in Scotland lead a conversation about leaving the UK behind, and moving on from an old, patriarchal, hidebound view of their own country. People I met had developed a kind of progressive politics that could deal with the two key challenges of modernity – identity and belonging on one side, and equality and redistribution on the other – and incorporate them into a vision of a forward-looking, open country. The Scottish independence movement had its nasty elements, not least online. But after long years of groundwork, the conversation about a new Scotland had been updated by a coalition of organisations that stood well apart from party politics, known at the time as “the third Scotland”, because of its distance from both the SNP and the Labour party.Coming back home feeling both envious and excited, I wondered if my country could give rise to anything similar. I know, I know: England might be too big, weighed down by its history, and now fatally wounded by its deep isions. Even though it has its own health service and education system, and an array of problems that originate in the broken way it is governed, almost no politicians on the left will talk about it. But 55 million of us live in that country, and if we believe it should finally embrace the values of ersity and acceptance and an open and connected world, we are going to have to make that case.As against imperial delusions and English exceptionalism, it is time we talked about the realities of our past and a future that necessarily involves being part of Europe – and the fact that in the 21st century, the movement of people is a basic fact of life. I know what a modern, open, accepting, erse vision of my country looks like: I see it not just in Bristol, Manchester, Leicester, Leeds, and Birmingham, but in endless small kindnesses in places that are too often either ignored or reduced to a Brexit-supporting caricature. We need to seize on such examples and make the case for a new England. When do we start?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce25dac8d5b94aee90ba4dd788e6e719e9996781/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29fe298c1223f0fe3a3b3910486c6389","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of sweet","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘sweet’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘sweet’.Share your photos of what sweet means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 30 January at 10am.

Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

Now she’s in a brutal sex-trafficking drama and speaking out about skin lightening and shortsighted directorsFreida Pinto’s role in her new film Love Sonia is shocking. She plays a desperate sex worker in a brutal tale of trafficking. Rashmi is complex, edgy and selfish – everything you wouldn’t expect of a Pinto character. After all, the Indian actor, who made her name in Danny Boyle’s phenomenally successful Slumdog Millionaire, has spent much of her career playing eye candy. And she is sick of it.Love Sonia is relentless. A debt-ridden father sells his teenage daughter Preeti to a landlord, who then trafficks her to a brothel in Mumbai. Her sister Sonia, brilliantly played by newcomer Mrunal Thakur, goes in search of her, and is also ensnared in the trafficking web. She is anally raped to preserve her value as a virgin. Having lost her virginity, she is stitched so she can once again be sold as untouched. Just when you think things can’t get worse, they do.Pinto’s older sex worker appears to befriend Sonia, but ultimately betrays her to protect herself. This is a world without love or loyalty and reflects a stark reality. Last year, India was named the most dangerous country for women in terms of human trafficking, by a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey of 550 experts on women’s issues. Love Sonia has been 10 years in the making. Pinto was first shown an early version of the script by director Tabrez Noorani the day after she finished shooting Slumdog Millionaire. Noorani, a line producer on Slumdog Millionaire, wrote Love Sonia after helping to rescue trafficked women from brothels. But it took another decade to finesse the script, get financial backing and find the right Sonia.After Slumdog Millionaire, in which Pinto played Latika, a street kid described as “the most beautiful girl in the world”, she was keen for a more demanding role. But in hindsight, she says she wasn’t ready for Love Sonia. She was too unworldly. “I thought it was exaggerated when I read the script. I couldn’t believe what I was reading.” Later, when she met trafficked sex workers advising on the film, she began to think that, if anything, the story had been understated. She winces when she recalls a question she asked one of them. “I said: ‘Hypothetically speaking, if you had a chance to leave this world, let’s say you fell in love and found somebody who’d treat you right for once, would you escape?’ And she said to me: ‘Madam, love only exists in your world. In my world, there is just betrayal.’”The trajectory of Pinto’s career in the years after Slumdog certainly didn’t suggest she would ever make a hard-hitting film about sex trafficking. Time after time, she played the vapid love interest, characters so underwritten that they struggled to be one-dimensional. So in Woody Allen’s You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, Josh Brolin’s author, Roy, spends his time staring longingly out of the window at Pinto’s Dia in the flat opposite. When he confesses this to her, she says: “I’ve always wanted to be someone’s muse.” In Terence Mallick’s Knight of Cups, she is a pouting femme fatale who states: “I don’t want to wreak havoc in men’s lives any more.” In Miral, directed by Julian Schnabel, she plays a Palestinian heroine whose boyfriend tells her she has “beautiful eyes”, while an Israeli interrogator tells her: “You have a beautiful face … you won’t recognise it when you get out of here.” Some of the world’s best-known directors have been so fixated on her looks that they forgot to create a character for her. “They couldn’t go past what they saw on the outside,” Pinto says. “And that’s their problem, not mine, right, because I know what I can bring to the table as talent.”It has been a strange, decade-long career, including an unexplained extended break. Meanwhile, off-screen she has been an assertive force for good, consistently campaigning for the rights of women. Does she see a contradiction between her feminism and the films she has made? “Completely! There was no way I agreed with so much that I did in my early career.” Pinto takes me through some of her experiences, with jaw-dropping honesty. She loved working with Brolin on the Allen film (“Josh taught me to relax because I would get really worked up before each take – I was too nervous to breathe and my body would stiffen”), but has nothing positive to say of her part. “I was just the muse, the ingenue.” Would she work again with Allen, who has been accused by his daughter Dylan of sexual assault (an allegation he denies)? “No. Absolutely not. I wouldn’t work with him because I’m in solidarity with women who have come out with their stories, whether they are proven or not. I’m just going to stick to what my gut instinct tells me. I’m 34 years old, I’ve worked for 11 years in this industry, I’m not desperate and I will never be desperate.”Then it is on to another unhappy experience, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, made in 2011. Pinto was looking forward to playing a smart, independent-minded primatologist. But it didn’t work out that way. “I felt completely undermined as the only female perfomer in the film who wasn’t given a task other than to be a primatologist in frickin’ high heels and follow the men around. Have you seen Jane Goodall wearing high heels and running on the Golden Gate Bridge? I don’t think so. I spoke to one of the producers and asked why I was put in high heels because it didn’t make sense for my character – if she was so hands-on with animals, she needed freedom of movement and her body language needed to be different. I wish I’d been more confident in putting my case forward back then, but I remember asking him what his reference was and I was told Megan Fox from Transformers and I was like – that is a completely different film.” Again, she doesn’t write off the experience – she got to work with some of her favourite actors, including Andy Serkis and John Lithgow – but she does write off her role in the film.Pinto is not finished yet. Now we are on to Black Gold, a historical epic about the scramble for oil in the Arabian desert in the 1920s. “In Black Gold, what was I? Like a princess who had no say, who was just in love … I can’t even remember the story, that’s how bad it is.” And she is really trying hard to remember her character now. “Oh my God! What was my role? I have no frickin clue! Oh my God, that’s terrible.” In 30 years of interviewing, I have never heard somebody trash their career so comprehensively – or honestly.Pinto is on a brief visit to Britain from Los Angeles, where she now lives, to promote Love Sonia. We meet at the central London hotel where she is staying. She arrives quietly, orders a camomile tea and gets on with it. Pinto is, of course, gorgeous slightly built, but strong-looking. She is also bright, intense and combative. In her tracksuit top and bottoms and surprisingly large trainers (size eight and a half), she resembles a Hollywood action hero. Her accent is a weird global confection – cut-glass English, Indian, American, with an upward Aussie inflection. She says people tell her she sounds South African.Pinto was born in Mumbai (then still Bombay) to Mangalorean Catholics – her mother was a school principal, her father a bank manager. She went to convent school and was a confident, outspoken girl. She says she soon felt stymied by the dogma of the church. “I was 13 or 14 when I heard a priest talk about homosexuality in a sermon. He asked us to pray for them through this illness, this sickness, what they’re going through, hoping that they would come out the other side, finding the answer in Jesus. After mass, I questioned him. I said: ‘What makes you think it’s an illness?’”Her parents worried that she was too opinionated, and she admits at times she was. “I was very candid a bit too honest. When I was six or seven years old, there was this young boy, probably about 16, who sang a Christmas carol during Sunday mass, and he was terrible. He came over to wish the family happy Christmas and I said: ‘Hey, you sang terribly at mass today, you shouldn’t sing.’ And my mum was like: ‘Oh my God, I’m so embarrassed, I’m so sorry that my daughter is so rude.’” Would she do that now? “Of course not because I’ve been told not to do it, or I’ll find a better way of putting it, but I was a bit too blunt as a child, and that was terrible. I hurt the poor boy’s feelings.” How did he react? “Apparently he was very upset. My mum told me he never sang again after that.”She studied English literature, and after graduating in 2005 went into modelling. Two years later, she was cast in Slumdog Millionaire, despite having no acting experience. The film won eight Oscars, including best picture and director. She and her co-star, British actor Dev Patel, were suddenly world famous. Everybody wanted a share of their fairytale – they became a couple in real life, and were together for six years. Pinto found herself in demand across the world – not just as an actor, but also to flog products. In 2009, she signed a lucrative contract to became the face of L’Oréal.Life really was amazing. “I was riding the waves and going to all the fashion weeks on the front row. And travelling first class, and holidays and blah blah blah. And every director I wanted to meet wanted to meet me too.”And then they offered her parts. And time after time they disappointed. For the first time in her life, she lost confidence. Did she feel exposed because she hadn’t trained as an actor? “Yes, I felt like people around me knew more how to do things. All I had was instinct. I lost the innocence that comes with confidence. The blind faith. Spontaneity.”Even the films she was proud of prompted uncomfortable questions – in Michael Winterbottom’s Trishna, based on Tess of the D’urbervilles, she wanted to know why she had to be so passive. When she was cast as the eponymous Palestinian heroine of Miral, she wondered why. “I worried that I wasn’t Arab enough to play the role, so how were they going to convince the audience?” Again, she stresses the positives – Schnabel treated her with respect and she learned about the politics of the Middle East. In Desert Dancer, she was cast as an Iranian, and again asked why. But she knew the answer really. “It’s the same reason Ridley Scott was questioned on why they had non-Egyptian actors playing Egyptian roles in Gods of Egypt. To get the film financed and sold, they came to the person they thought was closest to that culture. Having said that, Iran and India have nothing in common. We’re two different parts of the world.”Did she ever think of sticking two fingers up at the film industry and walking way? “Yeah, I did. And it cost me two and a half years. I didn’t work for two and a half years.” At 28, she says, she had an existential crisis. “I thought: is this something I really want to do, or am I just doing it because I got this amazing start to my career and now this is all I know how to do?”So she waited for a good job to come along. And waited. “I didn’t know if I’d ever get a job again because out of sight could be so out of mind.” Was she offered lots of roles? “Yes, but – trust me – they were not worth my time.” Does she regret turning any of them down? “No. The films were big, but the roles were not good enough to regret.”I ask if she ever struggled for money. “No, no. That was the saving grace. I had a lucrative brand endorsement deal – a seven-year contract that kept me afloat. I’m grateful to L’Oréal for ever.” In 2011, her L’Oréal contract came under scrutiny when it was suggested that the company had lightened her skin in a campaign. Had they Photoshopped the image? L’Oréal denies altering her skin tone but she says: “I’m sure they did, because that’s not the colour of my skin you saw in a few of the campaigns.” Did she complain? “I said to my agent after the first controversy that I would like to see the pictures before, and I would like to be able to question them on colour correction.” She also insisted on having a clause written into her contract. “All the brands, including L’Oréal, have a skin-lightening range that they sell in India and I made them put it in my contract that I would not touch that with a barge pole. If you don’t put it in your contract before you sign on, they can come and you will be compelled to do it.” After she protested about the skin-lightening, she says, it never happened again. (L’Oréal has been approached for a comment.) Pinto has lived in Los Angeles for nine years, and says she feels at home there her boyfriend, adventure photographer Cory Tran, is also LA-based. She often spends time in Mumbai, where her parents and sister still live.In 2017, she returned to the screen with Guerrilla, a TV drama about Britain’s black power movement. Pinto’s underground activist Jas Mitra was a formidable character, leading from the front. She says this was the start of her reinvention as an actor. At one point Jas says to one of the men in her life: “The first chance you get, you reduce me to my looks.” I tell her it feels personal – that it could be aimed at directors such as Allen or Mallick. “Yep!” she says, with a broad smile. She says that bit of dialogue was the result of a conversation she had with Guerrilla director John Ridley. “I talked to John about looks and how they hold people back and I told him how crazy it is to be a little fed up to be told you’re beautiful. I know I sound ungrateful, but I’m not. I’m very grateful for what I have, but I’m fed up of hearing other people tell me that or remind me of that.”As for now, Pinto could not be happier that nobody is likely to come out of Love Sonia discussing her looks. On its release in India, the film was not been warmly received. “People haven’t welcomed a film that exposes the underbelly of the country. It hasn’t done well.” But she says she is not going to judge the film’s success by its box-office takings – highlighting the trafficking scandal is far more important.In many ways, Pinto is just starting out as an actor – and still has much to prove. But despite everything she has said today, she insists there is nothing she would change. If she hadn’t done all the naff work, she says, she wouldn’t be where she is now – and it’s great to have got her existential crisis out of the way. “I’m glad the reality check happened. Now I think I can finally say I’ve figured things out for myself.”Love Sonia is on general release"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f3cc91512ce04e14d6b025d2c1910d7bc1f65f6/0_120_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a221bac7292688d1b9540570aad3843f","title":"them that follow review olivia colman cant save dull snake handling drama","story":"A committed performance from the recent Oscar nominee is one of the few highlights of a lethargic, emotionally vacant film about a Pentecostal communityThere are two skilled performers making the best of their underwritten roles in Them That Follow, a rather dull slab of Appalachian dirge premiering at this year’s Sundance film festival. One is the never not welcome Olivia Colman, fresh off receiving her first Oscar nomination for The Favourite. The other is a snake.Both are ferociously committed, even terrifying at times, and both deserve far more than this frustratingly vacant attempt to provide insight into a specific community, rarely seen on screen. We’re in the world of Pentecostal snake-handlers, deep in the wilderness, and a congregation led by pastor Lemuel (Walter Goggins, on autopilot). His daughter Mara (Alice Englert) is being prepped for marriage to a local boy, whom she has little interest in, while she tries to limit her affection for the non-believing son of gas station attendant Hope (Colman). Mara has a secret that weighs heavy and threatens to destroy the lives of those around her.There’s an initial curiosity with Them That Follow, an intrigue at what we might discover and learn when spending 98 minutes in a world most of us know very little about. But not long into writer-directors Britt Poulton and Dan Madison Savage’s first feature, interest starts to dissipate. It’s a torturous slow-burn that expects us to invest in a lead character of profound emptiness who finds herself in a soapy scenario that plays out with little panache or ingenuity. Englert is a hologram of a character, stuck in a cycle of ponderous sub-Malickian scenes of staring at nature that don’t even possess the aesthetic appeal to make them visually interesting, requiring a great deal of patience from even the most patient of viewers.Her forbidden affair, which the film later prioritises and romanticises, is inert, constructed in about two abruptly handled scenes, one of which is conducted with such open stupidity that it leads to a predictably staged confrontation with Colman’s impassioned believer. But even when she’s given very little, Colman makes the most. She struggles with an American accent but she adds fire to whatever scene she crops up in, elevating the film around her with conviction and ferocity. While her performance in The Favourite has been deservedly lauded for its comic appeal, it’s also an underrated dramatic turn and here Colman reminds us of that particular set of skills, harking back to her game-changing turn in Tyrannosaur.And then there’s those snakes. With the film rumbling on at such a low level, a sequence involving a snake bite and the resulting fallout does prove involving although acts as the impetus for a sudden lurch into melodrama. There’s such a confounding lack of atmosphere or tension throughout that when the pulpy stuff arrives, it lands with a thud. There were walkouts here before one act of brutality but given how detached and lethargic the plot had been up until then, the decision to leave was entirely understandable.Poulton and Savage ultimately show very little interest in delving into the community they’ve chosen to depict. It would be kind to call the script’s characterisation slight, more realistic to refer to it as non-existent while third act learnings are identical to any other film about an extremist religious faction. It’s very hard to imagine Them That Follow existing outside of its lo-fi Sundance bubble. It’s competently made but utterly vacant, a forgettable indie fading fast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cd7a8ffd6fef50d85ca4ab8cd7f56a35b03e627/0_165_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8172d6a6bd45f863f45db324e1a61874","title":"the souvenir review joanna hogg honor swinton byrne","story":"Joanna Hogg’s disconcerting drama, unveiled at Sundance, challenges insecure film student Honor Swinton Byrne to navigate the murky depths of class and privilegeJoanna Hogg’s new movie The Souvenir is refrigerated and mysterious: uncompromising, uningratiating: an artefact in the highest auteur register, but a film that creeps up on you – from behind. There’s a challenging absence of obvious readability, particularly with regard to the vital issue of tone. In some ways, it’s like a psychological drama without the drama or an ironic satire without the irony – or not much irony anyway. (Perhaps the nearest thing to playfulness is the deadpan announcement over the closing credits that The Souvenir II is on its way — the way they used to trail the upcoming James Bond.)As with other Hogg films, there is an austere, unemphasised plainness. Closeups are rare. Hogg conducts her dramatic business in a sort of indoor available light, with characters often quite simply going into semi-darkness if they walk away from windows: a look Hogg has contrived in her other films, no matter what cinematographer she is working with. Most distinctively, it is a film about the upper classes, but not in the Downton Abbey style: it is about the upper classes as they actually are, in the dull day-to-day, a social realist movie about posh people. It’s as if Hogg has found a contemporary English response to the rhetoric of Antonioni or Visconti.The setting is the early 80s, and a sweet-natured young film student called Julie – keen on her documentary proposal about working-class communities in Sunderland – lives in a smart flat in London’s Knightsbridge, just across from the cupola of Harrods department store. This is evidently a pied-à-terre kept by her extremely grand parents who have a country place in north Norfolk. Her mother sometimes pops in after shopping expeditions, and is always having to “lend” Julie money for her film projects.Julie is living here with bohemian flatmates, and at boozy, smoky parties the conversation sometimes strays to the subject of Julie’s privilege, though in a tolerant vein. But then these friends head off on their travels, leaving her alone in the flat. It is at this stage that the vampirish figure of Anthony makes his appearance: a supercilious, opinionated young man with a chalkstripe suit and a junior position at the Foreign Office. He has an insidious knack of playing on Julie’s insecurities, by asking pointedly sceptical, quizzical questions about her work and airily claiming to admire Powell and Pressburger. His seduction technique involves taking her to the Wallace Collection to see Fragonard’s painting The Souvenir. It isn’t long before this sinister, parasitical figure has moved in, buying Julie erotic lingerie, taking her to Venice, disrupting her film-making plans and upending her life.In another sort of movie, this would be a black comedy, and it feels like the plot for something by Nancy Mitford, or an early AN Wilson novel such as Wise Virgin or The Sweets of Pimlico. But comedy isn’t what’s happening. Yet what is happening?The casting is a challenge: Anthony is played with underplayed arrogance by Tom Burke, and newcomer Honor Swinton Byrne gives a rather graceful and insouciant performance as Julie. She is the daughter of Tilda Swinton (and in fact we last saw Swinton Byrne in Tilda Swinton’s short film about her personal friend John Berger, part of a collection of four pieces about the late author and critic, entitled The Seasons in Quincy, in which Berger was shown giving Honor a hair-raising motorbike lesson). And Julie’s mother is duly played by Tilda Swinton, unobtrusively aged up as a patrician mamma. Is the film-making some kind of pre-emptive joke about entitlement in the film business? Surely not. It’s more a coolly disconcerting overlapping of fact and fiction. And this underlines the weirdness of what unfolds, which has the weightlessness of a dream, a style which reaches its high point when Julie is alone in the flat and it is briefly shaken, to the sound of a detonation – the sound, in fact, of the 1983 IRA Harrods bombing. And then things are eerily back to normal.Hogg shakes the film out of its trance when Anthony and Julie host a dinner party, attended by Anthony’s insufferable film-maker friend: a hilarious cameo for Richard Ayoade, who brayingly announces that it is appalling that Britain, the home of the Stones, the Kinks and the Small Faces, still doesn’t do movie musicals. (He doesn’t mention the Who, so is maybe not a fan of Tommy.) It is this character who is to make a further announcement about Anthony that reveals the poison cloud gathering over the head of poor, innocent Julie.Eventually, Julie is to be shown working on a different, more Jarmanesque-looking project, in a more rough-and-ready collaboration with other students. Yet the message is nothing so simplistic as just the need to get over her own well-heeled background. Her family are sympathetically portrayed. Positions of disapproval are not taken. It is a reverie, a daze, a strange spell of numbness – and it lingers in the mind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d59bc5385153f169210bf6d51ccf11ce7d501545/0_91_1744_1046/master/1744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d56dd8e38e8a0af7475ce040396d957","title":"mauricio pochettino spurs focus top four not cups","story":"• Tottenham manager says trophies only ‘build egos’• Second defeat in four days after League Cup exitMauricio Pochettino has defended his record at Tottenham and argued claiming silverware would serve only to “build egos” rather than maintain progress after seeing his team knocked out of a second domestic cup competition in four days.A side sporting seven changes from the Carabao Cup semi-final defeat by Chelsea on Thursday departed the FA Cup 2-0 at the hands of Crystal Palace, leaving Spurs, wounded by fatigue and injury, to concentrate on their Champions League tie against Borussia Dortmund and, realistically, a top-four finish in the Premier League.Pochettino, who has yet to claim a trophy in his managerial career, admitted disappointment at this rather meek defeat but suggested trophies would not maintain Spurs’ development as a club. “We are going to create a debate that to win a trophy is going to help the club,” he said. “I don’t agree with that. That only builds your ego. In reality the most important thing is being consistently in the top four and playing in the Champions League. That is going to help the club to achieve the last step.“The club is doing fantastically well. It’s so successful. In the last four or five years we’ve been fighting in different ways to achieve what the club needs, to be in the level of Chelsea, United, City, Arsenal or Liverpool. People wish we could win some trophies. But, being realistic, we are a team not built to win titles still.”Pochettino should have Son Heung-min, back from the Asia Cup, available for Wednesday’s game against Watford at Wembley. “It’s true, this season has been tough,” he said.“But to be a contender is always difficult for us. Now the realistic targets are trying to be in the top four, to try and be close to Manchester City and Liverpool and reduce the gap. Another is to try to beat Dortmund and be in the next round."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce7063858e56b96c41e50f402e8b104c59980617/1979_299_3237_1942/master/3237.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38bc4f8d0c7dfbda20c805a64a8555fe","title":"notts county owner hardy apologises for posting intimate picture online","story":"Notts County’s owner, Alan Hardy, is facing a Football Association investigation after he apologised for posting an intimate picture on Twitter on Sunday morning.An avid user of the social media site, Hardy, who bought the club in 2017 and is known as ‘Big Alan’, was attempting to show what he described as “the fickle side of football fans” and posted two screenshots of tweets from the same fan. The first one wished him a merry Christmas and the other said he had ruined the club, although one of the screenshots appears to show the businessman’s picture gallery from his phone, which featured a picture of his penis.He quickly deleted the tweet and later apologised: “This morning an inappropriate photo appeared in one of my tweets. This was clearly an honest mistake as a result of my camera roll being included in a screenshot. I tried to rectify the error by deleting the tweet as soon as I noticed and I apologise for any offence caused.”It is understood that the FA will contact Hardy to ask for his observations over the incident, with the 54-year-old claiming he would be deleting his Twitter account, although he had yet to do so on Sunday evening. He later announced he has put the League Two club up for sale after “considerable soul-searching”.“Thank you to everyone who continues to support me through what has been a very difficult time. Later this evening I will be deleting my account as I feel this is in the best interests of the football club, my family and myself,” Hardy added.“I have always seen Twitter as a way of engaging with supporters and monitoring ways we can improve as a club.

You may feel you deserve an alcoholic beverage after toughing it out all month – but have you forgotten what it feels like to wake up haunted by worries about what you said or did the night before? These post-drinking feelings of guilt and stress have come to be known colloquially as “hangxiety”. But what causes them?David Nutt, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College, London, is the scientist who was fired in 2009 as the government’s chief drug adviser for saying alcohol is more dangerous than ecstasy and LSD. I tell him I have always assumed my morning-after mood was a result of my brain having shrivelled like a raisin through alcohol-induced dehydration. When Nutt explains the mechanics of how alcohol causes crippling anxiety, he paints an even more offputting picture.Alcohol, he says, targets the Gaba (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor, which sends chemical messages through the brain and central nervous system to inhibit the activity of nerve cells. Put simply, it calms the brain, reducing excitement by making fewer neurons fire. “Alcohol stimulates Gaba, which is why you get relaxed and cheerful when you drink,” explains Nutt.The first two drinks lull you into a blissful Gaba-induced state of chill. When you get to the third or fourth drink, another brain-slackening effect kicks in: you start blocking glutamate, the main excitatory transmitter in the brain. “More glutamate means more anxiety,” says Nutt. “Less glutamate means less anxiety.” This is why, he says, “when people get very drunk, they’re even less anxious than when they’re a bit drunk” – not only does alcohol reduce the chatter in your brain by stimulating Gaba, but it further reduces your anxiety by blocking glutamate. In your blissed-out state, you will probably feel that this is all good – but you will be wrong.The body registers this new imbalance in brain chemicals and attempts to put things right. It is a little like when you eat a lot of sweets and your body goes into insulin-producing overdrive to get the blood sugar levels down to normal as soon as the sweets have been digested, all that insulin causes your blood sugar to crash. When you are drunk, your body goes on a mission to bring Gaba levels down to normal and turn glutamate back up. When you stop drinking, therefore, you end up with unnaturally low Gaba function and a spike in glutamate – a situation that leads to anxiety, says Nutt. “It leads to seizures as well, which is why people have fits in withdrawal.”It can take the brain a day or two to return to the status quo, which is why a hair of the dog is so enticing. “If you drank an awful lot for a long time,” says Nutt, “it might take weeks for the brain to readapt. In alcoholics, we’ve found changes in Gaba for years.”To add to the misery, the anxiety usually kicks in while you are trying to sleep off the booze. “If you measure sleep when people are drunk, they go off to sleep fast. They go into a deeper sleep than normal, which is why they sometimes wet the bed or have night terrors. Then, after about four hours, the withdrawal kicks in – that’s when you wake up all shaky and jittery.”Imbalances in Gaba and glutamate are not the only problem. Alcohol also causes a small rise in noradrenaline – known as the fight-or-flight hormone. “Noradrenaline suppresses stress when you first take it, and increases it in withdrawal,” says Nutt. “Severe anxiety can be considered a surge of noradrenaline in the brain.”Another key cause of hangxiety is being unable to remember the mortifying things you are sure you must have said or done while inebriated – another result of your compromised glutamate levels. “You need glutamate to lay down memories,” says Nutt, “and once you’re on the sixth or seventh drink, the glutamate system is blocked, which is why you can’t remember things.”One theory as to why very shy people might be more at risk of hangxiety and alcoholism is the possibility that alcohol’s seesaw effect on Gaba levels is more pronounced in them. Their baseline Gaba levels may be lower to start with, says Morgan. “It could also be a psychological effect – people who are more highly anxious are more prone to rumination, going over thoughts about the night before, so that’s another potential mechanism.”However, the study’s findings have wider implications – after all, most drinkers lean on alcohol as social lubrication to some degree.The bad news is that there seems to be little you can do to avoid hangxiety other than to drink less, and perhaps take painkillers – they will at least ease your headache. “Theoretically, ibuprofen would be better than paracetamol,” says Nutt, “because it’s more anti-inflammatory – but we don’t know how much of the hangover is caused by inflammation. It’s something we’re working on, trying to measure that.”Morgan suggests trying to break the cycle. “Before drinking in a social situation you feel anxious in, try fast-forwarding to the next day when you’ll have much higher anxiety levels. If you can’t ride that out without drinking, the worry is that you will get stuck in this cycle of problematic drinking where your hangxiety is building and building over time. Drinking might fix social anxiety in the short term, but in the long term it might have pretty detrimental consequences.” Exposure therapy is a common treatment for phobias, where you sit with your fear in order to help you overcome it. “By drinking alcohol, people aren’t giving themselves a chance to do that,” says Morgan.Until Alcosynth reaches the market, Nutt says his “strong” message is: “Never treat hangxiety with a hair of the dog. When people start drinking in the mornings to get over their hangxiety, then they’re in the cycle of dependence. It’s a very slippery slope.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03c7edf00adb1b1b9c357251d119bdffa41bb497/1_0_5280_3169/master/5280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81d7ce58aad9894ba0c06d0d19317bad","title":"my partner has started withdrawing before ejaculation why","story":"After many years, and dancing around the edges, my best friend and I have fallen for each other. We recently confessed our feelings, and are now together. We’re in our early 30s and feeling our way through our new relationship, and it’s wonderful. He is clear he does not want children, and I don’t see them in my future either. He knows this. Very recently during sex, he has started pulling out to ejaculate. I asked him about it, and he just said that he doesn’t want kids. I take oral contraceptives. We had sex a handful of times before our relationship, and it was not an issue then. I’m insulted, and worried that he thinks I would be careless or might “trap” him. We’re at a delicate stage in this transition, so I don’t want to make a fuss, but it’s really playing on my mind that he now doesn’t trust me. He says he loves me.You are right to judge this transition as delicate tread carefully, and try not to take his withdrawal personally. His opposition to having children may be rooted in deeply troubling aspects of his life, such as painful childhood memories – although perhaps he simply doesn’t feel ready for parenthood.Even though withdrawing is not a secure method of contraception, try to reframe his doing so as his way of protecting your relationship, or warding off what he may see as disaster for both of you. Perhaps he has been “trapped” in the past, in which case trust is at stake. In fact, many cases have shown that if there is even an unconscious desire on a woman’s part to have children, she might unconsciously “forget” to take her pill. Talk with him gently, seeking to understand his true feelings – and express yours. Also, examine your own feelings when he withholds his ejaculate – clearly, you feel distrusted, but do you also feel rejected? Punished? Dishonoured? Help him to understand and, hopefully, empathise. By the way, if you are hoping to have children at some point – and feel you need to do so at a biologically optimum time – it is essential to have that conversation pretty soon – in a frank and non-punitive manner.•Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.•If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@the (please don’t send attachments).

Being adolescent meant ignoring them. But now that you’re a grownup, there’s no running away. Thankfully, there are 10 simple ways to show you’re tackling adulthood like a proRecyclingThere was a time when all your rubbish went into one bin. Not any more. Now it’s a military operation – food, paper, cardboard, bottles and plastic all need to be separated and placed in specific colour-coded containers. But you’re well-drilled, you know the weekly collection rota and you have all the rubbish out the night before. You’ve nailed it.Weekly shopsNo more grazing on sweets in corner shops or picking up a ready meal on the way home from work. You climb in the car on Saturday mornings and drive to a supermarket on the outskirts of town and buy enough groceries to last you all week, resulting in a three-figure bill. Or you order it all online and have it delivered. But it still takes one simple thing that demonstrates you’re an adult: forward planning.Growing plants and vegetablesThis was something that once struck you as OAP behaviour and, frankly, back-breaking work. Then you discovered homegrown vegetables actually taste better and that growing a few plants is good for the soul. Now you visit garden centres and buy tools. Don’t eat at the garden centre cafe, though, that really is for old folk.Work the central heatingIt feels like you have two choices: hand over half your salary to the energy company or freeze. Real adults have mastered the central heating thermostat and the boiler timer and save money and energy as a result. It’s not rocket science, after all. Bonus tip: sign up to EnergyCheck from Compare the Market and it’ll contact you if you could save money on your bill.CleanOnce upon a time, your parents made you clean your room and it felt like punishment. Now you have your own place that is entirely your responsibility to take care of. You embrace it, grab some dusters, spray furniture polish, put on some music and bask in the thrill of sparkling surfaces.Stack the dishwasher correctlyYou used to balk at the washing up. Now you have a dishwasher and know that by arranging the plates at the back, bowls at the front, cutlery upright and cups on the top, it functions properly. Simple chore – such ordered joy.VotingCouncil election, general election, referendum – no matter what it is, you always find the time to vote. When you were younger, you didn’t even know where the polling station was, but then you realised you were making a huge mistake. It was your future they were deciding, after all.Assembling furnitureAs a kid, your parents expected you to make your bed. Now, when you buy one, you actually have to assemble it, too. In fact, all new furniture comes flatpacked, necessitating a crash course in DIY, a properly stocked toolbox and the ability to follow a badly translated set of instructions.Hold a dinner partyGetting a pizza in for the big match is a thing of the past. Now it’s all couples and entertaining. In best MasterChef style, you can prepare and cook at least three dishes, because melting cheese on nachos and buying an M\u0026ampS cheesecake just doesn’t cut it any more.Going to bed at a sensible timeStaying up until dawn gaming or clubbing might be possible at the weekend, but midweek you need a full eight hours or you’re tetchy the next day. Then you get run-down, and you know what happens when you get rundown: it all goes horribly wrong.Prove you’re an adult and download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck so you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

From planning meals to advice on decreasing the time you spend managing bills, here are some handy online resources to help tackle time-consuming everyday tasksThere are a few things in life that are seemingly never-ending: taxes, bills and housework, for example. According to research by the Association of Accounting Technicians, adults carry out an average of 109 life-admin tasks a year. The poll, which surveyed 2,000 Britons, found more than half of those taking part struggle to keep up with household paperwork and failed to complete everything by the required date.It also found that four urgent and important tasks are always in the pipeline. Mustering the effort to get them done is another issue altogether, but putting in a bit of effort can save a lot of time – and stress – in the long run. Here are some tips on how to keep on top of things.Offload meal prepEven with an Instagram-worthy pantry, sometimes just deciding what to eat for dinner can be a drain. Luckily, in the past few years, there has been a boom in subscription services. Companies such as HelloFresh allow you to choose up to five meals a week and have all the ingredients and recipes delivered to your door. Allplants is similar but caters to vegans, while Graze will sort out your snacks, and Naked Wines will make sure to deliver some nice wine to enjoy with whatever you cook.Get reminders whenever you can save money on billsCompare the Market has made it simple with EnergyCheck, a service that automatically checks if you could get a better deal than your current energy supplier. Tell them your gas and electricity usage once and you’ll never have to overpay again. Choose your ideal saving amount (£50 or £100, for example) and update your preferences on the go. You’ll get alerts to let you know if you can save, or if you’re still on a great deal – and you can switch energy providers simply.Cut time on managing billsManaging bills and paying them on time is one of the most common life-admin tasks and one that can have expensive consequences if they are not dealt with on time. Apps such as Splitwise help split bills between groups – such as housemates – so everyone pays a fair share and knows exactly what they owe. WonderBill gets all your household bills in one place, so there is no sifting through piles of paperwork or old emails to figure out which one needs to be paid and when.Automate your savingsSaving money can be a strain if you’re struggling to budget. But bank apps and money bots are great for finding ways to stockpile your piggy bank. Some allow users to set up savings “pots”, which automatically round up purchases to the nearest pound and collect the leftover change, which adds up surprisingly quickly. Then there are AI chatbots such as Cleo or Plum, which take the thinking out of money management by learning their users’ spending habits and sending out personalised prompts that remind them to put a little bit away for a rainy day.Make the most of your appsHaving all your devices sync together and talk seamlessly can save you a lot of time. If This Then That (IFTTT) is a platform that helps make this a reality. It allows you to create customised “applets” and use ones others have created to make day-to-day tasks a little bit easier. It works on the premise of “if this happens, then that happens”. So, for example, if you complete a workout on a fitness app then Google logs it in your calendar.Clean up your computerOne way to save time before you even begin a life-admin task is having everything properly organised – including on your computer. But, with all the photos, files, and apps that gradually pile up, organising your laptop can be a major life-admin task in itself. Using apps such as Hazel will help automatically organise files based on name, date and file type – plus you can have it rename files and sort them into subfolders so they can be accessed, deleted or backed up.

How else to explain that slangy, cheeky “z”? Yet after some early career highs and notably emotional lows (plus an eight-year career furlough in the 2000s), the archetypal Irish boyband have somehow endured.A sixth and apparently final Boyzone album, Thank You and Goodnight, marked their 25th anniversary last year. Now the fortysomething man-gang of Ronan Keating, Keith Duffy, Mikey Graham and Shane Lynch are selling out arenas on a sentimental goodbye tour before retiring the Boyzone marque for ever.Despite the quartet being framed by a gigantic screen beaming lyric videos and vintage footage of the band as fresh-faced youngsters, this is a refreshingly gimmick-free gig. Except for two glam back-up singers, there is no band on stage and at no point does a ’Zoner strap on an acoustic or slide behind a piano to underline their musical authenticity.They just sing, do some clomping dance moves and have a laugh. The result is a weirdly pure boyband experience, one enhanced by still deafening screams, even if the audience intensity ramps up noticeably whenever they return to their 90s heyday with songs such as Isn’t It a Wonder and their beloved (if bland) cover of Cat Stevens’ Father and Son.The centrepiece of the show is a tribute to founder member Stephen Gately, who died unexpectedly from a congenital heart defect in 2009. Dream, a new song featuring Gately vocals from a salvaged demo, is a swaying slice of clean-cut uplift that, performed from an island amid the crowd, serves as a fitting memorial. After that sombre sojourn, the rest of the gig is a scramble to pack in more material from Boyzone’s imperial phase, climaxing in the easygoing, matey Motown of Picture of You. In the end, they seem to be having so much fun that it would be foolish to rule out a sneaky 30th-anniversary reunion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bd6796a9d30d57abc0c4b54d22c6062c07df8b4/0_95_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=881d4f1c49b46159d7bc179ac8e7bdce","title":"planning for no deal on the brexit frontline podcast","story":"With less than 10 weeks to go until Britain leaves the EU and still no withdrawal deal agreed, businesses around the country are scrabbling to prepare for the worst-case scenario of a disorderly Brexit.

But Anneli Howard, a specialist in EU and competition law at Monckton Chambers and a member of the bar’s Brexit working group, believes this isn’t true.“No deal means leaving with nothing,” she said. “The anticipated recession will be worse than the 1930s, let alone 2008. It is impossible to say how long it would go on for. Some economists say 10 years, others say the effects could be felt for 20 or even 30 years: even ardent Brexiters agree it could be decades.”There are two apparently insurmountable hurdles to the UK trading on current WTO tariffs in the event of Britain crashing out in March, said Howard.Firstly, the UK must produce its own schedule covering both services and each of the 5,000-plus product lines covered in the WTO agreement and get it agreed by all the 163 WTO states in the 32 remaining parliamentary sitting days until 29 March 2019. A number of states have already raised objections to the UK’s draft schedule: 20 over goods and three over services.To make it more complicated, there are no “default terms” Britain can crash out on, Howard said, while at the same time, the UK has been blocked by WTO members from simply relying on the EU’s “schedule” – its existing tariffs and tariff-free trade quotas.The second hurdle is the sheer volume of domestic legislation that would need to be passed before being able to trade under WTO rules: there are nine statutes and 600 statutory instruments that would need to be adopted.The government cannot simply cut and paste the 120,000 EU statutes into UK law and then make changes to them gradually, Howard said. “The UK will need to set up new enforcement bodies and transfer new powers to regulators to create our own domestic regimes,” she said.“Basic maths shows that we will run out of time but any gap in our system will create uncertainty or conflict,” said Howard. “Some of these regimes carry penalties such as fines – even criminal offences in some sectors.”Unless there is an extension to article 50, both these hurdles will need to be crossed by 29 March. This, said Howard, was an impossible task. “Negotiating and ratifying the international free trade deals with the rest of the world alone could take over seven years,” she said.“A no-deal Brexit could double prices for some products like meat and dairy. There is also a greater risk of trade disputes and sanctions, resulting in reduced market access for UK businesses.“It’s not just about money,” she said. “We are dependent on imports for a lot of things that we don’t make any more or don’t make enough of, or simply cannot make as they are patented or subject to rules of origin – like lifesaving drugs, radioactive isotopes for MRI scans, medical equipment, chemicals, electricity, petrol, even milk. Shortages and delays could cause panic buying or even civil unrest.”Rhodri Thompson QC, a specialist in competition and EU law at Matrix Chambers, agreed. He said: “The truth is that this would be extremely difficult and would not cover much of the UK economy at all.”Howard dismissed ideas of a transition period enabling a “gradual transition” to WTO rules as “unicorns”. “The UK will have to start negotiating over 50 free trade agreements from scratch once we leave the EU. In the meantime we will have to pay tariffs.”Economists for Free Trade, a group with links to Jacob Rees-Mogg and David Davis, claims there is “nothing to fear” from leaving the EU without reaching an agreement.David Collins, a professor of international economic law at City University of London, said: “The UK can trade quite easily on an uncertified schedule.”However, Collins conceded that an uncertified schedule “might be an indication of that complaining member’s intention to initiate a dispute against the member,” and that “the WTO dispute settlement process can take several years to resolve”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebb573281467845123c913d9421c2a30fed36dbb/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c7b6e3c51370d323220fac24c7a5cd","title":"young people how do you feel about your future","story":"With 18-year-olds watching the outcome of Brexit unravel in front of them, we want to hear what you thinkFor years, it has been assumed that young people do not vote, do not take part in politics, and do not care.

A third major global problem is interlinked – climate change that is worsened by food production, waste and transportation.The commission said political leaders and civil society must step up to counter the commercial interests and lobbying of the food industry. It called for a UN treaty along the lines of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control to support countries in drawing up sustainable and healthy food policies. As the FCTC does with the tobacco industry, the proposed treaty would ban food and drink companies from discussions.The commission also recommended removing subsidies for agriculture and transport that contribute to poor diet and health. It proposed a $1bn (£760m) fund for civil society organisations that want to take on the food industry and press for sugar taxes and other measures to improve diets and counter obesity.The experts cited the work of the Mexican NGO El Poder Del Consumidor, which successfully fought for taxes on soft drinks, funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies.The food and drink industry has enormous power and the money to exert pressure on governments, said Tim Lobstein of the World Obesity Federation, one of the commissioners. In the US Congress, he pointed out, there are 294 lobbyists from food and drink companies, more than from either the tobacco or alcohol industries.“Of that, two-thirds are former Congress staff, so they know what they are doing. That level of lobbying is devoted to preserving the status quo. It is a major barrier to change and must be challenged,” he said.In the US and Australia, food industry pressure succeeded in keeping sustainability out of national dietary guidelines, the commission said. In the US, subsidies for fossil fuels keep petrol prices artificially low, encouraging car use rather than cycling, walking or taking public transport.No country has succeeded in reversing its obesity epidemic, said the experts, who argued a broader attack is needed.Prof Boyd Swinburn of the University of Auckland, the co-chair of the commission, said: “Until now, undernutrition and obesity have been seen as polar opposites of either too few or too many calories.“In reality, they are both driven by the same unhealthy, inequitable food systems, underpinned by the same political economy that is single-focused on economic growth and ignores the negative health and equity outcomes.“Climate change has the same story of profits and power ignoring the environmental damage caused by current food systems, transportation, urban design and land use.”Echoing the “planetary health diet” devised by a commission convened by the Lancet and the Eat Forum NGO, the obesity commission said there could be extensive benefits to the planet if people ate less red meat.As an example of the interconnection of obesity, malnutrition and climate change, the experts said reducing red meat consumption through taxes, redirected subsidies, health and environmental labelling, and social marketing would lead to healthier diets, prevention of cancer and obesity, more land for efficient, sustainable agriculture, opportunities to reduce undernutrition, and lower greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.Sustainable food production is rising, said Lobstein. Changing the practices of large food companies, however, will not happen quickly.“All these things are interrelated,” Lobstein said. “There are compounds in plastics that are endocrine disruptors, which may be contributing to obesity. If plastics in the food chain are causing weight gain, we will need win-win solutions to improve the food supply while saving the planet.”Fiona Sing of the World Cancer Research Fund said: “We support the implementation of a global treaty to limit the political influence of big food. How we produce and consume food is possibly the most important determinant of both human and environmental health worldwide.“Obesity and undernutrition affect billions of people and are major drivers in diet-related non-communicable diseases, including cancer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a26b749df26ee5520e5eb0c4ef381b6084174393/0_97_4260_2556/master/4260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a89f2c00c150c19da2f8e4ce8986b70","title":"novak djokovic rafael nadal australian open final","story":"Novak Djokovic is the best tennis player in the world: now, and for the foreseeable future, perhaps until he chooses to retire, which looks to be a few years away yet, he hinted on Sunday night. What the 31-year-old Serb can achieve in the remaining days of a career that began more than a thousand matches and 72 titles ago is difficult to gauge but less so than it was before the final of the Australian Open.What he did to Rafael Nadal in the Rod Laver Arena turned what had been a keen debating point about their relative merits, along with speculation about Roger Federer’s longevity, into a confident assertion that Djokovic has moved into another area of excellence.As Pat Cash, working in Melbourne for Eurosport, said: “I’ve run into a few tennis players today and they’ve all said they’ve never seen a tennis ball hit like that in their lives. Novak can do that. It was absolutely mind-blowing tennis.” His colleague and former champion Mats Wilander described Djokovic’s performance as “absolute perfection”.If Nadal could not stay with Djokovic for more than a few scattered moments of a final that lasted only two hours and four minutes, winning eight games and failing to take a point off his serve 56 times in 69 attempts, there is little chance for anyone else to inconvenience a player who has won three majors in a row and this year may even do the calendar grand slam for the first time since Rod Laver in 1969.It was, curiously, a towering anticlimax of a final. It was not just that the world No 1 destroyed the world No 2 in every department. It was that this was supposed to be a high point, a grand conclusion to a fascinating tournament, one in which John McEnroe prematurely announced, “a changing of the guard”.There were few secrets between the finalists. It should have been much tighter than this. Only Fred Perry and Ellsworth Vines knew each other better on a tennis court than do Djokovic and Nadal they played 162 times in the late 30s, barnstorming around the United States, the UK, Caribbean and South America in high-grade exhibition matches, with the American winning 88-74.All of which makes the Djokovic-Nadal series of 53 matches seem tame – until you look closely at the intensity of their exchanges, as well as the length and importance of the occasions. This was their 15th best-of-five contest, taking in all the biggest cathedrals of the sport, the most memorable of which, famously, was the final in Melbourne in 2012, which lasted longer than any other decider of a major in history, five hours and 53 minutes.Nadal was the first to “arrive”, winning his first major at the sixth attempt, 14 years ago – so he was slam-savvy when they first clashed in 2006, and dominated Djokovic pretty much until 2011, winning 16 of their first 25 matches. The second half of their story swings the other way, however. Nadal has beaten Djokovic only three times in 16 meetings since the second of his US Open final victories over him in 2013. It looks as if the only place he can stop him is Roland Garros, and even that is not the good bet it once was. If Djokovic were to beat Nadal to win the French Open, there would not be a T-shirt to house the Serb’s pride.Djokovic says the hunger has not left him. “The tennis court is a place where I’m naked, where I’m exposed to both extremes in terms of emotions and character. That’s where I have the opportunity to learn about myself. The hunger is always there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25b098aef62824d1d2ed3a6abd2329642b86841/0_0_5326_3551/master/5326.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=83811780fe32b2340b089a12a69daa12 1400w","title":"facebook restricts campaigners ability to check ads for political transparency","story":"Social media network says the change was part of crackdown on third party plug-insFacebook has restricted the ability of external political transparency campaigners to monitor adverts placed on the social network, in a move described as an “appalling look” by one of the organisations affected.WhoTargetsMe, a British group dedicated to scrutinising adverts on the social network, has said its activities have been severely restricted by recent changes made by the social network. The change has also hit a similar programme by the US investigative journalism site ProPublica, affecting both groups’ ability to collect data on why users are being targeted by political campaigners.The monitoring tools, which involve asking users to install a browser plug-in and collecting data on the adverts they see, has helped expose many of the advertising tactics used by politicians, making it harder for those who pay for negative adverts to escape scrutiny.“Ten days ago, our software stopped working, and efforts to fix it have proved much harder than before,” said WhoTargetsMe co-founder Sam Jeffers. He said he feared his service could soon be in effect locked out of Facebook altogether. “Facebook is deliberately obfuscating their code. When we have made small changes, they’ve responded with further updates within hours.“This comes in a year when over a third of the world’s population has the opportunity to vote, with elections across the EU, India, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Israel and Ukraine to name a few. In sum, they are actively trying to stop our project from gathering data about the ads they run, and the targeting of those ads. Obviously, we think this is the wrong decision.”Facebook said the change was part of a wider crackdown on third party plug-ins such as ad blockers accessing unauthorised data from its site, although the 20,000 people who have signed up to WhoTargetsMe have chosen to share their data with the service.“We regularly improve the ways we prevent unauthorised access by third parties like web browser plug-ins to keep people’s information safe,” said Facebook spokesperson Beth Gautier. “This was a routine update and applied to ad blocking and ad scraping plug-ins, which can expose people’s information to bad actors in ways they did not expect.”WhoTargetsMe was founded ahead of the 2017 general election in response to concerns about the impact of online advertising during the EU referendum, when millions of pounds was spent on Facebook advertising by both Leave and Remain with little scrutiny of what voters were seeing.Data collected by the UK organisation has helped to show how the Conservatives were focusing on personal criticism of shadow home secretary Diane Abbott during the end of the 2017 campaign, in addition to using a loophole in electoral law to campaign on local issues through targeted Facebook ads without breaking spending limits.In addition, its tool has helped WhoTargetsMe to monitor elections around the world, with the site highlighting unusual advertising practices during Germany’s elections and in Ireland during the country’s referendum on abortion.A similar ad monitoring tool, established by ProPublica, has also been affected by the changes. That tool had resulted in negative stories for the social network such as exposing how oil companies are sidestepping Facebook’s new ad transparency tools among other issues.At the end of 2018, Facebook launched its own political ad archive, a move broadly welcomed by campaigners that has already resulted in additional scrutiny of political advertisers on the service including the government and obscure pro-Brexit campaign groups.However, the social network has also been slow to give direct access to the new database to journalists and researchers, while it is currently only available in the US, UK, and Brazil – although it plans to roll it out across the EU before this spring’s European parliament elections.Facebook has insisted its in-house transparency page is industry-leading but Jeffers said it is still “inadequate” as it doesn’t provide meaningful information about why a user is being targeted, or who is ultimately behind such advertising."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f29a8cd44d6abdaa8ccc9655b9b27d9abd973f4c/0_69_2790_1675/master/2790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c73ca0ffd4175afbdc3effd2d9517b1","title":"maduro rejects ultimatum on fresh elections in venezuela","story":"Crisis-hit country’s president under pressure as US urges the world to ‘pick a side’The White House national security adviser John Bolton has warned against violence or intimidation of American diplomats in Venezuela or opposition leader Juan Guiadó, saying such action would trigger a response from the United States.“Any violence and intimidation against US diplomatic personnel, Venezuela’s democratic leader, Juan Guiado (sic), or the National Assembly itself would represent a grave assault on the rule of law and will be met with a significant response,” Bolton said in a Twitter post on Sunday, also blaming Cuba for supporting Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro’s paramilitary forces.His comments came as Israel and Australia joined the chorus of countries recognising Guaidó as interim president. “We now urge all parties to work constructively towards a peaceful resolution of the situation, including a return to democracy, respect for the rule of law and upholding of human rights of the Venezuelan people,” Australia’s foreign affairs minister Marise Payne said on Monday morning.Maduro, has rebuffed calls from the international community to hold elections within eight days, protracting a diplomatic crisis that shows little respite.In a wide-ranging interview with CNN Türk that aired on Monday, Maduro accused the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, of violating “the constitution and every law”. Guaidó, the leader of the opposition-held national assembly, declared himself interim president on Wednesday as hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans took to the streets to protest against Maduro’s rule.The United States, Canada and a dozen Latin American countries swiftly recognised Guaidó, the fresh-faced leader of the once-fractured opposition, and labelled Maduro a dictator, responsible for the economic and political crisis that engulfed his South American nation.Britain, Germany, France and Spain all said they would recognise Guaidó unless Maduro called elections within eight days, an ultimatum that Jorge Arreaza, Venezuela’s bullish foreign minister, dismissed as “childlike”. Russia, one of Maduro’s staunchest allies, described the threat as “absurd”.However, Maduro retains the support of China, Cuba, Bolivia and Turkey and, most importantly perhaps, he still has the backing of the military – long the arbiter of political disputes – though his defence attache to the Venezuelan embassy in Washington defected to Guaidó on Saturday. In an attempt to trigger more defections, Guaidó is canvassing military bases, offering amnesty to troops who switch sides.Oil-rich Venezuela is wracked with hyperinflation, rendering the bolivar currency practically worthless. Shortages in food staples and basic medicines are rampant and crime is widespread. More than 3 million Venezuelans have fled, causing consternation across the continent.Maduro, who has frequently blamed the crisis on an “economic war” waged by the US, won re-election last May in a vote widely regarded as a sham. Shortly before his second two-year term began in early January, Guaidó – a relative unknown inside and outside Venezuela – indicated he would be ready to assume the presidency on an interim basis. He made good on that promise last Wednesday.When Trump formally recognised Guaidó as interim president last Wednesday, Maduro swiftly broke off diplomatic ties and demanded that all staff be pulled out of the embassy by Sunday, an order that the state department dismissed as illegitimate.On Saturday, Maduro extended the deadline by a month and told CNN that he had reached out to Trump but had not received a response. “He despises us,” Maduro said, adding that he was “overwhelmed with his internal problems”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/661eb94676d9e74f4da63146fb529a413e1ef625/0_285_5629_3378/master/5629.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36d7596060f1225d3fc7c53aeb675579","title":"i had to open a window new zealanders poke fun at tepid heatwave","story":"Some describe having to take it easy on the stairs after heatwave reports leave them coldNew Zealanders have poked fun at health warnings issued after the country was hit by a heatwave that reached only 25C in some of the country’s main cities.Some described how they had to pause – briefly – while climbing the stairs, and open windows in 21C heat, a far cry from the temperatures of over 49C recorded in Australia as a result of the same weather system.In some parts of the country temperatures were expected to be six degrees higher than average this week, reaching more than 30C along the east coast of the country, and peaking at 35.3C in Woodbourne. But in many others parts of the country the mercury struggled to push into the mid-20s.Although the temperatures would seem fairly unremarkable in many countries during summer, health officials have advised New Zealanders to stay inside during the heatwave, avoid alcohol and check on elderly neighbours and children. Taking a cold bath or shower could also help, experts said.Fire and Emergency told New Zealanders to clear their gutters of leaves and debris, and refrain from mowing the lawn.Some people said they slept with ice-packs to keep cool, or chewed on ice cubes throughout the day, and described the weather as “like an oven” or “being blasted with a hair dryer”.The heatwave was at its weakest in the cities of Wellington, Dunedin and Invercargill, where temperatures failed to reach 25C, prompting many to have fun with the warnings.“It’s 21 degrees in Wellington, I had to open a window” said one resident on Twitter.Dr Alex Macmillan, a senior lecturer in environmental health at the University of Otago, said the warmer than usual temperatures could still cause havoc for cool-blooded Kiwis.“While New Zealand’s high temperatures are not like those being seen in Australia, it’s what our bodies are used to and our buildings are designed for that matters most,” he told Stuff. “In New Zealand, this means temperatures in the mid-30 degrees Celsius, which we are simply not prepared for.”The Stuff news website had rolling coverage of the heatwave, including a report from Napier where the temperature reached 33C.“Cool breezes emanated from air-conditioned stores down Emerson Street, but they were ineffective in the bid to minimise perspiration,” the report read.Some companies reported changing their business hours to a Mediterranean schedule to cope, while the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research warned that people might lose sleep due to warm, sticky nights.“If you have multiple consecutive bad nights of sleep, I think that starts affecting your wellbeing,” Chris Brandolino, Niwa’s principal scientist, told

Photograph: iStockYoung “digital natives” are much more likely to absorb information from printed books rather than screens even though they have grown up surrounded by iPads and smartphones, new research shows.The analysis of how more than 170,000 people are learning across Europe finds that paper is the preferred reading medium for both children and young adults when reading novels and longer-form articles.Researchers have found that young readers are more likely to skim longer pieces of text when using iPads or e-readers, especially when under time pressure.They are also less likely take notes for comprehension or “get lost” in the immersive experience of a novel when reading on screens.Dr Ann Marcus-Quinn, a lecturer at University of Limerick who is part of an EU-wide research team, said the findings have implications for how students learn both at home and in the classroom.“Just because young people can master electronic devices doesn’t mean that they have the critical skills to interpret texts,” she said.The research also indicates that teachers tend to underestimate the negative impact of digital technology when their students read longer texts, while students are more likely to be overconfident about their comprehension ability, researchers found.However, Dr Marcus-Quinn cautioned against ditching technology entirely and said shorter texts, such as poetry, can work well on screens.She said she is involved in research which indicates that engagement with poetry can be boosted when there is access to layers of richer content on screens, such as deeper analysis of the text.There have been a team of almost 200 scholars and scientists researching the impact of digitisation on reading practices across the EU as part of a wider research project.It has involved more than 50 inidual studies with more than 170,000 participants over the past four years.Dr Marcus-Quinn said there is a major challenge to discover ways in which to facilitate deep reading of long-form texts in a screen environment given the growing use of screens.As part of the project, Dr Marcus-Quinn and Dr Triona Hourigan of UL have been focusing on the impact of e-learning for reading-based activities in secondary schools.They are investigating how typographic presentation can optimise users’ experience of learning from screens.Experts involved in the research group – known as E-Read, or Evolution of Reading in the Age of Digitisation – have called for caution when introducing digital technology into education on foot of these findings.They have also urged that teachers should be made aware that a “rapid and indiscriminate” move away from paper is “not neutral”.“Unless accompanied by carefully developed digital learning tools and strategies, they may cause a setback in the development of children’s reading comprehension and emerging critical thinking skills,” the group said, in a joint statement.Funding for the research has been partly prompted by concern within the EU over relatively low reading standards compared to Asian countries.In international reading assessments, however, Irish children are the best readers in Europe and among the best in the world."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3772521.1548615087!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"more children leaving

Photograph: Bryan O’Brien Rising numbers of schoolchildren are leaving home earlier in the morning for long commutes, or to access early-morning school activities such as sports or study, latest figures indicate.While classes commence in most primary and secondary schools at around 9am, before-school activities are proving more popular among children in commuting families where both parents are working.A large number of primary schools in Dublin and other urban areas have started providing supervised play on site from before 8am, as well as after-school and homework clubs in the late afternoon and early evening.At second level, many fee-paying schools in particular are opening their doors earlier to provide study or sports training before class.Latest official figures compiled by the Central Statistics Office confirm that children are getting up earlier to leave for school.A breakdown of the 2016 census, for example, shows more than 20,000 pupils are on the road from between 6 and 7.30 am in morning, an increase of almost 40 per cent on the 2011 census. A large proportion are based in commuter-belt counties.The average time it took to get to school was just under an hour for those who left before 6.30am, falling to just under 40 minutes for those who left between 7 and 7.30am and 11 minutes for those leaving between 8.30 and 9am.Census figures also show the car is becoming more popular among second-level students for getting to school.Just over four in 10 secondary students travelled to school as a passenger by car, up 16 per cent on 2011.Over 42 per cent of rural secondary students were reliant on the bus to get to school.Overall, the latest census shows commuting times rose in every county and the national average commuting time in April 2016 was 28.2 minutes, up from 26.6 minutes in 2011.Commuters in counties bordering Dublin had the longest average commuting time, with those in Meath and Wicklow travelling for almost 35 minutes.Almost 200,000 commuters, or one in 10, spent an hour or more commuting to work, an increase of almost 50,000 (31 per cent ) on 2011.Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington in Co Louth – where 28 per cent of workers were commuting an hour or more – had the highest percentage, followed by Skerries, Co Dublin and Greystones-Delgany, Co Wicklow.In 2016, there were almost 82,000 parents with children under 15 who spent an hour or more commuting to work.Of these, just over 43,000 were parents of pre-school children, an increase of 23 per cent on 2011.In Wicklow, Meath, Laois, Kildare and Westmeath, one in five parents of under-four year olds had a commute of over an hour."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoDevastating scene\u0026rsquo: Area sealed off and preserved for full technical examinationThe county has one of worst death tolls in the State \u0026ndash eight have died so far this yearAlzheimer\u0026rsquos society report finds those with condition have few social connectionsHauliers warned not to enter Port without customs paperwork for UK-bound goodsMajority who contact Abhaile about debts and mortgage arrears are in employmentCommittee established in 2018 to remove citizenship from those who obtained it fraudulentlyRegina Doherty says she wants to introduce annual eye and dental checks for childrenReports reveal \u0026lsquosubstandard\u0026rsquo construction work and fire safety concerns at BelmayneIf UK stays in customs union and rejects hard border, negotiations could begin \u0026ndash sourcesRichard Bruton is committed to increasing plastic recycling rates to 55 per cent by 2030Children with long commutes or in need of pre-school care travelling earlier than beforeIrish Nurses and Midwives Organisation appeal to Taoiseach to help call off stoppagesHSE blamed for contract with homes that do \u0026lsquonot recognise reality of costs\u0026rsquoMajor research finds young people absorb more from printed page than device screensParking increases will hit streets near hospitals under new city council planAdvocacy group says many vital services for deaf people might have to closeFianna F\u0026aacuteil TD Aindrias Moynihan made the most number of representations in 2017Pat Crean indicates he will pursue development of St Paul\u0026rsquos lands following refusalDoctors fearful of criminalisation as women present at 11 weeks\u0026rsquo gestationNUI Galway researchers devise new national \u0026lsquoactive consent\u0026rsquo programme"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3772634.1548622836!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin says brexit deal could be reopened if uk moves on red line issues","story":"The Government is willing to see the Brexit deal reopened if the United Kingdom wants to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU or allows for Northern Ireland-specific measures to avoid a hard border.Sources in Dublin said the withdrawal agreement – which the EU has publicly so far said is the only deal on the table – could be renegotiated if Britain moves from its own so-called “red lines”.The withdrawal agreement is one part of the overall package struck between the EU and UK last November. It is the 585 page, legally-binding element which spells out of the terms of how the UK leaves the EU.The second part is the looser joint political declaration, which sketches out the shape of the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the bloc. Thus far, the EU has emphasised this element as the method by which it could respond to changing British priorities.Well-placed sources now acknowledge that the withdrawal agreement itself could be reopened, although it is maintained that this has always been a possibility.Such a move would require the article 50 negotiating period to be extended.While the UK has asked for changes on the backstop – the insurance policy to prevent a hard border if there is no future EU-UK trade deal – sources say they have offered nothing in return.“Nothing is being offered in return for a concession,” said a source, adding examples of UK concessions that could include “permanent customs union or NI (Northern Ireland) specific arrangement”.The customs union requires that its members impose no tariffs on goods traded among each other, and sets a common duty on the goods of non-members.Recent days have seen senior Irish figures strongly rule out any change to the backstop, the element of the withdrawal agreement which is the main stumbling block to it passing a vote in the House of Commons.Tánaiste Simon Coveney on Sunday said there will be no change to the backstop, and added it cannot be replaced with an “aspirational” hope or commitment. He told the BBC nobody has come up with an alternative to it.The backstop would see the entire UK remain in a common customs area with the EU, with adds-on in respect of both customs and regulations for Northern Ireland. Mr Coveney said it will not be changed.“The backstop is already a compromise,” he said. He said a review mechanism had already been stitched into it, and warned: “The European Parliament will not ratify a withdrawal agreement that doesn’t have a backstop in it. It’s as simple as that.”In the UK on Tuesday, MPs will debate the next steps the government should take on Brexit, with amendments proposing alternative courses of action. Senior Conservative backbenchers led by 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady have tabled an amendment calling for prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal to be approved on condition that the backstop is replaced with alternative measures to prevent a hard border.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photographer: Aidan CrawleyBloombergGetty ImagesHauliers will be warned in the run-up to Brexit not to enter Dublin Port unless they have customs paperwork completed for UK-bound goods to avoid traffic congestion outside the port.The State’s busiest port plans to run an information campaign for hauliers in the weeks leading up to the UK leaving the EU on March 29th, setting out strict rules to ensure they have correct customs numbers and declaration forms completed before heading into the port in order to prevent traffic jams.The Revenue Commissioners has said that ferry companies will not permit lorries or unaccompanied trailers destined for the UK to board unless they have the required paperwork filled out.On their arrival into the port, Revenue plans to operate a traffic-light system by which hauliers arriving from the UK will be informed 15 minutes before their docking in Dublin whether they face inspections or can leave the port.These are among a series of precautionary measures, both commercial and operational, that Dublin Port Company, the State authorities and the ferry companies are planning to minimise post-Brexit delays.The port, which handles about 90 per cent of the roll-on, roll-off road freight coming on and off the island, stands at 650 metres from the Dublin Port Tunnel and the start of the M50 ring road around the city.On a typical morning, from around 6am to 9am, four ferries depart for English ports with a capacity for more than 12 lane-kilometres of space aboard for lorries, vans and unaccompanied trailers.The tunnel would bear the brunt of any traffic congestion at the port spilling back into the city.EU rules prohibit standing traffic so if there is congestion at either end of the tunnel, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), the State body responsible for the tunnel, must close it to traffic.One potential option being considered in no-deal Brexit contingency planning would be a lifting of the ban on lorries passing through Dublin city centre should the tunnel have to close in the event of severe traffic congestion.“Work is progressing on finalising traffic flows within the port in a no-deal scenario and this will inform contingency planning in relation to traffic flows outside of the port,” said a Department of Transport spokeswoman.“As we are in an unprecedented situation, all possible scenarios are being considered.”Dublin Port Company, which is responsible for traffic management inside the 760-acre port, is confident that a series of measures it is planning will prevent traffic congestion inside or outside the port.Eamonn O’Reilly, the port company’s chief executive, said it would be insisting that no hauliers will be permitted to board a UK-bound ship after Brexit unless they have a customs entry number.“No ferry is taking a booking for a lorry or trailer without a customs number. We don’t want to invite the problem down into the port,” he said.Mr O’Reilly said Dublin Port stands on a larger plot of land than the busy English port of Dover where space constraints have raised major concerns about the port’s capacity to cope with Brexit-related delays.The port has the capacity to prevent a congestion in container traffic at one of the three lift-on, lift-off container terminals by halving the time companies can leave containers at the port and doubling the charges.“If you start to introduce such charges, there will be a reaction. I would be confident of that. We have available to us a whole series of measures, the likes of which Dover doesn’t have,” said Mr O’Reilly.“As a general principle, we will look to put in operational measures to counteract congestion.”TII said its focus was on the efficient operation of the tunnel pre- and post-Brexit and it would engage with the department, Dublin City Council and others “on any issue that may impact our operations”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The plantation\u0026nbspfollows the defeat of northern Gaelic chieftains and the Flight of the Earls in 1603. The king grants land in six counties west of the Bann Derry, Donegal, Fermanagh, Tyrone, Cavan and Armagh to Scottish and English settlers. Substantial private plantations are also underway involving Scottish settlers in Antrim and Down with large swathes of the two counties given to loyal Scottish noblemen. Some four million acres are transferred from Gaelic Irish to planters.1641: Ulster explodes in open warfare between English and Scottish settlers and the native Irish. Dispossessed Catholics take revenge on settlers, slaughtering thousands. In 1642 Scottish Covenanters, a Presbyterian militia, invade the North and take their revenge on many of the Catholic\u0026nbspinhabitants. Tit-for-tat killings continue for the next decade. “On both sides there is nothing but burning, robbing in cold blood and cruelties such as are not usual even among the Moors or Arabs,” Irish nobleman Owen Roe O’Neill observes. The massacre of Protestant settlers has a profound impact on the psyche of those who settle\u0026nbspin Ulster.1690: William of Orange defeats exiled King James II at the Battle of the Boyne. The battle is decisive in consolidating Protestant domination in Ireland.1782-1800: Grattan’s short-lived parliament gives legislative independence within the Crown to an Irish Parliament, albeit one consisting exclusively of members of the Protestant Ascendancy.1800: The 1798 rebellion puts paid to Grattan’s parliament. The parliament is abolished in 1800 under the Act of Union. Henceforth, Irish MPs will only sit in Westminster. For the whole of the 19th century, Irish nationalists campaign for an end to the Act of Union.1870: Isaac Butt forms the Home Rule Association which campaigns for self-government for Ireland within the United Kingdom.1882: The Irish Parliamentary Party is formed to elect MPs to the Westminster parliament with the goal of achieving home rule for Ireland. The party dominates Irish electoral politics until 1918.1886: The first Home Rule Bill is introduced into the House of Commons by British prime minister William Gladstone. The first stirrings of fierce Ulster opposition to home rule are apparent as sectarian riots hit Belfast in June after the bill is defeated. Dozens are killed. Unionist opposition coalesces to oppose home rule with the phrase “Ulster will fight and Ulster will be right”.1892: A second Home Rule Bill is passed in the House of Commons, but defeated in the House of Lords.April 1912: The Irish Parliamentary Party again holds the balance of power in Westminster. A third Home Rule Bill is introduced into the parliament. This time the power of the House of Lords to defeat it is curbed. It is due to become law in 1914.September 28th 1912: Edward Carson organises the Ulster Covenant. More than 450,000 sign a pledge to resist home rule.January 1913: The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an armed militia opposed to home rule, is founded.November 1913: The Irish Volunteers is founded by nationalists to ensure the introduction of home rule in Ireland and as a counter-militia to the UVF.March 1914: The Curragh incident occurs. More than 50 British army officers based in Ireland indicate that they will resign their commissions rather than move against Ulster. The proposed mutiny convinces many Irish nationalists that the British cannot be trusted to implement home rule.March 1914: John Redmond concedes the “hateful expedient” of partition with the expectation that Ulster will be excluded from the initial home rule settlement though the number of counties involved has yet to be decided. He insists on it being time-limited to six years but Unionist leader Edward Carson dismisses the time limits as a “stay of execution”.April 1914: The UVF smuggle 20,000 German rifles with three million rounds of ammunition into the port of Larne.July 1914: The Buckingham Palace conference takes place between nationalist and unionist leaders over the implementation of home rule. At the same time the British cabinet pores over maps of border counties examining nationalist areas that might be included in a home rule parliament.“We sat again for an hour and a half discussing maps and figures and always getting back to that most damnable creation of the perverted ingenuity of man - the County of Tyrone,” British prime minister Herbert Asquith declares.“I have rarely felt more hopeless in any practical affair: an impasse with unspeakable consequences upon a matter which to English eyes seems inconceivably small and to Irish eyes immeasurably big. Isn’t it a real tragedy?”\u0026nbspNo agreement is reached about what parts of Ulster can be excluded from home rule. The first World War breaks out a week later.September 1914: The Home Rule Act becomes law, but is suspended for the duration of the war.April 1916: The Easter Rising occurs in Dublin. Rebels who take up arms against the British reject home rule, which would have given Ireland self-government within the United Kingdom. They want an independent Irish republic.July 1917-April 1918: The Irish Convention is called. Nationalists and unionists meet to try and decide an agreed future for Ireland, but the assembly is boycotted by Sinn Féin. The issue of customs dominates many of the early proceedings with nationalists insisting that a home rule parliament should have control of customs revenue - at that time the chief way in which governments raised taxation. This is vehemently opposed by unionists who fear tariffs and customs will cut Northern industry off from its most important market in Britain.The final report is passed by 66 votes to 34. It envisaged a home rule parliament for the whole country with safeguards for Ulster, but its implementation is bound up with the introduction of conscription in Ireland in April 1918 and is rejected. Nationalists and unionists would not meet again to discuss the future of Ireland until the Sunningdale conference of 1973.April 1918: After the death of the Irish Parliamentary Party leader John Redmond in March, his successor John Dillon leads the party out of the House of Commons in protest at the imposition of conscription in Ireland.January 1919: Sinn Féin, which wins a landslide victory in the 1918 general election, convenes the first Dáil. On the same day the War of Independence begins with the goal of securing an independent Ireland. The first Dáil and the War of Independence both envisage a united independent Ireland.September 1919: The British government struggles to enact the Home Rule Act which is now opposed by both nationalists and unionists. A committee headed by the colonial secretary and arch-unionist Walter Long is set up to examine this option. Somewhat surprisingly the committee proposes a two home rule-parliament solution, one for Ulster and the other for the rest of Ireland. This is a volte-face for unionism as they had been adamant that they wanted to remain an integral part of the United Kingdom. The committee concludes: “The sacrifice which Ulster will be called upon to make in assuming control of its own local affairs is one which the imperial government and parliament is clearly entitled to ask its people to make”.Unionist leader James Craig says he will not oppose a parliament for Ulster provided it consists of six counties with a Unionist majority rather than the nine counties of the historic province. This is to ensure a built-in unionist majority into perpetuity. Unionists reason that including the Catholic-majority provinces of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan will imperil the long-term future of Northern Ireland.Many unionists are also convinced that they cannot trust successive British governments to safeguard the separation of Ulster from the rest of Ireland and believe only a home rule parliament for Northern Ireland will suffice.December 22nd, 1919: David Lloyd George introduces the committee findings into the House of Commons. He supports the idea of two home rule parliaments for Ireland and says that if the Irish want unity, the British will not stand in their way. He also warns that the British will fight any attempts by the Irish to separate in the same way the Union fought the Confederates in the American Civil War.December 23th, 1920: The Government of Ireland Act 1920 becomes law almost exactly a year after the bill is introduced into the House of Commons. It creates two home rule parliaments and ides Ireland on a 26six county basis. Northern Ireland is created. The act is rejected by Sinn Féin which demands full independence, but Ulster unionists accept it.June 1921: Northern Ireland is created with the opening of its parliament by King George V. The king makes a conciliatory speech saying: “I appeal to all Irishmen to pause, to stretch out the hand of forbearance and conciliation, to forgive and to forget, and to join in making for the land which they love a new era of peace, contentment, and goodwill.”July 11th 1921: A truce is called between crown forces and republicans to allow for talks about the future of Ireland.December 1921: The Anglo-Irish Treaty is signed setting up the Irish Free State and copper fastening partition. The Irish Free State is created and it will have dominion status within the British empire - effectively independence. Nationalists believe partition will be a temporary issue as clause 12 of the Treaty provides for a Border Commission. Many nationalists are confident that the commission will make Northern Ireland so small as to render it unviable.January 1922: The Treaty is ratified narrowly by the Dáil. A general election in June 1922 is won mostly by pro-Treaty politicians, but it is not enough to prevent the Civil War breaking out.December 1922: The Irish Free State comes into being, making the Border an international frontier.April 1923: The Irish Free State introduces customs controls which remain until 1993 and the creation of the Single Market. These customs posts are manned with varying degrees of efficiency and smuggling becomes a way of life for many in border areas.November 1925: The Boundary Commission report is leaked to the Morning Post. Far from proposing the wholesale changes nationalists wanted, it only envisaged a modest transfer of land from Northern Ireland to the Free State. The Free State representative Eoin Mac Neill resigns. The Free State Government is panicked by the news and seeks concessions from both the British and Unionist governments. None are forthcoming, with both governments reminding their Irish counterparts that the commission was doing what it set out to do which was to look for possible territorial swaps on both sides of the Border. Eventually the impoverished Free State agrees to drop its demand for the inclusion of nationalist areas in the North in return for a debt write-off. The British agreed to cancel Ireland’s imperial debt obligation and the status quo remains.1932-1936: The Economic War between Britain and Ireland has\u0026nbspa detrimental impact on border commerce. Farmers and food producers in border regions are required to pay import duties on agricultural produce goods can only be transferred across the border at 16 customs posts. The impact is severe with cross-border trade declining by two thirds.1956-1962: The IRA’s border campaign sees the closure of many minor roads and increased security in border areas.1969-1995: The Troubles again see the closure of several minor roads and regular British army checkpoints become a feature of life particularly in south Armagh.August 1970: The Border road at Crossmaglen is closed after two RUC men are shot dead.August 1972: A bomb planted by the Provisional IRA blows up a customs post in Newry killing nine people, including the three IRA members who planted the bomb.1993: All customs posts on the island for Ireland are abolished as the EU Single Market comes into force.2006: The last British watchtower is dismantled. This effectively ends the Border as a visible entity.June 2016: The United Kingdom votes to leave the European Union.January 2017: British prime minister Theresa May says Brexit means being out of both the single market and the customs union. This means the integrity of the single market can only be maintained if there is a customs frontier between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. This means customs checks and a hard border.December 2017: The UK and the EU agree a deal with creates a “backstop”. The backstop states that, in the absence of a comprehensive trade agreement between the EU and the UK, it will ensure there will be no hard border between the North and South. In other words, in the absence of another solution for the Border, Northern Ireland will effectively remain within the EU customs union.November 2018: The UK Withdrawal Agreement is published which sets up a transitional arrangement that will be in force until December 2020. Crucially it confirms that the backstop will operate by keeping the UK in the customs union with the EU in order to avoid a hard border.January 2019: The Withdrawal Agreement is rejected by UK MPs by a vote of 432 to 202 making a no-deal Brexit more likely.January 22nd, 2019: The European Commission confirms publicly for the first time that a no-deal Brexit will lead to a hard border on the island of Ireland."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3772590.1548620474!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nursing homes charge residents for products free with medical card","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tImelda Munster said private nursing homes charged residents for wound dressings and bedsore creams as well as for services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Photograph: iStockPrivate nursing homes have blamed the HSE for them charging residents for medical products and services they would receive free of charge if living at home or in a public nursing home.Tadhg Daly, chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI), the organisation representing a majority of private facilities, said the HSE was responsible for the “discriminatory practice”.Mr Daly’s comments follow criticism by Sinn Féin TD Imelda Munster of the ongoing practice where residents in private nursing homes are being forced to pay for what they would receive free of charge if living at home or in a public nursing home.Ms Munster said private nursing homes charged residents for items such as wound dressings, prescription painkillers and bedsore creams as well as for services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy.It was “totally unacceptable” that private nursing homes discriminate against people in their care, she said.In a parliamentary reply on the issue, Minister of State for Health Jim Daly said a person’s eligibility for medical card services was not affected by being in a nursing home.But he said it was very important that the taxpayer would “not end up paying for the same service twice”.And for this reason medication and aids “that are already prescribed for iniduals under an existing scheme are not included in the services” and are not covered under the Fair Deal.Ms Munster said “this does not make sense because a person’s rights and entitlements are the same whether they are at home or in a public or private nursing home”.She asked: “Is it the case that private nursing home contracts are given supremacy over the law of the land?”Ms Munster added that residents or their family members were receiving “strongly worded letters” demanding payment when they were entitled to receive these items and services free of charge as medical card holders.“When family members have complained, they have been told to go elsewhere if they don’t like the charges,” she said. Mr Daly said, however, that nursing homes “have an open culture with regard to the receipt of concerns and complaints” and there were robust rules about dealing with them, where residents “must not be adversely affected” as a result. If an issue could not be resolved with the nursing home, the Office of the Ombudsman could investigate.Private nursing homes have been repeatedly criticised for charging “top-up” fees of €100 and more a month for social, occupational therapy programmes.But Mr Daly of the NHI said the narrow definition of goods and services under the Fair Deal scheme and the fees paid to nursing homes “do not encompass the reality of the health and social care costs incurred to meet the day-to-day care and living requirements of persons requiring nursing home care”.The NHI chief executive also said in a statement that numerous statutory agencies had “all highlighted the discriminatory practice operated by the HSE with regard to provision of such services for residents in private and voluntary nursing homes”.The Public Accounts Committee held hearings last year on the Fair Deal scheme, where the State provides financial support to residents in nursing homes. In its report published last month it noted the comments of a senior HSE official that a person in a nursing home with 24-hour care is considered less of a risk than a person who might be residing alone in their home. “As medical card services are a scarce resource, there may not be sufficient capacity to provide the services for everyone, and the assistant national director indicated that some prioritisation must take place.”The committee noted that from a budget of about €1 billion for the Nursing Home Support Scheme, about two-thirds was expended on public nursing homes that provided one-fifth of capacity.

Photograph: Jesse DittmarNew York TimesRoger Stone has always lived in a dog-eat-dog world. So it was apt that he was charged with skulduggery in part for threatening to kidnap a therapy dog – a fluffy, sweet-faced Coton de Tuléar, belonging to Randy Credico, a New York radio host.Robert Mueller believes that Credico, a pal of Julian Assange, served as an intermediary with WikiLeaks for Stone. Mueller’s indictment charges that Stone called Credico “a rat” and “a stoolie” because he believed that the radio host was not going to back up what the special counsel says is Stone’s false story about contacts with WikiLeaks, which disseminated Russia’s hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.As the owner of two Yorkies, Stone clearly knows how scary it is when a beloved dog is in harm’s way. When he emerged from court on Friday, he immediately complained that FBI agents had “terrorised” his dogs when they came to arrest him at dawn at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.The last thing Stone posted on Instagram before his arrest was a video of a terrier, with a high-pitched voice-over, protesting, “Roger Stone did nothing wrong.”Always bespoke and natty, living by the mantra that it’s better to be infamous than never famous, Stone looked strangely unadorned as he came out of court to meet the press in a navy polo shirt and blue jeans.As the master of darkness who had been captured in darkness stepped into the bright light of Fort Lauderdale, he was his usual flamboyant, unapologetically meretricious self. He proclaimed his innocence, flashed the Nixon victory sign and reiterated the old saw from his mentor, Roy Cohn, that any attention is good attention.But it fell flat. Being Roger Stone had finally caught up with him.He has always said Florida suited him because “it was a sunny place for shady people” borrowing a Somerset Maugham line. But now the cat’s cradle of lies and dirty tricks had tripped up the putative dognapper. And it went down on the very same day that Paul Manafort – his former associate in a seamy lobbying firm with rancid dictators as clients, and then later his pal in the seamy campaign of Donald Trump – was also in federal court on charges related to the Mueller probe. Manafort’s hair is now almost completely white.One of Stone’s rules – along with soaking his martini olives in vermouth and never wearing a double-breasted suit with a button-down collar – is “Deny, deny, deny.” But his arrest for lying, obstructing and witness tampering raised the inevitable question about his on-and-off friend in the White House, the man who is the last jigsaw-puzzle piece in the investigation of Trumpworld’s alleged co-ordination with Russia: Is being Donald Trump finally about to catch up with Donald Trump?Stone, who famously has Nixon’s face tattooed on his back, is the agent provocateur who is the through line from Nixon, and his impeachment, to Trump, and his possible impeachment.As Manafort said in the 2017 documentary Get Me Roger Stone, Trump and Stone “see the world in a very similar way”. And that way is theatrical and cynical. Do whatever you have to do to get what you want playing by the rules is for suckers.In 1999, when I went on a trip to Miami to watch Trump test the presidential waters, Stone orchestrated Trump’s Castro-bashing speech to Cuban-Americans. The bodybuilding, swinging strategist, christened “the state-of-the-art sleazeball” by the New Republic in the 1980s, said he was “a jockey looking for a horse”.Stone, who was mixed up in Watergate at the tender age of 19, “made the transition from the Stone Age of dirty tricks to today”, as David Axelrod puts it.He watched Nixon rally the silent majority with a law-and-order message and racial dog whistling. He helped Ronald Reagan create Reagan Democrats.For decades, believing “past is prologue”, Stone urged Trump to be the successor to those pols, revving up angry, white working-class voters who felt belittled or scared of “the other”. It would be so easy to ide and stoke resentment, as Stone and Trump proved when they inflamed the birther controversy against Barack Obama.“Hate is a stronger motivator than love,” Stone told the documentarians. “Human nature has never changed.”The tribal tensions in America made Stone’s favourite tricks easier than ever he didn’t have to operate in the shadows. He wore a T-shirt with Bill Clinton and the word “Rape” at 2016 campaign rallies. As Stone boasted in the documentary, his “slash-and-burn” tactics “are now in vogue”.Trump has had periods of estrangement with Stone. In 2008, in an interview with the New Yorker, he called the strategist “a stone-cold loser”, a state Trump himself has been relegated to this past week, courtesy of Nancy Pelosi.Stone will not go gently. When he is asked about the tattoo of Nixon, he says he got it to remind himself, “A man is not finished when he is defeated he is only finished when he quits.”At the moment, though – dogged by Mueller – Stone and Manafort are the dog’s breakfast. The pair have given practising the dark arts a bad name."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

A common way to cover up the messy process of (de)construction. The housing development claims to be affecting time and space, moving people into new places and better futures, fundamentally altering their existenceThe figures follow research from Lloyds Bank which showed that UK firms ramped up stockpiling in the final quarter of last year. The bank said the increase in stockpiling efforts was caused by the threat of shortages and disruption posed by Brexit. UK Finance also released data on household lending and spending in 2018. Credit card spending rose to £11bn in December, up 8.8 per cent on the same month in 2017.Eric Leenders, the trade group’s managing director for personal finance, said this rise in spending was “largely offset by increased cardholder repayments, with almost half of cards not bearing any interest at all”. “This reflects the growing trend of consumers using credit cards as a preferred payment method rather than as a means of borrowing, in order to take advantage of additional protections and value-added benefits,” he added.

He also warned that “the recovery in mortgage approvals once Brexit uncertainty has faded likely will be lacklustre”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Six commercial operators added their voice.The hearings on the new bylaw are set for August 2019. In the meantime, there are no rules.Limiting Airbnb to some version of its initial ideal of “home sharing” is crucial.In 2018, 16 per cent of Toronto Airbnb hosts controlled 38 per cent of the listings, and the problem is worsening, with some downtown condos having hundreds of units listed on Airbnb, according to the Fairbnb report. The study concludes that Airbnb is responsible for countless illegal “ghost hotels”.What’s more, the report notes that if Toronto’s new rules were to come\u0026nbspinto force, more than 8,200 listings would have to be removed, and up to 6,500 whole homes would be available to boost the supply of\u0026nbsplong-term family rental housing.Toronto’s inability to set and enforce policy is not unusual. Some cities, especially in Europe, place a limit of\u0026nbsp90 days per year\u0026nbspon such rentals (Toronto’s limit is 180 days).Usually, licensing is also required.\u0026nbspThere’s also a municipal tax in some cities, similar to a hotel room tax. Licences vary in price — some are as expensive as taxi licences in the pre-Uber days and some are much cheaper.But licensing is essential for any regulation to work. Cities can only police the illegal use of properties if the name of the owner and their address and contact details are in a city database.Barcelona and Berlin have set up\u0026nbspserious regulatory systems\u0026nbspthat begin, as they must, by collecting data about the host and can result in fines of half a million euros.The top Airbnb holiday homes to book for 2019Israel threatens to slap high taxes on Airbnb after settlements banAirbnb to remove listings in Israel’s West Bank settlementsCouple’s LA holiday ruined when Airbnb ‘superhost’ attacks themShocked couple find hidden camera in AirbnbThat decision may be overruled, since all types of licences require a public body to collect and store information about the licensee. But in the meantime, the city of New York has had its hands tied as it tries to limit the negative impact of Airbnb on housing availability and prices.So if cities are having trouble limiting the undesirable effects of short-term rentals, who else could help?In cities like Toronto and Vancouver, the obvious answer is condo boards. Unlike cities, condo boards can force homeowners to put up curtains or blinds of a specific colour, never mind outlawing Airbnb rentals. However, bans are not easily enforced in large buildings with many absentee unit owners.And new condo buildings in Toronto are a particular problem. They usually come with a founding bylaw that allows short-term rentals. A bylaw is not like a rule about curtain colours: It can only be changed by a supermajority of 80 per cent or even 90 per cent of owners. It only takes a few folks renting on Airbnb to\u0026nbspfoil their neighbours.After researching the toothless regulations Canadian cities have placed on Uber, I concluded that municipal licensing bodies are not suited to limiting the economic and social damage\u0026nbspcaused by what I call “cowboy e-capitalism.” My chapter\u0026nbspin the book\u0026nbspLaw and the “Sharing Economy”\u0026nbspdelves into the issue.Cities have neither the legal powers nor the enforcement capacity needed to regulate transnational giants.\u0026nbspRedefining “ride-sharing” as a public utility, thus making it a state responsibility, is what allowed California to put rules in place that protect Uber drivers while promoting the public interest.Similarly, in Canada and elsewhere, Airbnb has been seen as a problem for municipal licensing bodies. But the threat it poses is to housing, which is a fundamental issue for higher levels of government.In Canada, cities could do more,\u0026nbspas Barcelona is doing.But given how difficult it has proved for municipalities all over the world to try to regulate this powerful transnational company, it is time for citizens to demand that provincial governments take their housing policy seriously and use their considerable planning powers to limit short-term rentals.Mariana Valverde is an urban law and governnace infrastructure researcher and professor of socio-legal studies at the University of Toronto.

During the last global recession there was a failure among world leaders to coordinate a global fiscal response of sufficient proportions, which meant the world’s major central banks had to do the heavy lifting with extraordinary monetary policies, in the form of record low interest rates and quantitative easing (QE).\u0026nbspQE involved central banks creating\u0026nbsp trillions of dollars worth of new money ‘out of thin air’ to buy up assets from the financial sector. This flow of new money into financial markets had the effect of re-inflating asset prices, which had collapsed during the financial crisis, and increasing liquidity in order to get banks lending again.\u0026nbspThe problem was that rather than using this new money to lend productively, banks predominantly stuck to the easy-profit route of bidding up property prices. In an ultra-low interest rate environment financial firms have also engaged in ever-riskier lending in the pursuit of higher yields. The result is reinflated asset bubbles and collateralised loan obligations to over-indebted companies, which echo the subprime lending behind the last crisis.QE also had dramatic implications for inequality. All of this new money flooding into financial markets pushed up asset prices, meaning a big payoff for their wealthy owners. The Bank of England, which has created £445bn through QE, estimates that its policies made the top 10 per cent\u0026nbspof households wealthier by £350,000 each. Meanwhile, the asset-poor were left with little more than the fairytale of trickle down economics.The billionaires of Davos are a painful symptom of inequalityThe rise of ‘pauper’s funerals’ is a sad reminder of UK inequalityBoE should wind down its balance sheet early, says Ian McCaffertyGeorge Osborne says the Bank of England\u0027s QE makes the rich richerAll this is not to say that central bankers should have kept their hands clean. Central banks were forced to ramp up monetary policy as politicians shied away from their responsibilities to manage the economy with appropriate fiscal policy, instead opting to counter-intuitively cut for growth\u0026nbspthrough austerity. With central bankers limited by time and by mandate, the first round of QE can be seen as a ‘necessary evil’ - doing nothing would have only deepened the recession.But there should be no such excuses when the next downturn arrives. Further attempts to stimulate the economy through QE-fuelled asset price inflation will have diminishing returns, only creating more bubbles and further widening inequality.A sustainable recovery will only come from policies which stimulate demand in the real economy. This is something which QE could be redesigned for.Central banks’ power to create new money, as demonstrated by QE, is a powerful tool that must be put to much better uses.\u0026nbspThis is an idea which has been put on the table in the UK. In the US rising Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and in France Nicolas Hulot, who resigned from Macron’s government, are also displaying the bold thinking required with their calls for a Green New Deal a massive programme of spending on green jobs and infrastructure, which could be financed by central bank money creation.But Green New Deals and other alternatives to QE will be most effective if there is an element of coordination between countries. Firstly, on a technical level, for any country other than the United States, creating vast sums of new money while foreign central banks keep a tight monetary policy could lead to unwanted pressure on their currency.But perhaps more importantly, the problems facing humanity, from climate change to spectacular inequality, are not limited to one country and cannot be solved by one country alone.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Deposits held by UK non-financial companies grew by 3.5 per cent in the year to December 2018, with the wholesale and retail, transport, electricity, and gas and water sectors all recording higher annual growth. Stephen Pegge, managing director, commercial finance at UK Finance, said the figures suggested “firms are preparing for uncertain trading conditions by building up their cash reserves”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe data also showed that lending to manufacturing grew by 8.4 per cent in the year to December, compared with a 0.3 per cent drop among UK businesses overall. “This may in part be driven by manufacturing businesses stockbuilding in the face of ongoing economic uncertainty,” Mr Pegge said.Created with Sketch.

A common way to cover up the messy process of (de)construction. The housing development claims to be affecting time and space, moving people into new places and better futures, fundamentally altering their existenceThe figures follow research from Lloyds Bank which showed that UK firms ramped up stockpiling in the final quarter of last year. The bank said the increase in stockpiling efforts was caused by the threat of shortages and disruption posed by Brexit. UK Finance also released data on household lending and spending in 2018. Credit card spending rose to £11bn in December, up 8.8 per cent on the same month in 2017.Eric Leenders, the trade group’s managing director for personal finance, said this rise in spending was “largely offset by increased cardholder repayments, with almost half of cards not bearing any interest at all”. “This reflects the growing trend of consumers using credit cards as a preferred payment method rather than as a means of borrowing, in order to take advantage of additional protections and value-added benefits,” he added. UK firms ramp up stockpiling over Brexit disruption fears, survey saysAirline meals being stockpiled as travel industry braces for BrexitManufacturers stepped up stockpiling in December, survey revealsNo more space to stockpile food \u0027as Amazon may have booked it up\u0027I\u0027m not worried we\u0027re stockpiling Brexit food – if anything, I\u0027m gladMeanwhile, while mortgage lending rose 4.7 per cent in December to £21.1bn, the number of mortgages approved that month was down 2.4 per cent compared with one year earlier. “We know from the experience before the 2016 referendum, however, that political uncertainty can have a big impact on lending,” said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He also warned that “the recovery in mortgage approvals once Brexit uncertainty has faded likely will be lacklustre”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Currently WhatsApp users are not required to provide their name or any other identifying information beyond their phone number to use the messaging app.Merging with Facebook Messenger and Instagram could force WhatsApp users to reveal information about themselves that they would prefer to keep private.Data privacy expert Tim Mackey, who works at the software firm Synopsys, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat Facebook should take considerable care in how the integration ws handled given the firm\u0027s spotty history with user privacy.Merging personal information and privacy configurations from three significant applications won’t be trivial, he said. Facebook development teams would do well to look at this precedent and prioritise user privacy.With the integration project currently expected to take a year to complete, and with end-to-end encryption as part of the plan, we should expect the Facebook engineering teams to focus attention on uniform data security both in their platform and in the apps themselves.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In Settings, hit the Privacy tab. From here, you can control who gets to see your future posts and friends list. Choose from Public, Friends, Only Me and Custom in the dropdown menu.Annoyingly, changing this has no effect on who’s able to see your past Facebook posts. Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up.39 Make yourself harder to findYou can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps. The list might be longer than you expected it to be. It’s worth tidying this up to ensure things you no longer use lose access to your personal information. 89 Change your ad preferencesYou can view a list of everything Facebook thinks you’re into and tinker with your ad preferences by going to Settings and Adverts. A lot more information is displayed on the desktop site than the app, so we’d recommend doing this on a computer.99 Download your dataFacebook lets you download all of the data it has on you, including the posts you’ve shared, your messages and photos, ads you’ve clicked on and even the IP addresses that are logged when you log in or out of the site. It’s a hell of a lot of information, which you should download to ensure you never over-share on the social network again.19 Lock your profile downIf you haven’t done this already, do it now.

It’s a hell of a lot of information, which you should download to ensure you never over-share on the social network again.It means in practise that, for instance, someone who only uses WhatsApp will be able to send an encrypted message to another person who only uses Facebook. That hasn\u0027t ever been possible before.At the moment, the three are entirely separate. Though they are all developed by the same company, and so share some data between themselves and work together, they are in practise three different apps that can\u0027t talk to each other.But this state of affairs has been gradually changing, even before this news. WhatsApp years ago started sharing data with Facebook, and the founders of both WhatsApp and Instagram have left the company in recent months amid suggestions they were concerned about their apps being subsumed into the parent company.Mark Zuckerberg hopes the decision will make each of the apps more useful, according to the original\u0026nbspNew York Times\u0026nbspreport. That in turn should make people engage with them more – and potentially encourage them to stop using rivals, like Apple\u0027s iMessage.“We want to build the best messaging experiences we can and people want messaging to be fast, simple, reliable and private, a Facebook spokesperon said.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks. As you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work.”In short, Facebook believes the combined infrastructure will make the apps better, and therefore more likely to be used that, in turn, will help generate more of the data and advertising opportunities that Facebook relies on to make its money. But there might be other less obvious reasons to bring the three together, as well.Until now, the apps have been kept separate, and so the data they each collect has been partly compartmentalised too.People have also been able to share different data with the companies themselves. WhatsApp only requires a phone number for people to use it, allowing them to stay relatively anonymous if they wish on Facebook, people have to use their real name and are asked to give over far more personal information.Many people choose to share more on WhatsApp or even entirely forego Facebook, because the latter has always had a more lax approach to people\u0027s personal data. WhatsApp has repeatedly stressed how important it is safeguard people\u0027s privacy – but that was largely led by its founders, who have left the company, and is thought to be getting eroded as it is subsumed by Facebook.\u0026nbspIn short, the move could be a concern for anyone who prefers to keep their data separate – and away from Facebook. The sense of having some contacts, information or messages safe on WhatsApp and away from its owner, or vice versa, will be lost.It\u0027s possible that same data will be used for advertising, and there have already been rumours about WhatsApp using information for marketing or showing ads within the app itself. No final decision on how the integrated services will be monetised has been decided yet, the\u0026nbspNew York Times\u0026nbspreported.Regulators are likely to share those concerns, and it\u0027s almost certain there will be yet more questions about whether Facebook should be more restrained than it is now.Facebook is still in the early stages of the work, according to the reports. But the plan is set to be finished by the end of this year or the beginning of 2020.As with most Facebook projects, the rollout will probably be small at the beginning and gradually take place across users. It\u0027s likely that such a major update will be made available to a small number of beta testers initially before being added in stages.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Perhaps, but it would be unwise to read too much into it.Markets\u0026nbspmight simply be wrong about the likely outcome.\u0026nbspWe often talk about markets as if they are definable, tangible entities but in reality they are huge numbers of companies, investors, traders and brokers buying and selling to each other.\u0026nbspThe price of the pound is an aggregation of millions of transactions between those participants. More sellers and the price will go down, more buyers it will go up simple supply and demand.While many of these participants have a significant financial interest in correctly predicting the movement of currency values, they frequently get things wrong.Banks spend vast sums applying statistical models and researching down to the tiniest detail in order to get an edge in currency markets.But that doesn’t necessarily mean they have any special information that allows them to predict the outcome of a political process that, it is fair to say, has been less than smooth.The report on the DUP that has helped boost the pound wasn’t special insider knowledge obtained only by financial institutions it was printed in The Sun.The Brexit referendum itself is a clear example of currency markets being a poor predictor of a political event. The pound suffered its biggest single-day plunge ever on 24 June precisely because most market participants thought the UK would vote to remain.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney being interviewed by host Andrew Marr on the BBC1 current affairs programme, Simon Coveney told the Show that the EU would not ratify a Brexit deal without a backstop.Michael Russell, the Scottish government\u0027s minister with responsibility for Brexit negotiations attends a Rally for Europe at Augustine United Church in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Counter-demonstrators also staged a march in London todayIf they had predicted it correctly, the decline in sterling would have taken place before the vote\u0026nbspand not have been so painfully sudden.The 2016 vote was a simple binary choice on which there had been reams and reams of polling. The current political situation is anything but. It has many potential outcomes, none of which seem to be truly understood, even by some of the MPs arguing for them.On balance, have we benefited from being in the EU?The second reason not to set too much stall by\u0026nbspthe currency market as a political sage is that there are a host of other factors beyond politics that affect exchange rates.\u0026nbspInterest rates are the most obvious and closely correlated. A higher return\u0026nbspattracts foreign investment, pushing\u0026nbspup demand for the pound and therefore the price.Which leads to a related point: currencies are always priced in pairs. Pound v dollar, euro v ruble etc.So if demand for the other currency in that pair increases, the pound will suffer a relative decline.On Friday, the pound rose 0.7 per cent against the dollar but fell slightly against the euro. Events in Europe had strengthened the single currency, events that had nothing to do with the Brexit saga.\u0026nbspWhile it would be nice to have a handy index illuminating the road ahead, the value of the pound is only of marginal use in this regard.In other words, when it comes to Brexit, it’s still anybody’s guess.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

It was designed around British red lines.“Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement is part of a balanced package that isn’t going to change.”The backstop arrangement – to prevent a hard border being implemented on the island of Ireland – comes into play if the UK cannot agree a future trade deal with the EU by December 2020, potentially locking Britain into an indefinite customs union.Created with Sketch.Brexit betrayal march in London Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester carrying a noose at the Brexit betrayal march.

three separate attempts to\u0026nbspredraft leader’s strategy so it\u0026nbspties party unambiguously to giving UK a second voteClick to followIndy PoliticsJeremy Corbyn faces a revolt from Labour MPs backing a new Brexit referendum, who will launch a drive to rewrite his proposals for the next phase of withdrawal.The move from three MPs to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a Final Say referendum, once again thrusts the party’s deep Brexit isions into the spotlight.Hours earlier four other Labour MPs had joined Tory counterparts at a press conference, with one accusing Mr Corbyn of “standing in the way” of a people’s vote.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWhile Mr Corbyn’s office declined to comment on Thursday, the leader’s social media outriders launched a counter-attack on the Labour rebels whom they accused of dishonesty.Meanwhile doubt has emerged over the viability of a cross-party push by MPs to delay the UK’s withdrawal in order to avoid leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March.No-deal Brexit would be ‘betrayal’ of what was promised, says HammondAnd in Davos, chancellor Philip Hammond warned that a no-deal Brexit – something Theresa May has refused to rule out – would be a “betrayal” of the 2016 referendum result, underlining the split\u0026nbspat the heart of the Conservative cabinet.On Tuesday Ms May will give a statement and table a motion setting out the next steps of her Brexit plan, but because of previous measures approved in the Commons, all MPs will also be able to table amendments containing proposals for what they think the government should do next.Mr Corbyn has already submitted the Labour Party’s amendment, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign for a fresh referendum because it failed to fully commit the party to backing one.It would require ministers\u0026nbspto find time for MPs\u0026nbsponly to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.But The Independent understands three Labour MPs – Ian Murray, Angela Smith and Mike Gapes – have now taken the unusual step of tabling amendments to their own party leader’s amendment, in a bid to remould Mr Corbyn’s approach so it backs a new vote immediately.Mr Murray’s would commit the government to holding a referendum offering a choice between a Brexit deal that guarantees “full participation in the single market”, as previously promised by Labour, and remaining in the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote:

opportunity to have a final say” on leaving the EU, while Ms Smith’s would see ministers legislate for a vote on “whether or not the UK should leave”.The Independent has run its own Final Say campaign to try and secure a new referendum, with more than 1.1 million people having signed the petition.While neither Mr Corbyn’s amendment, nor the three amendments to it, stand much chance of being passed in\u0026nbspthe Commons, the joint push from Labour MPs speaks to a growing frustration on the party’s backbenchers over the ambiguity of the leader’s position as the Brexit clock ticks down to 29 March.At an event on the steps of parliament earlier in the day Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Is Brexit causing hundreds of companies to leave the UK?Ford warns no-deal Brexit would cost it $800m this year, report says Jeremy Corbyn, help give the British people a Final Say over BrexitLuciana Berger\u0026nbspsaid: “Regrettably the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy and yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Chuka Umunna, who was also at the event, argued that party politics should take a back seat, saying: “The choice is stark and there is no way of escaping from it or postponing making a decision because we are out of time – do you want to facilitate some form of Brexit or give people the power to stop it?”\u0026nbspMeanwhile,\u0026nbspChris Leslie told The Independent: “There really isn’t any excuse now for Labour not fulfilling the conference promise for a people’s vote. An election hasn’t been triggered, so we should be at that stage now.”Polling indicates Labour voters and members are in favour of a new vote, but the leadership has had to walk a fine line with many constituencies in heartland areas having heavily backed Brexit.A separate group of Labour MPs strongly oppose a new referendum, including frontbencher Melanie Onn, who wrote to her constituents saying she would quit her role in Mr Corbyn’s top team if the leadership did back a new vote.Following the event in the morning Corbyn-backing commentator Paul Mason said the intervention was “daft”, and accused the Labour rebels of “preparing a doomed centrist party”.Columnist Owen Jones argued that a second referendum amendment would not get through because Labour MPs in Leave seats and Tory MPs would oppose it.He added, addressing Mr Umunna on Twitter: “You either don’t know the facts or you’re being dishonest. Which is it?”The amendment that seems most likely to get thorough the Commons on Tuesday is that written by Labour’s Yvette Cooper, with cross-party backing, that seeks to extend Article 50, delaying Brexit to avoid a no-deal scenario.But concerns have emerged that legislation it requires to enact its aim\u0026nbspcould get bogged down and even blocked outright in the House of Lords.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

10\u0026nbsppercentage points in a year.At the same time the group’s desire to see a new referendum take place on the outcome of Brexit has risen as the clock ticks down to 29 March.For exclusive

faces Brexit revolt from MPs backing second referendumThe poll commissioned by the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) comes after a cross-party group of MPs, including several from Labour, accused Mr Corbyn of “standing in the way of the younger generation having a say” on Brexit.The MPs announced last week that they would not bring forward a new referendum proposal for the Commons to vote on this Tuesday, because without Mr Corbyn’s direct support it would have no chance of success.This week Ms May will seek support in the Commons for an attempt to go back to Brussels and renegotiate the deal she has already agreed with the EU, in particular seeking changes to the Irish backstop –\u0026nbspthough European figures have ruled out any concessions.The poll carried out for HEPI by YouthSight found that backing for Labour among a weighted sample of more than 1,000 undergraduates was at just over half, with some 52 per cent saying they would vote for Mr Corbyn’s party.But this was down by 10 percentage points on the same survey undertaken just over a year ago in December 2017, when 62 per cent said they would back Labour.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing

rivals – backing among students for the Conservatives fell one point, from 14 per cent to 13 per cent, and for the Lib Dems, it rose one point from 7 per cent to 8\u0026nbspper cent.But the sizeable fall will not go unnoticed for a party that prides itself on representing the views of young people looking for a better future.This could leave Corbyn unable to guarantee the student vote to the same levels which boosted his result in the last general electionAt the same time the poll showed that students had increasingly strong feelings on Brexit and the need for the country to have a people’s vote to determine its path – less\u0026nbspthan half of those questioned, some 43 per cent, were old enough to vote at the last referendum in 2016.The survey showed that 69 per cent of the group now backed giving the British public a Final Say on the outcome of Brexit, compared to 62 per cent who wanted a new vote in December 2017.Rachel Hewitt, director of policy and advocacy at HEPI, said: “While students generally continue to be both pro-Remain and supportive of the Labour Party, these results suggest Labour’s current position over Brexit may have cost them some support among students.“This could leave Corbyn unable to guarantee the student vote to the same levels which boosted his result in the last general election.”17bn already ripped out of UK public purse due to

margin.Brexiteers angry over electoral watchdog plan for prosecution powersMinister fails to totally rule out martial law after no-deal BrexitMinisters say no-deal must stay ahead of commons battle to

critical of moments,\u0026nbspthe ripples of which will be felt most keenly by my generation. The best way to do this is to support a people’s vote on the Brexit deal, and to truly give us a final say.”The fall in student support for Labour could be explained by several different reasons, but the concurrent rise in support for a new vote just as Mr Corbyn’s own MPs accuse him of prevarication over the issue is stark.At an event on the steps of parliament last week Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Luciana Berger, a former shadow health minister,\u0026nbspsaid: “Regrettably the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy and yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Three of Mr Corbyn’s MPs later moved in parliament to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a new referendum.The leader has already submitted the Labour Party’s own amendment setting out how he thinks the country should proceed, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign because it failed to fully commit the party to backing a new referendum.Mr Corbyn’s approach would require ministers to find time for MPs only to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.The Labour Party has been contacted for comment.HEPI sponsored Wave 5 of the HEPIYouthSight Monitor, which was answered by 1,048 full-time undergraduate students and undertaken between 4-8\u0026nbspJanuary.

The IPC defended its decision to award the games to Malaysia in the first place saying it had been given assurances by the country’s Paralympic Council that all eligible athletes would be allowed to compete in host city Kuching.But a change of government in the intervening two years has resulted in the 93-year-old hardliner Mahathir Mohamad – who has regularly been accused of antisemitism – coming to power.Malaysia’s ruling party ousted for first time in country’s historySyed Saddiq, Malaysia’s minister of youth and sports under the new ruler, defended his country’s decision.“If hosting an international sporting event is more important than standing up for our Palestinian brothers and sisters who get murdered, maimed and tortured by the Netanyahu regime, that means Malaysia has truly loss its moral compass,” he said in a statement. “Malaysia stands firm with our decision on the ground of humanity and compassion for the Palestinian plight. We will not compromise.”Israel itself condemned the actions as “shameful”.The championships – which will see 600 swimmers competing from 60 different nations – were due to run from 29 July to 4 August.The IPC said it was “confident” they will go ahead in a new host city on roughly the same dates.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At least one of them needs to pass.If one does get the support of a majority of MPs, then Theresa May can go back to Brussels and say, look, this is what will get the deal through my parliament.It will strengthen her negotiating hand, make the EU engage and give her a chance of securing some changes.As one secretary of state says: “She needs to demonstrate she can carry something through.”No insiders tell me that May will only go back to Brussels “when we have a very clear set of proposals”. Butnone of these amendments can muster a majority, then the EU will just sit tight.It knows this parliament is fiercely opposed to No Deal and so isn’t concerned that the UK will actually go down that route.Instead, the EU will wait, confident that the UK will request either an extension to the Brexit process or a softening of it.So far, there are a iety of amendments down. One from the shop steward of backbench Tory MPs, Graham Brady, says the Commons will support the withdrawal agreementthe backstop is replaced by “alternative arrangements” to prevent a hard border in Ireland.Another from the Tory chairman of the Northern Ireland Select Committee, Andrew ­Murrison, seeks to time-limit the backstop. Influential cabinet ministers have also been pushing for the Government to put down its own amendment.They are confident that they are winning that argument and one will go down before Tuesday — though some in Number  still prefer to put their faith in the Murrison amendment.The signicance of a Government amendment would be that Speaker John Bercow would have no choice but to call it. One indispensable minister involved in these discussions tells me: “A Government amendment could well be a more objective exit mechanism which would allow us to ­demonstrate that this is not going to be permanent.”The outline of this amendment has, I understand, been discussed with the DUP and ministers believe that the “likelihood” is that they will support it. But one cautions that “what may seem a given one day can suddenly unravel”.No won’t be drawn on whether a Government amendment will be tabled or not. But leading cabinet ministers are confident it will be. One says: “This is the best chance of moving everyone forward together.”One option being discussed is for a series of clear tests which,met, would allow the UK to exit the backstop. The aim is to make it clear that the EU couldn’t keep the UK — or Northern Ireland — in the backstop forever.There is also, I understand, “a parallel conversation” going on about what the EU will accept in terms of changes to the backstop. If a Government-backed amendment passed the Common it would also, in the words of one source, give the Government “half a chance of stopping Cooper-Boles”.The amendment from Labour’s Yvette ­Cooper and former Tory minister Nick Boles would require the Government to ask for an extension to Article  to avoid No Dealthe UK and the EU can’t come to an agreement.As this source points out: “Cooper-Boles does best when people think there isn’t an alternative.” There is no guarantee that a Government amendment will carry the day.“To pull this off, you need the ERGto come in behind it — and that’s quite a big ask,” says one of those intimately involved in these discussions.This source warns that “emotionally a lot of them will find it very dficult”. But these Brexiteer MPs need to realise thatnothing passes on Tuesday, then parliamentary efforts to extend Article  will gather more support.Brexit itself will be in danger and this country will end up with a super soft Andrex Brexit — or no Brexit at all.MPs should not do anything to suggest that they want to take No Deal off the table. This week, the EU and the Irish government have been all over the place about what No Deal would mean for the Irish border.The contradiction at the heart of the backstop is beginning to become apparent. It is, the EU and ­Ireland say, necessary to prevent a hard border. Butthe backstop results in there being No Deal, then it will lead to precisely what it is meant to avoid: A hard border.As this inconsistency becomes more and more obvious, there is more chance of member states pressing the EU to move on this issue.One minister who has been talking to his ­counterparts across the EU in the last few days tells me: “They’re ­definitely budging.”So, this would be precisely the wrong moment for MPs to undermine May’s negotiating position by talking about taking No Deal off the table. As one of those close to the PM puts it: “This has been a dficult week for the EU. Don’t make it easy for them.”This is one of the reasons why MPs MUST REJECT the Yvette Cooper amendment. At the moment, this amendment looks like it will probably pass. But given how many Labour MPs in leave-voting seats have qualms about it, this is far from certain.Tory MPs, let alone ministers, shouldn’t help it through as doing so would pull the rug from under the UK’s negotiating position.VENEZUELA is a sorry tale of where state socialism leads. In an oil-rich country, people are starving. It is embarrassing, and shaming, that Jeremy Corbyn’s ideological blinders mean that he can’t see what is happening there.Labour talk about opposing “outside interference” in Venezuela even as a slew of democracies in the region recognise the head of the national assembly, Juan Guaido, as the legitimate president.Labour’s opposition to outside interference puts them in the same position as Russia, China, Turkey, Bolivia and Cuba. This is the company we’d be keepingCorbyn became Prime Minister.AT Cabinet this week, Theresa May told ministers that to get the deal through she would have to go to the Commons and “present a changed backstop”.This is signicant because it is her recognising that she needs substantive – not just cosmetic – changes to the backstopshe is to get her deal through.TALK of an early election just won’t go away at Westminster. It is not that the Tories want one, but that there is a sense that the Commons is so deadlocked on Brexit that it might end up as the only option.One possible route to an election is that Yvette Cooper’s plan to extend Article  passes the Commons, a deal is then eventually agreed but can only pass with the rider that there is a second referendum. I understand that, in these circumstances, the Government would rather go for an early election.One senior Cabinet Minister says that Theresa May’s “reddest of red lines is we have to leave the EU”. A ­referendum with Remain on the ballot paper would threaten that.“Political parties ought to make sure they are ready to fight an ­election”, a member of the Tory party board tells me as he explains why they are rapidly stepping up candidate selection and the like. But I am told that “no one is planning an election”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Taxes will rise. We’ll even run out of Mars bars.But across the Atlantic, something has been ­happening that should give us all some perspective.Over the past decade, Venezuela has plunged into the abyss — but there’s been no civil war, no earthquakes or hurricanes.Just a brutal, corrupt government that has turned what was once Latin America’s richest country into a hellhole.Starvation rations plunged millions into hunger and ­malnutrition, with some resorting to eating dogs, cats, even zoo animals.People got into kne fights over the right to scavenge from a dumpster.Its economy is more than three times smaller than in . Inflation climbed into the thousands, then millions of per cent.The result has been a refugee crisis on the scale of the Syria conflict.No wonder tens of ­thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Caracas this week, declaring national assembly head Juan Guaido the legitimate president.All this is awful for the poor bloody Venezuelans.But what does it have to do with Britain The answer is that Venezuela wasn’t just a ­disaster. It was an experiment — cheered on by Jeremy Corbyn and his cronies.In , Hugo Chavez took over Venezuela.He ruled until his death in , when he was succeeded by his hand-picked protege Nicolas Maduro.Chavez modelled himself on Latin American ­revolutionaries like Fidel Castro and Simon Boli. He nationalised much of the oil industry — which dominates the ­Venezuelan economy — and imposed punitive taxes on foreign firms.He introduced price controls and later currency controls. He declared “economic war” on the “stateless ­bourgeoisie” and seized the goods of private companies he denounced as saboteurs.For Corbyn, the Chavez regime was an inspiration — a chance to see true socialism brought to le.Venezuela, Corbyn has said, “showed us that there is a dferent, and a better, way of doing things. It’s called socialism”.It wasn’t just Corbyn. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott and Corbyn’s media chief Seumas Milne have all praised the ­Venezuelan revolution.That “better way of doing things” has ruined tens of millions of lives but there has not been a hint of an apology from Corbyn.Normally, the fact that people are taking to the streets to free themselves of a vicious regime would be cheered to the rafters by the Left.Instead, there is the silence of those who find themselves ­hideously embarrassed.The few who are not ­staring at their shoes claim that Venezuela has been the ­victim of an American plot.That Maduro took, in McDonnell’s words, a “wrong turn” from Chavez’s true socialism.That it was all down to a falling oil price.Yes, Maduro took a wrong turn. But that turn was to follow the path laid out by Chavez.From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, there is a long and shabby history of British left-wingers acclaiming a workers’ paradise — only to declare, once its ­failure is clear, that it wasn’t really socialist after all.Never mind the millions of lives ruined — let’s have another go!If he became Prime ­Minister, Corbyn might not succeed in turning Britain into Venezuela. But we’d be Caracas to let him try.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After all, it is they who are willing to rip up centuries of democratic understanding and procedure to keep us locked within the European Union.So terried of Britain flourishing, free from Brussels’ dead hand, that they will happily destroy public trust in Parliament in order to succeed.We wish they shared Her Majesty’s obvious confidence in her country.As MPsto their constituencies this weekend, they will hear the same thing over and over again: deliver what we voted for.Those still hoping to delay Article  or even for a second referendum MUST realise the stakes.MARCH th should be a momentous day, our first outside the European Union.

In fact, they are tinkering at the margins with farm fertilisers and log fires instead of making the big decisions that are needed.”Mr Gove’s spokesman said last night: “Ammonium nitrate has been used in fertilisers for years. It is better for air quality as it emits less ammonia,  per cent of which comes from farming.“Labour must think they know better than the World Health Organisation, which praised our plans as ‘an example for the rest of the world to follow’.“Labour should apologise for the harm to health caused by their dash to diesel, which has directly led to breaches in air pollution limits. We’re spending £.billion to clean up their mess.”A Tory source confirmed the Home Office had cleared Mr Gove’s proposals and added: “The biggest threat to our national security is the terrorists’ friend Jeremy Corbyn.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Graeme said it should be me, but I said that he had just as much right as I did.“Then the clinic told us it could be both of us. They said that we could have half the embryos fertilised with my sperm and then half with Graeme’s sperm.We were nervous at first, but meeting Meg was like being reunited with a long-lost sister. She wrapped us both in a hug before introducing us to her adorable boys.The pair were over the moon when Meg revealed she was pregnant with twins.Meg went into labour in week  of the pregnancy and Simon and Graeme were at her side.Simon said: Graeme held her hand through it all while her mum and I stood at the other end.“It was the most amazing experience of our lives. Alexandra was born first and Calder arrived minutes later. It was just amazing to meet them at last.“When we held them the first time, we couldn’t believe that we were both daddies. It was a long way to go and do this, but it was worth it to both be able to have fathered one of the twins each.The flew home seven weeks later with the twins.Meg said: I saw Simon and Graeme’s profile on a surrogacy website and I thought they had lovely smiles. I had recently split with my partner and I wasn’t ready for another baby, so I wanted to help someone.Simon and Graeme are like brothers to me now. They call me the twins’ Tummy Mummy, which I love.“It was amazing being pregnant with embryos that they had both fathered. Science is an amazing thing.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004638554371.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"karren brady influencers dont see kids friends cash","story":"Weirdly, for those of us who grew up before the internet took off, that’s an actual job now.And who can blame people for ­saying: “‘Yes please” to money for doing not very much But there is something wrongInstagram users aren’t aware the ­celebrities they follow are being paid thousands of pounds — or even hundreds of thousands — to promote the products they are “recommending”.Advertisers know Instagram — which has a BILLION monthly users posting some million photos a day — is an incredibly powerful way of reaching young people.The more followers a star has, the greater their selling power.Kylie Jenner, who has million ­followers, is paid a whopping £, for every sponsored post.Under the  UK Consumer Protection From Unfair Trading regulations, ­celebrities paid to plug products are supposed to make that clear.But there are no simple guidelines.So while some celebs might say “sponsored” or “#ad” on a post, others are less open about it.That is why the Competition  ­Markets Authority conducted an ­investigation.And this week  British celebrities and “influencers” were found to have failed to follow consumer protection guidelines.They include singers Rita Ora and Ellie Goulding, models Alexa Chung and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and video blogger Zoella.While all agreed to change their ways, none was taken to court where they might have faced fines or even jail time.“Influencers” might say the clue is in the name. They are paid to inspire you to buy stuff.Most insist they only endorse ­products they actually believe in — and we’d all hope they take their responsibility seriously.But it is easy to see how an offer of, say, £, to endorse something they “sort of” believe in might make it harder to hang on to those principles.Equally,guidelines aren’t strictly enforced, you can understand the temptation to convey the impression that you just happen to really like a particular laxative herbal tea, say, or a moisturiser that gives you a “glow”.It’s a grey area. And you might ask why it matters.But given recent news about the ­negative impact social media can have on the mental health of young people — and young women in particular — regulation of this brave new world affects us all.I need only point to another big story this week.Schoolgirl Molly Russell was  when she took her own le after showing “no obvious signs” of severe mental health issues.Her family later found she had been viewing material on social media linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide.Her father even went as far as accusing Instagram of “helping to kill her”.Social media makes it so easy to tap into someone’s daily le, their home-decor proclivities and their innermost thoughts.The intimate nature of Instagram lets you feel like these influencers are your friends, and the products they rave about their personal ­recommendations, not the outcome of a business deal.This is a real problem. But the mistake is much harder to makeadverts are clearly labelled as such.Part of the problem is how obsessed with celebrities our young people have become.When I was growing up, my main influenceswere my parents and my friends.Now, young people are influenced by people they will never meet.Some of these people, dare I say it, are talentless nobodies.You might argue you would have to be naive not to realise they are selling you something.Perhaps young people are not as cynical as the likes of me.And that is why regulation is key.IT’S hard to sympathise with Fungi, a “star” of hit telly documentary Benefits Street, who says universal credit is “the worst thing in the world”.Tracked down by this paper, James Clarkeclaimed his monthly payments had been more than halved and the all-in-one benefit was causing “hell” for him and others like him . . . because their booze budget has been cut.Fungi was claiming £ a month to spend on food and sundries. But this was slashed to £ – which doesn’t cover the £ a month he and his partner spend on strong cider.His rent, meanwhile, is paid in full via a separate taxpayer-funded handout.Fungi also says his drinking habit means he can’t work. Sorry, what Here’s another way of looking at it. People who work for eight hours a day don’t have the time to down three litres of cider a day.If Mr Clarke got a job, he might recover some of his self-esteem – and probably save his le in the process.Just to be clear – I BELIEVE in the benefits system.But it was invented to help people get back on their feet, to help those who can’t help themselves because of illness or disability.It should be a short-term measure, not a lestyle choice.In the meantime, the rest of us go to work to pay for this man’s rent and booze.All because he can’t be bothered to sort himself out.No wonder people get angry.In fact, I suspect most readers will have steam coming out of their ears.This man must start taking responsibility for himself.I SUPPOSE it was worth a shot for Diane Abbott to complain that Fiona Bruce was “badly briefed” and that her treatment as a list on Question Time was racist.But she can’t blame Fiona for her own incompetence in answering questions – and not just on Question Time.There are so many car-crash interviews to choose from . . . although the one in which Diane suggested police officers could be paid £ a year springs to mind.WHAT a nasty piece of work Dancing On Ice judge Jason Gardiner seems.We expect the judges to give feedback.And we know it won’t all be good.But his comment to Gemma Collins last week – “We are not going to see big lts from you” – came across as body-shaming.Because his real point is that she is overweight, right It’s shocking, really. I’m surprised ITV allowed it.THE secret behind Elle Macpherson’s phenomenal bod has been revealed.In an interview, she said it all comes down to . . . late breakfasts.Hmmm. No matter when we eat breakfast, most of us will never come close to looking how she does at .Actually, forget breakfast times. What struck me is her diet seems to contain just FIVE ingredients . . . one of which is nut cheese.And the only liquid is water.Elle looks great.But by God, she must be miserable.THE Premier League’s popularity continues to soar, as a study into attendances across Europe proves.And I was immensely proud to see West Ham ranked seventh by attendance in all of Europe last year.We are up there with the Continent’s elite, in a table headed by Barcelona.And that will only get better now the capacity of the London Stadium is up to , – adding to the incredible support we get from what I believe are the league’s best fans.This week, accountancy firm EY published a report on the impact the Premier League has on our economy.It generates £.billion a year in tax for the Exchequer, supporting , jobs and contributing £.billion overall to the country’s GDP.Last season, Premier League players paid more than £billion in taxes.But never mind the money.It’s still the best league in the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These people are ­consistent and have my respect.But there are just as many who are in danger now of sitting on the fence until rigor mortis sets in, coming up with process rather than substance.They are simply hoping that others will do the dirty deed and respect the will of the people.It is also, for every Labour and Conservative MP, the manesto ­promise that we stood on at the last election. We voted for a referendum. We promised to respect the result.We got re-elected promising the same, yet Parliament continues to sit on the roundabout to nowhere.It is time to stop the shenanigans and work across the political ide to bring our country and our people together.At stake is our democracy. And in a democracy the winner prevails.Of course, in future years, people can argue that we have got it wrong and that people are entitled to change their mind. But for democracy to be true and real, we have to deliver the mandate we have been given and leave the EU on March .The referendum ided people and families, with lots of strong and dfering views. But in cherishing our democracy, we now need to come together to deliver a Brexit that respects the people’s vote and helps heal that ide.In le we have to compromise. We all have our own perfect Brexit, me included. And with ten of my colleagues we have forced through a big part of that, guaranteeing in law workers’ rights, health and safety and environmental standards. We will be competing with Europe by being the best, not by being the cheapest.I would love to have been a fly on the wall when Theresa May told union bosses that she was meeting their key demands not just with a promise but with a legal guarantee. But then she knew it was only right, because union members were the bedrock of leave voters across the country.And, I believe, we can get more in the next fortnight. A clear commitment to a once-in-a-generation investment into the Leave-voting areas that have long been starved of our fair shares — those former coal, iron and steel industrial heartlands, the unfashionable places, the areas still manufacturing. I think, as well, that union bosses and industrialists can be brought to act as advisers to the trade negotiations when we have left the EU, bringing their expertise into play to ensure a jobs-first Brexit for Britain.A country, proud and independent, standing on its own two feet, ­confident again in our democracy, bold enough to compete by being the best, British workers making high- quality products and delivering high-quality services.A country that says it will be the best by having better pay, conditions and a healthier environment than anyone  in Europe or worldwide.Is that not something to be confident in voting for, my fellow MPs  Let’s get on with it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Along with the likes of megabucks Remainers Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and PR guru Roland Rudd, he seems to think Brexiters are basically pond le.That theory should be buried forever after this weekend’s passionate plea from leading academic Sir Noel Malcolm for MPs to stop wrecking Brexit.Writing in the devoutly pro-EU Financial Times, this distinguished Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, spells out the essence of the Leave case: “Brexit is about sovereignty — and parliament must respect that.”“If the UK is now on the brink of a constitutional crisis,” he adds, “one major reason is that a signicant number of MPs still oppose any version of Brexit, and seek a second ­referendum solely for the sake of reversing the decision of the last one.”Sir Noel does not believe people voted Out because they were racist.“The most important reason was democracy,” he says.“They wanted to live under laws made by the people they elected. Immigration came second.What they objected to was a supranational government ­making some of their laws and lting all immigration controls on the inhabitants of  other countries.”Another Remainer fiction is that Brexiters are narrow-minded Little Englanders.Yet the Daily Mail found space for a German view that Brussels should stop “insulting Britain” and honour us as champions of peace in Europe.“Such blinkered and sour responses are wrong-headed,” says Alexander von Schoenburg, a senior editor of Germany’s biggest newspaper, Bild.“They ignore the great debt Germany and the whole ­Continent owes our friends across the Channel.“We must always remember that throughout your history, independence and sovereignty have been paramount.“Germany in particular should tread lightly when it comes to dealing with your proud nation. It was Great Britain that first stood up to Hitler in .And it was Britain that opened its doors to thousands of ­Jewish refugees fleeing certain death during the Holocaust.“Put simply, there would be no free Europe without you and the bloody sacrice you made to rescue the Continent.”This remarkable tribute ­follows a recent love letter to the UK from Germany’s next Chancellor calling for a friendly Brexit orce and an end to bitterness.It is now clear hardline Remainers have over-reached themselves. The worm has turned.Talk of a second referendum is dead and voters are on the warpath against MPs plotting to scupper Brexit in tomorrow’s Commons showdown.Brussels is in chaos over the Northern Ireland backstop.Michel Barnier has started muttering about new tech- nology to police post-Brexit ­frontiers — a UK idea initially dismissed as “magical thinking”.EU allies are breaking ranks to demand a decent deal — for their sake as much as ours.It is way past time now for Theresa May to scrap the backstop and tell Brussels exactly what she needs to get her deal through Parliament.“There is absolutely no truth in speculation that ­passengers are being advised not to book,” stormed Brittany Ferries as it announced plans to INCREASE services.Meanwhile, mischief-making aviation giant Airbus admits it was asked by Downing Street to warn – incredibly – that it would shut up shopBritain left without a deal.Project Fear is shameless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The evidence is so heavily weighted to involvement by one of the aircrew taking this aircraft down.“That aircraft has probably depressurised, the people died of asphyxiation, it was premeditated murder. It was highly planned. The bodies have never been found.”But despite experts’ observations, the Malaysian government, which has signed a “no cure, no fee” deal with Texas-based company Ocean Infinity to resume the hunt for the plane, remains silent on the question of Zaharie’s possible involvement.Ocean Infinity started the search on January  this year, following a failed £million search for the plane.  At the time, experts said they expected to have answers within a matter of weeks.The company has  search days to look for the plane, which has been spread over several months. Officials said there was roughly an  per cent chance of finding traces of the wreckage in a new , square mile search area.The investigation is expected to end in mid-June but those on the TV show said they feared MH may never be found."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000350868025.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"junk food firms fuelling obesity","story":"Experts say the firms are endangering the nation’s health by getting people hooked on food and drink that is high in fat and sugar.They want a global treaty that bans food firms from influencing government policy.It would open the door to a raft of nanny state measures, including higher taxes on meat and chocolate and an end to BOGOF deals.The food industry, which has previously opposed such measures, last night branded the demands extreme and deeply irresponsible.They said the best way to combat obesity is by government and industry working together to improve diets and nutrition.More than six in ten British adults are overweight or obese and a third of kids are too fat by the time they leave primary school.Being overweight increases the risk of heart disease, cancer and type- diabetes. It is thought to cost the NHS £billion a year.The Commission on Obesity, assembled by The Lancet medical journal, also wants higher fuel taxes to encourage people to walk.It says a treaty would “recognise the fundamental and irreconcilable conflict that exists between some food and drinks industries’ interests and those of public health”.The Lancet was mocked last week for claiming Brits should eat no more than a quarter a rasher of bacon and two-thirds of a fish finger a day.Prof William Dietz, from the Commission, said: “Although food clearly dfers from tobacco because it is a necessity to support human le, unhealthy food and beverages are not.“The similarities with Big Tobacco lie in the damage they induce and the behaviours of the corporations that profit from them.” Tim Rycroft, from trade body the Food and Drink Federation, said: “Drawing a comparison between tobacco and food is deeply irresponsible.“Food and drink are essential to sustain le while even the smallest dose of tobacco is harmful to health.“The food and drink industry has a proud record, working alongside Government, making positive changes to the nation’s diet, for over ten years.“It is widely acknowledged that obesity rates in the UK are too high, but that can’t change without the active partnership of industry.“Only those with the most extreme of viewpoints could believe that denying our industry a seat at the policymaking table would help to improve UK diets and nutrition.”The Commission calls for higher taxes on red meat so it becomes unaffordable for most people, causing them to eat less.They want higher levies on petrol and diesel, so people are less likely to drive and more likely to walk or use public transport.And they demand a ban on the advertising and promotion of food and drink high in fat and sugar to reduce awareness and affordability.The  of  experts, from  countries, also want health warnings on junk food, similar to those seen on cigarette packs.And they insist recipes for family favourites, such as cakes, biscuits and pizzas, are changed to make them lower in fat, sugar and salt.Companies that fail to comply must be fined for failing to hit targets, they add.The Lancet was mocked last week for saying Brits should eat no more than a quarter rasher of bacon a day.Other daily limits include two-thirds of a fish finger, a p-sized patty of beef and a quarter of a chicken breast.People would also be allowed   of a tin of baked beans and a tablespoon of olive oil a day amid claims such a lestyle would help save the planet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a series of compromises.“It was designed around British red lines.But he then displayed signs Ireland has been rattled by internal EU wrangling over the backstop in recent days.He told the Andrew Marr Show: “Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the Withdrawal Agreement is part of a balanced package that isn’t going to change.”On the same programme minutes later Mr Hancock suggested Mr Coveney was bluffing and denied Mrs May’s deal was “dead in the water”.The Health Secretary said: “That’s a negotiating position the Irish are taking, but I think it’s also extremely clear from that interview and the tone is that Ireland doesn’t want to have a no-deal Brexit.“The whole purpose of the backstop is to avoid a hard border, which risks being a consequence of a no-deal Brexit.‘The idea the EU and the Irish Government would drive this process to a no-deal exit in order to try to achieve something which is intended to avoid no-deal Brexit, that is not going to happen.”In a coded appeal to Tory Brexiteers to back Sir Graham’s plan to replace the backstop, Mr Hancock said his efforts at trying to find a solution were “extremely valuable”.He told ITV News: “The impulse behind those who’ve supported the Brady amendment I entirely understand and we need to look for a pragmatic solution.”And the Health boss said the Government was listening “very carefully” to those backing the amendment.But the proposal is one of  amendments that have so far been tabled for tomorrow’s crunch Commons showdown, which was designed to find a Brexit plan that attracts a majority of support.And it’s up to Speaker John Bercow which and how many amendments will get chosen to be voted on.The Government is expected to ask MPs to cancel their week-long February holiday in order to pass crucial Brexit legislation in time for March .And MPs will also be asked to sit for  hours a day on Tuesdays and Wednesdays over the next two months.Meanwhile it emerged yesterday that the PM’s husband Philip May has been dragged into the bitter No war over her Brexit deal.Mrs May’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell reportedly accused him of trying to “scupper” attempts to reach out to Labour in their bid to find a Commons majority for her deal after Mr May helped persuade his we that doing so would risk splitting the Tory party.But No dismissed suggestions Mr Barwell had criticised Mr May as “utter bunkum”.But sources in the hardline Brexiteer ERG group of Tory MPs said they were wary of backing the Brady amendment - because they dont believe the PM will reopen the Withdrawal Agreement.The source said: The problem is there is so little trust with the Government. Its the case over the last week that Julian has told senior ERG members that theyll reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. But theres no proof the that the EU are actually going to reopen it. Privately a lot of MPs are sceptical about whats going on. Things are quite fluid. But Im worried No arent going to come up with the goods and the ERG will be even more pissed off.In another sign of a Tory truce emerging over Brexit last night, Boris Johnson said Mrs May would win his “full-throttled” supportshe pledges toto Brussels to renegotiate the backstop.Writing in his weekly Dailycolumn the former Foreign Secretary reveals that a “very senior source” has told him that the PM is planning to ask the EU for a “freedom clause” that would allow Britain to exit the hated Irish backstop unilaterally.He said thatshe wins that concession it will deliver “unadulterated good Brexit news” that will “defuse the booby trap” of the Irish backstop and pave the way for a Canada-style free trade deal to be struck with the EU.But to gain his and his fellow Brexit rebels’ support he called on the PM to publicly reveal her plan today and reveal “exactly what the Government has asked for.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Three of the four crew members aboard the Russian Tu-M were killed in the tragic incident in the Arctic last week. During the dramatic footage - which shows the full scale of the terrying incident - the plane approaches the runway at speed and touches down. However, the aircraft bounces and starts breaking up and quickly erupts into two fireballs - one in the cockpit section which breaks away from the rest of the plane. The clip was taken at the Olenya air base above the arctic circle and clearly shows the planes heavy impact with the runway. Russian defence officials say the plane was on a training flight and was unarmed - however unconfirmed reports suggest there was a missile on board.    Reports also suggest that the commander Major Alexey Guryev lost control as he landed at a remote airbase. The damaged cockpit was later seen lying on its side in a snowfield an unknown distance from the rest of the wreckage which is visibly charred. Guryev, , died at the scene. A tribute has been set up to the captain and the two other airmen who perished in the crash - co-pilot Konstantin Mazunin and navigator Viktor Greyf. An emotional message honouring Greyf, , who died as he was rushed to hospital, was posted his teenage son on social media. Kirill, , wrote: “You are my hero! You are the very best!” Another navigator Maxim Rylkov survived the crash but was reported to be in a grave condition. Guryev - a father of one - was from a dynasty of Russian air force pilots and had followed in the footsteps of his father German.   His eight year old son was named German after his grandfather. There is implied criticism of the crew in an official accident report that leaked two days after the crash. It claimed the captain “allowed the landing of the aircraft without levelling”. The unbalanced plane then broke apart with impact and began to “destroy”, said the report. The cockpit and the rest of the aircraft which erupted in flames were detached. “The crew did not respond the commands of flight management team,” said the leaked report. “The fuselage burned down.”    There were also claims the captain insisted on landing despite being urged to use another air base. “Currently, all possible versions of the incident, including a technical mal, are being considered,” said a military source. The crash was at Olenya air base, near Olenegrosk, on the Kola Peninsula some  miles south of Murmansk city. Aviation expert Vadim Lukashevich believed that the crash was likely caused by a vertical wind gust that suddenly hit the plane before touchdown, according to the RIA Novosti news agency. Accounts at the time suggested blizzard conditions.  The Tupolev bomber - an aircraft in service since the Soviet era - can strike targets , miles from base, and is a key war plane for potential deployment against the West. It has a crew of four. The crashed aircraft was reported to be  years old. It underwent a major overhaul in .

The Shadow Education Secretarys comments emphasise a split in the Labour party on whether Jeremy Corbyn should swing behind a so-called Peoples Vote. A poll this month found % of Labour members back a new referendum. Yet only  Labour MPs have publicly demanded one and Mr Corbyn is resisting calls to back it.Instead the party is still keeping a second referendum as an option on the table.  Ms Rayner told Sky News Sophy Ridge on Sunday: I would be really worried about a second referendum to be honest.I don’t think people necessarily will expect the result they get. I thinkanything it will be very narrow. And worst case scenario is it will be a very narrow Remain. And then what  We’re going to have the best of three  Labour is seriously considering backing a bid to delay Brexit beyond March  this Tuesday night, in order to prevent a No Deal.   The Commons amendment by MP Yvette Cooper is likely to passLabour backs it. If it does, MPs would choose how long to extend Brexit for, before asking for approval from the EU. Yet Ms Rayner said: I dont think people want to see a delay in Article  [which set the date of Brexit]. She added: I think thatwe end up in a second referendum, us as politicians have failed the public. We’ve failed to be able to do our job. I will see that as a really dficult situation for us all to be in. However,there was a new vote, she added: I probably would vote Remain.   I would probably vote Remain and the reason is Ive seen over the last . years all the analysis we have got at the moment. Were in the EU, we get benefits from being part of the EU and I believe that to be the right thing for the UK. I believed that at the start of this process when I made my first vote and I still believe that to be the case. When askedLabour would back Yvette Coopers Brexit amendment, Ms Rayner signalled the party would - but onlyits the only option we have.  She said: Labour will do whatever it takes to avoid a no-deal Brexit, sothats the only option we have its something we will seriously consider. Let me be as clear as I possibly can be for the people that are listening to this programme - weve put our amendment down, weve said we respected the result of the referendum, we want to find a deal, we want a customs union, we want protection for environment, consumer, employment. Weve said that all along. Theresa May will not budge on her red lines, shes forcing us and trying to bully us into a no-deal scenario.We will do whatever it takes, through Parliament, to stop that no-deal scenario from happening. If that means backing an amendment, then we will do that.

The Republics deputy PM blasted Mrs May as it emerged shes considering backing a demand to scrap a crucial clause called the Irish backstop. The backstop is the main reason MPs defeated the -page Brexit deal by a record -vote majority this month. But now veteran MP Graham Brady is leading a group of Tories who say theyll change their mind and back the deal -the backstop is replaced with alternative arrangements. And Cabinet minister Matt Hancock has confirmed the government will listen very carefully to Sir Grahams call - whichpassed on Tuesday, would send an ultimatum to the EU to think again. But Irelands rattled Deputy PM Simon Coveney blasted the plan and claimed the EU wont accept it. “Your Prime Minister signed up to the backstop as a compromise which was designed around her and Britain’s red lines, he told the BBC.  The backstop is already a compromise. It is a series of compromises. It was designed around British red lines. Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the Withdrawal Agreement is part of a balanced package that isnt going to change.”  Mr Coveney said abandoning the backstop would mean relying on an aspirational hope with no clear image of what comes next. He added: The European Parliament will not raty a Withdrawal Agreement that doesnt have a backstop in it. Its as simple as that. The backstop is an insurance policy which would kick in on  January there is still no arrangement to keep the border open between Northern Ireland and the Republic. It would prevent ato the violence of the Troubles - but the price would be trapping the UK under EU customs rules indefinitely.  Tory MP Graham Brady has laid an amendment to Theresa Mays Brexit plans, saying the government requires the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border. The amendment by Sir Graham, chairman of the Tory backbench  Committee, is one of  being laid by MPs ahead of a vote on Tuesday. Askedthe government would back it, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC: I think we have got to listen very carefully to people who are willing to vote for the deal subject to some amendments.  And I think we need to build that majority in the Commons, clearly. And this was one of the proposals thats coming from a wide range of people who want to get a deal through and have that good future relationship. He added: “Whether it’s that exact one - we don’t know which amendments the Speaker will select and so we don’t know exactly the shape of the debate on Tuesday. “But I do understand the impulse behind those who are laying that amendment. Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns went further, demanding Theresa May bin the backstop completely. She also suggested the PM replace her chief negotiator Olly Robbins with her own husband Philip May - who reportedly urged her to keep going with her deal.  But Mr Coveney suggested binning the backstop had no chance of success in the EU. He said: There are ways of resolving these issues - in my view, by changing the aspirations in the future relationship declaration which in my view will reassure people that the backstop is never likely to be used. That is the way I hope these negotiations will go, rather than the British Parliament deciding on something that may command a majority in Westminster but has no chance of getting agreement or ratication in the EU. Ireland’s Europe Minister Helen McEntee added: To suggest that we would compromise on the Irish backstop is suggesting that we would compromise on the leading requirement ensure that we protect the peace that we’ve had for the past  years. To put a unilateral clause in a backstop, to put a time limit on the backstop, it ceases to become a backstop or it ceases to be a backstop”. Despite Irelands comments, government sources and Mr Hancock suggested there was still wriggle room around removing the current backstop - as long as it gets a smart replacement. Mr Hancock denied Mr Coveneys comments meant Theresa Mays Brexit deal was dead in the water, saying: Not at all. He added: Thats a negotiating position the Irish are taking, but I think its also extremely clear from that interview and the tone... is that Ireland doesnt want to have a no-deal Brexit. The whole purpose of the backstop is to avoid a hard border, which risks being a consequence of a no-deal Brexit. The idea the EU and the Irish Government would drive this process to a no-deal exit in order to try to achieve something which is intended to avoid no-deal Brexit, that is not going to happen. Meanwhile Labour are still considering whether to back the most likely amendment to pass on Tuesday - one that would delay the  March date of Brexit. Yvette Cooper, the MP behind the bid, said today it will be up to MPs to decide how long a delay is for. The EU would still have to sign off a delay - but in a boost to the delayers, Mr Coveney said Ireland will not be an obstacle to doing that.

Six in  of those questioned said that the Government does not listen to people like them, and the figure was similar among both Leave and Remain voters. Edelmans UK and Ireland chief executive Ed Williams said the findings revealed a Disunited Kingdom where much of society feels ignored and abandoned by its political class, with Brexit at the heart of the ision.The survey of around , iniduals found a decline in trust in the leaders of both major parties. Only % said they trusted Prime Minister Theresa May to do the right thing - down from % last year - and % said the same of Jeremy Corbyn . Among Conservative supporters trust in Mrs May fell  points to % and among Labour backers trust in Mr Corbyn dropped  points to %.Some % of those questioned said they did not feel their views were represented in British politics, and the feeling was stronger among those who leant towards Labourthan those with Conservative sympathies . Seven out of  said that le is unfair, and half said the socio-political system was broken. And two-thirdssaid that the UK was on the wrong track - with Remainers far more likelythan Leaversto feel that way. Some % of Conservatives said the UK was heading in the right direction, against just % of Labour-leaning respondents. The survey revealed that trust in Britains institutions was far higheramong iniduals identied as being informed - people with college-level education, relatively high-income jobs and regular consumption of news and business media - than among the rest of the population .   The -point gap was the highest recorded by the annual survey. Nearly a thirdof those questioned said they had followed political news more since the Brexit referendum. Nearly a quartersaid they were more vocal about politics. Although % said they were fed up of hearing about Brexit, more than a thirdsaid they were reading, watching or listening to more news. Asked which institutions were the most broken, % of us chose government, compared with just % for the media, % for business and % for NGOs . Those surveyed were split on whether business was working in a way that was good for Britain, with % saying yes and % no. But three-quarters trusted their own employer to do the right thing, and more than three-quarters said chief executives should take a lead in bringing about change in areas such as equal pay, tackling discrimination and training for the jobs of the future. Mr Williams said: We are a Disunited Kingdom - a country that is seen as increasingly unfair, less tolerant and headed in the wrong direction. Brexit has exposed fractures that have split families and ided friends, made us meaner and angrier as a society, and stoked fears of violent protest and civil disorder. The isions exposed by our decision to leave the European Union are not binary. They are far more complex. But the consequences are clear - as a country we see our politicians and our political leaders as out of touch, and we lack faith in their ability to heal the ide. Instead we are looking increasingly to business and to our employers to lead and to act with social purpose.Edelman conducted online interviews with more than , iniduals in the UK between December  and January ."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin maguire dont diverted divide","story":"NewsopinionKevin Maguire: Dont be erted by ide and rule Brexit in tactic to distractIt comes amid a debate over FTSE  Fat Cats who earn salaries of £.-million a yearShareCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor:,  JAN NewsopinionThese Fat Cats aren’t worth in four days what an average worker earns in a year\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDivide and rule is the oldest trick in the reactionaries’ book – and it’s working for a loaded Brexit elite. Turning Britons against other Europeans by lying and inventing  promises,while at the same time demonising foreigners, smacks of a Right-wing plot to replace rights with a new serfdom. How much it’s a poisonous ersion by the reactionaries scheming their way to Brexit was shown when campaigning Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh detailed outrageous pay unfairnesses in a debate. Typical FTSE  Fat Cats on pound.-million aren’t worth in four days what an average worker earns in a year.  We’re going backwards when these gluttons receive  times more than a typical employee, compared with  times two decades ago. McDonagh detailed eye-watering ratios in Westminster Hall of up to  in privatised Royal Mail, Tesco , Ladbrokes’ owner , housebuilder Persimmon’s  and , at speculator Melrose Industries. The MP strikes a chord arguing a big company executive isn’t worth  police officers,  teachers,  nurses or  carers. I’ve long said a -to- ratio between highest and lowest is ample to reward ability, effort and responsibility.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn favours a doubly generous -to- for firms profiting from public contracts. The European Union didn’t block these Fat Cat bonanzas – but it does guarantee, for example, paid holidays and maternity entitlements which unchained future Tory Governments would threaten. Brexit is to Britain what Trump is to the US, chaos deliberately inflicted – and an opportunity for self-interested ideological masters to pursue naked self-interest. Boosting the incomes of Wetherspoon’s poorly paid staff isn’t Brexit pub bore Tim Martin’s priority when the skinflint, worth pound million, has criticised higher minimum wages. And James Dyson isn’t hanging around for Britain to become a new Singapore, a state without an NHS. Feathering their own nests, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage are joining the wealthy elite, not challenging it. Britain needs fundamental, dare I say revolutionary, change. Brexit is poison when we’re searching for a democratic socialist elixir.

Bristol Live reports that as a result, many participants allegedly picked up injuries.Not only was the route hazardous, they say, but the urns containing the hot water to make the hot chocolate ran out during the race. This meant that only a handful of people were able to enjoy the finishing sweet treat which defined the event. One runner told Bristol Live that a girl, aged around , slipped on a narrow path and injured her hand while another man hurt his leg after falling over. The cross country route, which had km and km versions, was completed by around  people ranging in age. Tickets to enter were pound for adults, pound. for runners aged between  to and pound for children aged between five to . But organisers have already been hit by several refund requests.   As soon as we arrived we could tell something wasnt right Cerys Nelmes, a comedian and presenter from Wotton-under-Edge, took part in the run with a group of friends who travelled up from Exeter for it. As soon as we arrived we could tell something wasnt right, the organisation was non-existent, said the -year-old. My main concern was for peoples health and safety. There were barely any marshals and everyone went the wrong way initially, which meant we had to turn back on ourselves. That then meant people who started after us ended up running into us, which created a mass of people who had no idea where to go. One of the few marshals was a young lad who didnt have a clue what he was doing and sent people the wrong way. There was nobody in high-vis at all and at one point we nearly ran through a kids football match taking place on a nearby field. Parents asked what we were doing and we told them we didnt have any idea. The arrows were just bits of A paper left on the floor and kept getting blown around in the wind as they werent pinned down. Then, at the end of the race, we were told there was no hot chocolate as the power had tripped, but evenit hadnt there definitely wasnt enough water for everyone to go around. It was utterly shambolic.  Instead of a hot chocolate I was offered a cup of marshmallows Matthew Sheppard travelled from Chippenham in Wiltshire to take part in the race, along with his we who came to watch. I would like to say it was poorly organised but that doesnt even begin to cover it, said the keen runner, aged . The safety briefing which was supposed to take place at am never happened and there was no klaxon or whistle to signal the start of the run, it just sort of started. Certain parts of the route were narrow paths with steep drops either side and there were no marshals in those areas. The so-called marshsals had nothing to identy them as that and were just completely disinterested people semi-directing people. It was ridiculous. Instead of a hot chocolate at the end I was offered a cup of marshmallows and the man who was handing out the medals was just giving them to anyone who walked past, he even offered my we one who didnt take part. It was almost asthe organiser somehow got their hands on a big box of medals and thought maybe we should put on an event. I will be chasing a refund but I cant say I have much hope.

Christened Ethel Margaret Whigham, the millionaires daughter described as a daddy’s girl with an absent father, living with a jealous mother. But in the s, her second husband Ian Campbell produced a list of  suspected lovers and stolen, graphic Polaroids of her in compromising positions with two other men. One photo showed the duchess performing a sex act on a man, whose face is not visible and there has been much speculation over the years as to his identity. Duncan Sandys, Winston Churchill’s son-in-law, actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr, and US airline executive Bill Lyons have all been in the frame.Now, author Lyndsy Spence has told Daily Record the most likely identity of the headless man was Texan millionaire Joe Thomas. The writer, , said: In many ways, Margaret was one of the first Me Too victims as her husband stole her personal property and used it to violate her in open court. Producing the Polaroid pictures and ruining her reputation was a horric and vengeful thing to do. It should never have been allowed to happen. The duke had no problem blackening her name, claiming she was having affairs with more than  men who were mentioned in her diary of engagements. Many of the men in Margaret’s diary were gay but, because in those days homosexuality was still illegal, she took the rap by staying quiet to protect them.   Margaret had married Campbell, the th Duke of Argyll, in  and he set about using her family’s millions to restore his crumbling seat – Inveraray Castle in Argyll and Bute. Their marriage was unhappy and volatile. The author, from County Antrim, Northern Ireland, added: Ian never really showed any love for her and it was clear from the outset that he only wanted her millions to do up Inveraray Castle. She was naive and was taken advantage of quite easily. The  trial ruined not only her reputation but also her le. She was viewed as a freak show and it earned her the nickname of the dirty duchess. The judge ignored the ill-gotten evidence and sided with Campbell, proclaiming Margaret to be a highly-sexed woman who had ceased to be satisfied with normal sexual relations. As a orcee, she was portrayed as a mentally unstable villain in the press and cast out from the very uppermost echelons of English society. As part of her research for the book, out on February , Lyndsy spoke to the son of Joe Thomas, who believes his father was the headless man. She said: There have been rumours over the years about who he was. In , Margaret’s stepdaughter-in-law Lady Colin Campbell claimed the duchess had told her it was American airline executive Bill Lyons but I think I have stumbled upon the most likely truth.  When I contacted the son of Joe Thomas, the New York stockbroker she fell in love with after her marriage to Charles Sweeney broke down, he told me about the Polaroids he had found in his dad’s trunk. These matched the ones Ian Campbell held up in court. The dates matched too as Margaret was in New York in  and  and Polaroid brought out their first camera in . The writer continued: Margaret was the only child of Scottish self-made millionaire George Whigham and the beautul socialite Helen Hannay. Her childhood was rich and splendid – but empty. She was a daddy’s girl with an absent father, living with a jealous mother who sought to remind her of her every shortcoming, criticising her stutter and telling her she would never amount to anything.Yearning for approval, she enjoyed the company of men and, at , she became pregnant following a tryst with actor David Niven. Her parents arranged a secret termination.Margaret died aged  in . She has been laid to rest at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey.

Shes opted for outfits which really show off her growing bump to the delight of royal fans. But many have criticised the Duchess for constantly touching and cradling her stomach. Every official engagement she attends offers countless photos of her holding her bump, leading many to ask why she cant seem to stop. But now another body language expert has revealed his theory behind it - and its all down to royal behaviour.   Harry Witchel told the Mail on Sunday : Meghan tends to cup her bump by knitting her fingers together – a sign of holding back and being more grounded. Thats quite a contrast to her usual behaviour, which involves dealing with the world with gusto. As a Royal she is expected to be more reserved, so is this a subconscious attempt to be so    This doesnt look like acting. This looks like a woman aware of a change in her body. Meghan will give birth in the spring, but her exact due date has not been made public. The new arrival will be seventh in line to the throne, but it is unlikely that the baby boy or girl will be given the title of Prince or Princess. Instead they will probably become a Lord or a Lady as they are too far down the line of succession.   Ahead of the birth Meghan and Harry will leave Kensington Palace and London and move to their new home Frogmore Cottage in Windsor. They are currently renovating the home, a present from the Queen, and getting the nursery ready for Baby Sussex . Meghan has reportedly opted for vegan paint and the design will be completely gender neutral as they dont knowtheyre having a boy or a girl.

Throughout two-year-old Finns battle with cancer Jim, , often said he wished he could trade places with the brave tot.But in a tragic twist of fate, Jims wish seemed to come true when he was taken to hospital with lung cancer in  just as Finn was winning his own battle.Jim, a veteran of the Korean War, passed away just  weeks later. Finn is now eight having battled the disease before his second birthday.Now, Bernie has written a moving poem to express her love for her dad, the Liverpool Echo reported.“He had sat on our sofa on diagnosis day and wept and said, it should have been me, I am an old man, Bernie recalled.   “It didn’t take long before I reflected on the meaning behind my dad’s diagnosis and his clear wish to trade places with Finn. Called Why Him Not Me , the poem has been entered into a competition in Liverpool as part of the th anniversary of the cancer charity Pause for Hope. “[The poem] is testament to my dad who, in the face of his terminal diagnosis, was courageous enough to know it was right he died to allow his grandson to live, Bernie said. “He took this responsibility in the same way as when a -year-old he went to Korea to serve in the forgotten war.” In another bittersweet moment, Bernie was heavily pregnant with her third son Sebastian when Jim was taken into hospital with lung cancer and gave birth on the same day Jims last battle ended and he died.

Mr Frank, , who was one of  children who survived the Theresienstadt camp in Czechoslovakia along with his two brothers, said he was surprised by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trusts findings. His father, who helped hide Jews as part of the Dutch Resistance, was arrested in Amsterdam and taken to Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland, where he was gassed on January  .   He said: In my experience, people dont have a solid understanding of what happened during the Holocaust and thats one of the reasons I am so committed to sharing what happened to me. At one of my talks, I met someone who said the Holocaust didnt happen. The only way to fight this kind of denial and anti-Semitism is with the truth - I tell people what happened, what I saw and what I experienced. Education is so important. If we ignore the past, I fear history will repeat itself. The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust surveyed , adults in the UK for the new survey. Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: We know that education is vital in the fight against ignorance and hate.   Whatever the statistics, one person questioning the truth of the Holocaust is one too many and so it is up to us to redouble our efforts to ensure future generations know that it did happen and become witnesses to one of the darkest episodes in our history. Today hundreds of people, including survivors, politicians and members of the public, will gather to mark Holocaust Memorial Day and remember its six million Jewish victims.

A national commemorative ceremony will take place in Westminster to mark the day, which is also acknowledging the th anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda and  years since the end of the genocide in Cambodia. HMDT chief executive Olivia Marks-Woldman said: The Holocaust threatened the fabric of civilisation and has implications for us all. Such widespread ignorance and even denial is shocking.   Without a basic understanding of this recent history, we are in danger of failing to learn where a lack of respect for dference and hostility to others can ultimately lead. With a rise in reported hate crime in the UK and ongoing international conflicts with a risk of genocide, our world can feel fragile and vulnerable. We cannot be complacent. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire, who will be speaking at Sundays event, said: It remains essential now as ever to remember the Holocaust, to understand why it happened and to learn the stark lessons it gives. We must never forget where hatred and bigotry can lead. He added: This Government is clear that anti-Semitism has no place in our society and we all have a role to play in confronting hatred and extremism whenever and wherever it occurs.

Operation Ritz was a perfectly planned moment which saw Prince Charles and Camilla appear together as a couple for the first time after keeping their relationship in the shadows for years. They finally made their relationship official when they stepped out of the Ritz Hotel together after celebrating the th birthday of Camillas sister Annabel Elliott on January , . The photo op was the brainchild of spin doctor Mark Bolland, who reportedly ed to the UK from LA just to oversee the operation. And it worked - and the photographs appeared on the front page of every British newspaper alongside surprisingly warm words.  Camilla arrived at the hotel at .pm with her children Tom and Laura, and the group were greeted by the hotel manager ready to start the party. Charles arrived two hours later, at about .pm, having spent the evening at a charity dinner at St Jamess Palace. He walked to the hotel through Green Park, carrying a birthday present for the host. As they left together photographers got the picture they had been waiting for for years - a snap of the couple together. Photographers took so many photos during the short appearance that the British Epilepsy Association urged broadcasters not to use the clips on TV because there were so many flashes. Mr Bolland was put in charge of dealing with the Camilla Factor since way before the death of Princess Diana.  He managed to discreetly position her under the Palace wing, and closed down major areas of risk as she got ready to step into the public spotlight, reports the Independent. Before the joint appearance there were several near misses, most of which were pulled at the last minute. The first date in the diary was a gala for the National Osteoporosis Society, in late . However Camilla cancelled it after the death of Princess Diana. They were then going to make a joint appearance at the wedding of Santa Palmer-Tomkinson - the daughter of Camillas best friend Patti - but decided it would upstage the bride and groom. So in the end they settled on Annabels private birthday, and she was reportedly delighted to help out. How the Mirror covered the story at the time CHARLES and Camilla felt an overwhelming sense of relief as they prepared to face the world together. Almost  years of secrecy was to be banished with their exit side by side from a party at Londons Ritz Hotel late last night. And hours before the dramatic moment, a top royal source said: They are very relieved its all ending. The Prince believes that the pressure on them was becoming increasingly silly.  They hope now they can be allowed to get on and lead ordinary lives. Yesterday an array of stepladders outside the five-star Ritz in Arlington Street off Piccadilly was evidence of the host of camera crews waiting to capture the couples coming-out - scheduled for .pm. Charles, , is said to be well aware of the fortune a single snapper could make from an exclusive picture of him with -year-old Camilla. So, rather than let anyone profit at his emotional expense, he was prepared for an open house appearance. The source said: The prince has been mystied by the scale of interest in a first picture. But he does not want someone to make millions out of him. Visibly irritated by press demands during public s, the prince apparently insisted that he would not touch Camilla for last nights historic photograph. During the planning, he is said to have joked I am not going to hold her hand or give her a kiss. His attitude will certainly hit a raw nerve with supporters of Mrs Parker Bowles. Despite public vilication after the death of Princess Diana, she has remained loyal to Charles. The prince had been working on plans for their first public appearance for weeks. The Ritz party to celebrate the th birthday of Camillas sister Mrs Annabel Elliot provided the perfect opportunity.  Unlike an official engagement, where such a photograph could be seen as interfering with his public duties and giving Camilla a royal , the event is strictly a family affair. Friends revealed yesterday that the delicately-planned operation was pnt in jeopardy when Camilla developed a bad cold. Although she was still feeling unwell, the mother-of-two insisted on keeping the appointment. After the party the prince and Camilla were to step out of the main entrance of the -room Ritz into Arlington Street. Camilla was arriving early for the lavish gathering in the hotels largest banqueting room, called the Marie Antoinette Suite after the queen consort of King Louis XVI. Executive chef Giles Thompson was preparing the feast for  guests, family and friends of the Elliot and Parker Bowles families. Charles, who has been staying at Balmoral since January , was not expected to turn up until after pm. He was committed to hosting a dinner at nearby St Jarness Palace earlier in the evening. Photographers got a trial run when Charles and Camilla lookalikes drew up at the Ritz in a black chauffeur-driven Daimler. As newsmen rushed forward, the pranksters dressed in evening wear walked up the six front-entrance steps and waited for the flash-guns.   A Ritz official asked them to move on and they hurried away by car after a stunt believed to have been organised by a TV company. Timing was a major factor in the princes plans for last night. Public hostility towards Camilla after the death of Diana on August ,  has eased and recent opinion polls show that most people have accepted the relationship. There is another reason why it is so important for them to accelerate the campaign to have Camilla accepted as his official companion. can afford to es and Camilla steal the limelight from bride and groom. And to achieve that, the prince and Mrs Parker Bowles will have to be seen many times together. In the  months since Diana died, the coming-out of Camilla - orced from ex-army officer Andrew Parker Bowles in  - has been a gradual and often painful process. The first poll taken after Charles own orce was finalised in September  showed more than  per cent actively disliked Camilla. Worse was to come.   Shortly after Dianas death, Charles was dismissed as unlikely ever to be crowned. And  per cent of the public believed thathe married Camilla, he should give up the throne. They took the plunge together in July  with dinner at a private members club in London. They arrived separately, but left together at .pm without being spotted. Three months later, they were pictured - albeit apart - at the society wedding of Santa Palmer Tomkinson and writer Simon Sebag Montefiore in St Johns Wood. During the summer, Camilla had met Prince Harry with his father and last November she hosted a th birthday party for Charles at Highgrove, Gloucs.

The woman, who has not been named and instead referred to as Mrs C, was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow for treatment.The super-hospital, which is one of the largest in Europe, is already under scrutiny following a recent scandal. Two patients, including a -year-old boy, died due to an infection linked to pigeon droppings. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has admitted there were clear failings in the expectant mothers care, after a damning report was published. The woman was admitted to hospital with severe abdominal pain and suspected appendicitis. An ultrasound was carried out and she was treated for gastroenteritis, commonly referred to as stomach flu.  However, her condition deteriorated and she developed sepsis - and doctors discovered that her unborn baby had died.An inquiry found there was a catalogue of failures in the womans care including no review by an experienced obstetrician and a lack of physical examination by experienced doctors.Checks on her vital signs including blood pressure , respiratory and heart rate were not done appropriately and there was a failure to interpret the signs of sepsis. The reason for her deteriorating condition was discovered when she was opened up in the operating theatre and her appendix was removed. However she later developed sepsis and organ failure. The patient recovered after treatment but was readmitted twice more with infections in her abdominal muscles. The Scottish Public Services Ombudsmanupheld a complaint that there was an unreasonable failure to diagnose appendicitis and sepsis.   Doctors were said to have failed to adequately consider an alternative diagnosis to gastroenteritis and consideration should have been given to carrying out a CT scan or laparoscopy. The board was also criticised for delays in launching an investigation into the incident. A spokesman for the SPSO said: There was an unreasonable failure to diagnose Mrs C with both appendicitis and sepsis and, therefore, upheld Mrs Cs complaints.  A number of failings had been identied by the board, but we made some additional recommendations for learning and improvement. The hospital has been told to apologise to the patient and review the care of deteriorating patients, particularly those exhibiting signs of sepsis, with patients escalated to a senior doctor. A spokesman for NHSGCC said: We recognise there were clear failings in the patients care and will write to the patient to apologise. The Ombudsmans recommendations are being discussed by a multi-disciplinary team to identy how these can be quickly implemented and ensure that lessons learned in this case are shared with appropriate staff.

In the letter, dated the day after the Sunday Mirror revealed the Duke had not made contact, he wished Emma a speedy recovery. The message is typed but Philip has written her name and signed Yours sincerely, Philip at the bottom in blue pen. Emma, , said: When I opened it I saw the Sandringham House headed paper and went Oh my God!   Emma, has instructed solicitors to pursue a compensation claim, was left in crippling pain after the crash and has been signed off work for two months. The Kia was driven by her friend Ellie Townsend, , and Ellie’s nine-month-old son was also in the car. Prince Philip wrote her a letter saying: “I would like you to know how very sorry I am for my part in the accident at the Babingley cross-roads. “I have been across that crossing any number of times and I know very well the amount of traffic that uses that main road. It was a bright sunny day and at about three in the afternoon, the sun was low over the Wash. “In other words, the sun was shining low over the main road. In normal conditions I would have no dficulty in seeing traffic coming from the Dersingham direction, but I can only imagine that I failed to see the car coming, and I am very contrite about the consequences.  “I was somewhat shaken after the accident, but I was greatly relieved that none of you were seriously injured. “As a crowd was beginning to gather, I was advised toto Sandringham House by a local Police Officer. I have since learned that you suffered a broken arm. I am deeply sorry about this injury. “I wish you a speedy recovery from a very distressing experience.” "},{"url":null,"title":"strange rules prince george princess","story":"NewsStrange rules Prince George and Princess Charlotte must follow under no nonsense nannyPrinces George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are looked after by Norland Nanny Maria Borrallo, who has been with the Cambridge family since ShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video prince-george-turns-five-memorable-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrinces George , Princess Charlotte and little Louis have one of the best nannies money can buy.

Maria is believed to be very strict with the royal children and like all Norland Nannies has a no nonsense approach. There are a number of rules nannies at the Bath college are taught to impose on the children in their care, so its likely that George, Charlotte and Louis have to follow them.   Norland expert Louise Heren told the Sun : There will be no messing. Thats because Maria will be aware that as they step off planes, holding mums hands, smiling and waving to the crowds, there cant be any crying or terrible twos or tantrums. Theres a strict pm bedtime every night, which has to be stuck to. In a bid to discourage fussy eating, new foods and flavours are introduced every few days.   All play must take place outside, regardless of the weather. Louise said: Lots of bike rides, playing with their dogs, potentially some gardening. Norland are very into teaching children through play. If it is tipping down, they will still go out. Wet weather is just inappropriate clothing, you have to put the right stuff on.   Children are taught using games and traditional fun, such a jigsaw puzzles. Screen time is completely up to the parents, and its something Prince William has admitted they find dficult in the past.

It is not known what prompted the pair to hurl timber at each other between the terraced houses, but a video of the battle suggests these two might have forgotten the old adage love thy neighbour.The Twitter user who posted the footage online tweeted that the row broke out early one morning, although it remains a mystery where, when and, indeed, why it ever began. No need for an alarm clock at my Nanna’s house this morning when you have plank wars going off at am, wrote user @StokoeTaran, whose video had been shared more than , times on Twitter by Sunday evening. At one point, a woman attempts to intervene in the fight, lodging herself between the two men as they lob s of wood at one another as someone watches from an upstairs window.But her peace entreaty appears short-lived as she briefly disappears inside then re-emerges with her own plank of wood, which she then hurls at the neighbour.  She then doubles-down, showing javelin-competitor level accuracy as she lobs a broom stick-end first over the fence too. After his opponents disappear inside, the neighbour calmly drops the timber on his turf back over the fence.  There might not have been a lot of neighbourly sentiment on show between the trio, but many on Twitter loved the display. Twitter user @twatterleeds provided a helpful translation of British neighbourhood customs for their American cousins, as he wrote: For any American viewers - dont be alarmed this is just a tradition in England.Morning plank toss allows neighbors to show love and affection by tossing planks of fire wood to one another to keep homes warm in winter.

If a new bill is passed, this would make residents in Washington State, able to dispose of human remains by reducing them to soil through what has been called recomposition.So far there has been no opposition to the proposal and Washington residents are very excited about the prospect of becoming a tree or having a dferent alternative.” Recomposition involves putting bodies in a vessel and turning it into a nutrient-dense soil that can then be ed to families.   The aim is said to be a cheaper way of dealing with human remains and is better for the environment than burial. Burials can often spread chemicals into the ground, while cremation releases earth-warming carbon dioxide. Democrat State Senator Jamie Pedersen is sponsoring the bill in Washington’s Legislature to expand the options for disposing of human remains. He said: “People from all over the state who wrote to me are very excited about the prospect of becoming a tree or having a dferent alternative for themselves.”  The recomposition bill would also make Washington the th state to allow alkaline hydrolysis. This is the dissolving of bodies in a pressurised vessel with water and lye until just liquid and bone remains. Sen. Pedersen plans to introduce the bill next month when the new legislative session begins.

That’s cultural, it’s not on the map, and it should be.“There are loads of dferent things that could be on the map and I hope it gets people thinking about their own ideas of what should be there.“It’s a real strength that our city is considered an equal alongside cities like Bilbao, Helsinki and Barcelona.“We can’t create jobs and investment unless we extend outwith Scotland – culture is a really good way of doing that.“The map is another string to our bow.”Aside from the commode additions in Broughty Ferry, the City of Discovery’s scores of cultural highlights are all present and correct.Key buildings such as the DCA, The McManus, Dundee Rep and the VA all make the cut in the city centre – as do dozens of city churches, statues and sculptures.Assurances have been given Dundee will still feature on the map post-Brexit. vw, px\"  Dundee isn’t alone in having public loos accidentally highlighted as “cultural gems”.Glasgow has one, in the northern suburb of Stepps, while UK capital London boasts of no fewer than  “culturally signicant” toilets on the Cultural Gems map.Paris has four, while Barcelona has one. In Scandanavia, Danish capital Copenhagen has listings for five.However, Portguese capital Lisbon takes the cultural loo crown with  listed public facilities on the guide.The reasons for toilets being picked up alongside sculptures, art galleries and theatres, isn’t all that clear.Upon the project website’s launch last year, European Commission bosses said the data was based on locations listed in OpenStreetMap as “points of interest”.As a result, it appears any item listed as a “point of interest” made it into the guide without being checked.The European Commission said: “The map is crowd-sourced.“Therefore citizens, local administrators and not-for-profit-organisations are key to uploading content about their cities.“Nevertheless, the programme comes with maps providing an initial set of points of interest for European cities in the app from OpenStreetMap.”Toilets aside, the guide is a highly detailed way of finding out about a city’s achievements and its contributions to art.The comprehensive database already offers up thousands of cinemas, art galleries, sites of historical signicance and music venues.Alongside the big hitters, it lists churches and community halls – where real local culture can be found every day."},{"url":null,"title":"landmark dundee shop set to be moved for 130 home development","story":"A landmark city shop will be moved as part of proposals for a new housing estate.The demolition of The Kiosk in its current form is due to be carried out once the houses of Ellengowan estate are taken down.Planning permission is being sought to demolish the empty homes, which were built as temporary accommodation between the wars.The new development would see  homes – a mix of houses and flats – built in their place.The small convenience store on the corner of Arbroath Road and Dalkeith Road has been a community staple for almost  years.While work is taking place the shop will be temporarily moved to a blue portable building down the street.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

In summary, Mr Anstee explained, not a lot had changed since an earlier report, though a lot of remedial work would be needed.Mr Anstee added that the question is: #What use to people want to make of the hall  Do we need it at all #The next question is whether the hall should be demolished and a new facility built or whether the facade should be retained # for which heritage grant funding may be available. A sense of frustration was evident in the hall as people heard about surveys and consultation # a familiar theme for Inspire Inveraray since its formation three years ago.Hotelier Donald Clark clearly wants to see action and is not keen on retaining the old building. He said: #It#s an eyesore. I think we need to work on the premise of demolition then decide on the use of it.#Next it was on to the vexed question of Inveraray Pier. Numerous attempts to start a dialogue with the owner Archie MacArthur had failed, said Mr Anstee.One approach Inspire Inveraray is looking at is to attempt to purchase the pier using community Right to Buy legislation. There is also the question of whether to bid for the puffer, which Mr MacArthur is trying to sell, as well as the pier itself.To get to the bottom of the community#s views, consultant Charlotte Lee has been employed to pull together opinions and draw up a community action plan.Of only slightly lesser importance is the telephone box in Church Square, in which Inspire Inveraray has expressed an interest. If BT agrees to hand it over, the next question is what to do with it.The many questions highlighted during the evening in connection with the community centre, pier and even the phonebox will be condensed into a straightforward questionnaire to be handed round Inveraray homes with the help of Inveraray Community Council.Anyone wishing to contribute their views or help with the consultation can contact Charlotte Lee on info@cslconsultancy.net or call  ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 30","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt does not matter how lovely, docile and well mannered your dog is.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"caravan caught alight sparks major","story":"NewsCaravan which caught alight sparks major fire operationThe derelict property on Kilmarnock Road in Monkton went up in flames last Thursday night as the caravan attached to it caught fire.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  JAN NewsThe fire spread to the adjacent property \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA caravan which caught alight sparked a large scale fire operation as it set ablaze to a neighbouring house.

And the shining star of the region’s education system confesses she is now “living in a bubble waiting for it to burst”. Gaenor, who joins Heathfield after heading up Dalmilling Primary for five years, said: “I was very happy there and only Heathfield would have pulled me away. “It is always the school I have aspired to. My twins came here and I feel that level of affinity. “All I see is potential. I’ve never been at a school where the surroundings in the community are so rich.” Gaenor cut her teaching teeth in south London before ing north after her sister suffered a severe stroke, aged just . She said: “It made me review my le and decide what was important so we relocated back up to Scotland. “I’ve been back here for  years now and always had one eye on Heathfield as I knew it was such an exciting job. “Part of that excitement is that I live in the catchment and my children went here so it feels like coming home. “But I’m also excited about making this the flagship school. “However, we also need to make this the hub of the local community.” Fitness fanatic Gaenor admits an “open and frank exchange of views” took place during the first meeting with her new parent council last week. It follows concerns over the previous management’s approach to alleged bullying within the school. But she insisted: “I’m all for honest, vibrant and lively dialogue. “None of it was a surprise to me as a parent myself. “I would hate to think I’ll be a comparison to previous management in the school. “What I can bring is my own unique experience to the role. “I want to be open and visible and have parents approach me. “This has to be us together on the journey.” And she added: “I don’t have to grow a passion for the school. It is there within me already. “I feel like I’m in a bubble of looking forward to coming to work and being so motivated – and I’m still waiting for it to be burst.” Now Gaenor, who is often seen walking to school, is planning to get her pupils into shape as part of a new physical and mental drive.

I had a lot of balls left because Georgie loved them and my other dog doesnt so I put them in the box at the Gattonside end of chain bridge.\"Since then someone has attached it to the gate and people have been borrowing the balls and putting them back and even adding new ones.\"I just want the box to remind owners to enjoy every moment with their dog.\"Georgie passed away in May last year after contracting Alabama rot, also known as Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy .Only appearing to affect dogs, the disease damages the lining of blood vessels in the skin and kidney, resulting in ulceration of the skin and kidney damage.The condition can affect any breed or age of dog and a proportion can go on to develop severe, acute kidney failure, which is often fatal.Lynsay and her dogs Georgie and Taffy used to walk along the river most days and it was after one of these walks that she noticed Georgie had lesions on her legs.\"It was after a walk in Gattonside one Saturday that I saw that she had sores on her legs so I took her to the vet on Monday and she was given some cream.\"But she went downhill fast and by Wednesday her poo was black, which I later learnt was a sign that her kidneys were failing.\"I took her to the vets again where she was given a cone to stop her licking the sores but by Friday the vets suspected it was Alabama rot and put her on a drip and kept her in overnight hoping that she would improve.\"But on Saturday we were told that her kidneys had stopped working and she wasnt going to get better.\"I took Taffy with me to spend some time with her and then she got put to sleep.\"Alabama rot was first recorded in the UK in  and the number of cases has risen each year. Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-expansion-at-dunbars-asda-store","story":"Asda Stores Limited wants to increase the size of its Spott Road store, with more retail space and the introduction of a grocery home shopping service.The supermarket giants opened their first store in the county in Dunbar  years ago, before Tranent also welcomed an Asda store in .If given the go-ahead, the Dunbar supermarket would expand to the north, towards the neighbouring garden centre.Currently the store has a floorspace of about ,m, with the ldquomodest extension adding m to the building, with a four-berth area for home shopping.Proposals were submitted late last year to East Lothian Council and part of the planning application states: ldquoThe ultimate aim of the development is to stock a broader range of goods, increasing the storersquos appeal to established customers.The extension would result in the loss of  parking spaces, leaving  at the store.Deen Rasul, general store manager at Asda Dunbar, said: ldquoThese plans represent a signicant investment into our Dunbar store and will improve the range of goods on offer and help bring Asdarsquos famously low prices to more people, as well as providing new job opportunities.ldquoWe look forward to working with council officials, elected representatives and all other stakeholders as the plans progress.The proposals show that four vans are expected to operate from the store, with one van making four delivery trips per day and the remaining three vans doing half that.The report with East Lothian Council notes: ldquoThis small increase in trips is likely to be offset by an associated reduction in customer vehicle trips and associated parking demands, with each delivery potentially replacing numerous customer trips to the store.When the supermarket was given the go-ahead by East Lothian Council in , many traders predicted it would have a serious impact on town centre businesses.Dunbar Tradesrsquo Associationplans to look at the new proposals before making any comment, with the group meeting this month.The townrsquos community council has been invited to meet with Asda representatives before their next meeting, which takes place next Monday .Pippa Swan, the grouprsquos chairwoman, said: ldquoI was not around when Asda first came here but I am completely aware of the sensitivities or worries that it would adversely impact business on High Street.ldquoEqually, they are a relatively large local employer and provide a service.ldquoWe are going open-minded and very much welcome the opportunity to have a look at the plans."},{"url":null,"title":"public-thanked-for-huge-support-for-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"Customers at the countyrsquos Tesco stores did their bit to help the East Lothian Foodbank during a three-day collection late last year.Once again, it proved a great success, with the Tranent-based charity collecting , kilogrammes of non-perishable food over the three days, compared to , kilogramme in .The foodbank was helped at the three stores by the newly-acclaimed volunteer team of the year award winners, volunteers of East Lothian Foodbank and by ious Rotary clubs in the county, from Dunbar, Haddington, Tranent and Musselburgh, as well as Inner Wheel and Police Scotlandrsquos youth volunteers.Peter Dicker, East Lothian Foodbank manager, said: ldquoOnce again we have been astounded by the generosity of people in East Lothian with the total collected at the Tesco stores.ldquoAs well as people giving us the food, we must make a special mention of the people who voluntarily give their time to help us with the collection.ldquoAn extra special mention must go to Iain Hastie and his team at Wood Pellets East Lothian for driving round the three stores and collecting all the donations and delivering them to the foodbank in Tranent.ldquoWe would also like to thank Martin Whitfield MP and Iain Gray MSP for their continued support at Musselburgh and Haddington helping with the collections.ldquoWe must also thank the people and organisations who continue to deliver donations to us so generously.Meanwhile, the charity has also benefited from generous visitors to enjoyleisurersquos sports facilities across the county.enjoyleisure ran a lsquoRemember, Remember the Foodbank this Novemberrsquo campaign.In total, the donations collected across enjoyleisurersquos six sports centres amounted to kg, which equates to about  meals.Bill Axon, enjoyleisure general manager, said: ldquoAs a community organisation, we wanted to show our support to this invaluable local initiative and assist those who are in need of its services.ldquoWe are incredibly grateful to our customers and staff who contributed donations.

key to reducing homelessness, the local authority maintains, and it says , new affordable homes have been delivered in East Lothian since , of which  are new council homes for social rent.A further , new affordable homes are to be delivered over the next five years through the Draft Strategic Housing Investment Plan, supported by new housing land supply set out in the newly adopted East Lothian

This includes working from home and flexible working practices to ensure that nobody should lose pay or holidays.ldquoThe move by East Lothian appears to be nothing other than an exercise in saving money and will not go unchallenged.At Tuesdayrsquos meeting in Haddington, the councilrsquos chief executive Angela Leitch told councillors thatstaff could not fulfil their contract, the council ldquocould not pay them.Anger over the way the council handled last yearrsquos severe snow storms led councillors to overturn a long-standing policy on absences and agree to pay workers who had been unable to get into work.Many workers were stunned to be told that, while police were warning people to stay at home, the council was continuing with its established policy advising them they would have to take time in lieu or unpaid leave to cover the time they were unable to work.While other local authorities, including City of Edinburgh Council, took to social media to assure staff they would be paidthey were unable to work during the Wednesday and Thursday of the red weather warnings last March, East Lothian Council repeated its advice that workers should report to workit was ldquosafe to do so, or attend the nearest council office or suitable premises, or work from home or other suitable locations.Following a review, wages were reinstated for those who missed work during red weather warnings and the policy was reviewed.Councillor Willie Innes , council leader, said he expected that, should another Beast from the East hit the county, councillors would once again step in to ensure wages were not docked.He said: ldquoIt is impossible to have a policy that pleases everyone. Last year, members took the decision to pay staff ndash I would hopeit happened again we would consider making similar commitments.South of Scotland list MSP Michelle Ballantynecondemned the policy, saying: ldquoIt is completely unacceptable for East Lothian Council to tell their employees to save their holiday time in case of bad weather.

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

It was invaded, but never conquered.Itrsquos why as they say, all our wars were happy wars and all our songs were sad.But of course, as all the widows and orphans would say, that isnrsquot true, either.All these thoughts and more have been churning in my mind as I sit in my French field and watch countries Irsquove lived in, and in two cases, loved, be affected yet again by English might and arrogance.The Irish, now willingly part of, and prosperous, in a united Europe can, at long last, look calmly on the fist-shaking little Englanders in the Palace of Westminster as their bluffs are called out.Not so the Scots. Each session their representatives are laughed at, talked over, dismissed as irritants in Englandrsquos, yes Englandrsquos, desires. Humiliated even.The message is undeniable. The lsquoprecious unionrsquo counts only when votes are needed.The other lsquopreciousrsquo peace process of Northern Ireland is ready to be sacriced on the altar of English English, sovereignty.Now, imagine againthose reluctant exiles had been able to double-click the Parliament channel and hear and see all that is being said.Imagine their incredulity and joy that freedom can be simply attained by voting it to be so. Oh my ndash imagine.And that freedom can mean being an equal part of another community ndash a full European community of countries whose people have also known the despair of exile, hatred and war.Countries whose sufferings mean they stand shoulder to shoulder against those who would try to break them.They may not be perfect may still have much to learn ndash but they are as one and willing to group together, tell old tales, lsquosingrsquo old songs and above all, look out for each other.We Celts are remarkable. We are proud in a good way resilient in the best way we can be led but never driven we accept government by choice but not force or lies we will never ndash however long it takes ndash be broken.I know you may call me a dreamer but Irsquom not the only one.Imagine.Fidelma Cook: Families will be torn apart by Brexiters hatred of Freedom of Movement"},{"url":null,"title":"dippy-the-dinosaur-the-fascinating-tale-behind-the-diplodocus-at-kelvingrove","story":"From the balcony above, the scene resembles a giant jigsaw puzzle as a team of specialists knuckle down to the task at hand.

Its the only Scottish stop on a UK-wide tour.Diplodocus carnegii is named after Andrew Carnegie, the Dunfermline-born steel magnate and philanthropist who financed the excavation of the dinosaurs fossilised bones in Wyoming in . It became a centrepiece for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.In the early s, Carnegie created  casts from the original and bequeathed them to museums worldwide, including ones in Paris, Vienna, Berlin, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Munich and London, where it took its home at the Natural History Museum.King Edward VII happened to see a sketch of the dinosaur while visiting Carnegie at Skibo Castle near Dornoch, Sutherland, which led to the London commission.

According to the Natural History Museum, the dinosaur would have walked on fingers and toes. Dippys rear legs are even larger: each thigh bone is one-and-a-half-metreslong.Mirroring the neck, Dippys tail curves another seven metresbackwards. Scientists believe it might have been used to make a noise like a whip as a defence against predators.Interestingly, Dippys tail has a series of coat hanger-shaped bones hanging at regular intervals, designed to support and protect the blood vessels. Their distinct shape is what gives the species ndash diplodocus ndash its name, meaning \"double-beamed\".The colour of a fossil typically depends on what minerals replace the bone over time. The original excavated skeleton looks dark brown, so Dippy was painted in a similar shade.Dr Neil Clark, curator of palaeontology at the Hunterian in Glasgow University, is delighted to see Dippy arrive in Scotland.\"Andrew Carnegie was originally from Scotland and this is a dinosaur that was named after a Scotsman,\" he says. \"Carnegie had the cast made for the British people so it is nice that it is finally going on tour and that everyone will have the opportunity to see it.\"It may be a replica rather than real bones, yet this matters not a jot, insists Clark. \"Being a cast doesnt mean that it is a fake,\" he says. \"It is quite a precise copy of the bones and people will see the actual size of the skeleton.\"Clark, who is also president of the Geological Society of Glasgow, is looking forward to seeing it capture the publics imagination and shine a spotlight on Scotlands rich fossil heritage.\"Everybody loves a good dinosaur story and I hope that we can let people know a lot more about our Scottish links with dinosaurs,\" he says.Fossils from the Middle Jurassic period, roughly  million to  million years ago, are extremely rare and Skye is one of the few places in the world where they can be found.Over the past three decades Clark has been a regular visitor to Skye, which has earned a reputation as Scotlands dinosaur isle. He is a member of the PalAlba collaboration made up of palaeontologists, geoscientists and other related experts in this field.\"Dinosaurs in Scotland are very important worldwide,\" he says. \"A lot of people may not realise how important they are. The dinosaurs in Scotland are from a time period from which very few dinosaurs are known. They are also at a time when dinosaurs ersy greatly.\"It is a very important time period: the Middle Jurassic. Even in North America there are no dinosaur bones known from that time period.\"Scotlands first dinosaur remains ndash a single footprint ndash were discovered on the Trotternish peninsula by Dr Julian Andrews and Professor John Hudson in . The cmprint is believed to have been made by an iguanodon-like ornithopod.A decade passed before the next discovery. Then they came thick and fast. In , German collector Matthias Metz discovered a small fossilised partial tibia of a bipedal theropod near Elgol in the south of Skye.Around the same time, Lachlan Scott-Moncrieff found a fragment of bone near his home in Staffin that turned out to be from a sauropod ndash four-legged, herbivorous dinosaurs.BP geologists Dr Doug Boyd and Dr John Dixon came across a more substantial sauropod bone on the foreshore at Valtos near Staffin in .There have been bones broken too ndash certainly for Clark, who fractured his leg soon after discovering Skyes second ever set of footprints in .He had gathered a team to remove the prints from a limestone block at Port Earlish when disaster struck. Vibrations from a pneumatic drill shattered Clarks tibia and fibula in multiple places requiring him to be airlted from the beach by helicopter and rushed for emergency surgery.Yet, it didnt put him off. A few months later Clark ed to Skye ndash on crutches ndash to lead a group of geologists and there, he found a tailbone of a theropod dinosaur. \"I have mixed feelings about that year,\" he laughs.In , Clark alongside Dugald Ross, who owns the Staffin Dinosaur Museum, and hotelier Paul Booth, discovered a trackway of  to  footprints at An Corran beach. The three-toed impressions are thought to have been made by a family of megalosaurus  million years ago.Another of Clarks most prized Skye specimens has pride of place in the Hunterian: the worlds smallest dinosaur footprint. Believed to belong to a theropod, the .cmprint is similar in size to that of a blackbird. He also found the first theropod tooth on Skye at Valtos in .More recently, Clark uncovered the first evidence that dinosaurs walked on the Scottish mainland. That discovery happened last March while he was retracing the steps of his great, great grandfather, who had been part of the Scottish Gold Rush in .Next month he will be hosting a \"Rock Doctors\" fossil-themed workshop as part of a programme of events and activities being run by Glasgow Museums to mark Dippys stay at Kelvingrove.There will be another important visitor too: a Tyrannosaurus Rex will go on show at Kelvin Hall in Glasgow this April. The -million-year-old skeleton ndash known as Trix ndash is on loan from the Naturalis Bioersity Centre in Leiden, Netherlands.Dating back to the Cretaceous period, the dinosaur was excavated in Montana in . Trix ndash named after the former Dutch queen Beatrix ndash is one of only three complete T. rex skeletons known to exist anywhere in the world.The exhibition is being co-organised by the Hunterian and Glasgow Museums. \"It will be the first time I have seen a complete mounted skeleton of a T. rex. I have seen bits and pieces of T. rex before, but I havent seen a complete reconstructed one,\" says Clark.\"The other interesting thing is that the little vertebrae I found back in  may be from a primitive tyrannosaur. It may be that Scotland is the birthplace of the tyrannosaur.\"Dippy On Tour: A Natural History Adventure is at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow until May .T. rex in Town opens at Kelvin Hall on April  and runs until July .

It does not stand or fall on the popularity of inidual politicians or the policies of a single political party. This is not about a cult of personality, which is an empty rebuke devoid of any intellectual merit that some opponents have used to denigrate the Yes movement. It also insults ordinary supporters of independence and their families.Already, after the y and serious charges being faced by Alex Salmond were published, some people are seeking to make political capital. Mr Salmond has strenuously denied all of the charges and his innocence or guilt will be established in a court of law. This, though, wonrsquot stop ill-advised and ignorant speculation about the implications for the independence movement.The wider movement for independence will eventually succeed or fail by how many people like me, who hail from traditional Labour-supporting communities, it can persuade to join it. The polls that emerged at the start of the referendum campaign in  all indicated that support for independence was running at around %. This showed that there would probably never be enough lsquospiritualrsquo SNP supporters to deliver independence now or in the foreseeable future. That the Yes vote increased by around % in less than two years stemmed from several factors. For me, as I suspect it was for many from a similar background, the migration to self-determination was as much about the creeping values of neo-liberalism and profit-at-any-cost that had begun to dominate political Conservatism as it was about any emotional attachment to an independent Scotland.You might reasonably counter with the claim that neo-liberalism and profiteering have always found a welcome in the fortresses of UK political Conservatism. In the last decade or so, however, it became possible to witness a kind of genetic transmutation of traditional Conservatism into something more malevolent and toxic.Following the  banking crisis many on the left observed the ways in which the UK political elite tried to mitigate its effects. This rested on a desire to protect big capital with tax breaks and lax scrutiny and to penalise the far greater many who had endured the worst of its effects. To ensure that such a strategy flew without close inspection by those it was designed to hurt some culprits had to be provided. Thus lsquoexcessiversquo immigration and the lsquounaccountablersquo bureaucrats of the EU were identied before being tried and found guilty in the pages of the English right-wing press, which now passes for the highest court of jurisdiction in this new hard-right ideology. For the first time many Labour supporters began to look more favourably upon the idea of an independent Scotland as offering a long-term escape route from a society that seemed to have lost all sense of a moral bearing. After independence we could shake the SNPrsquos hand send them on their way with a nice clock to recognise their long service and then set about the task of ushering in an authentic socialist republic.In the five years that have elapsed since I opted for an independent Scotland Irsquove not been its most reliable role model. I was not emotionally scarred by the outcome of the referendum. Faith, family, friendship and even old football allegiances all remained higher in my list of priorities than the struggle for an independent Scotland. Independence was a preference rather a moral imperative. I still consider myself to be an Old Labour type and do not foresee any circumstances under which I would vote for the SNP, a party which still harbours too many right-wing types and Mickey Mouse liberals for my taste. The circumstances of Brexit and the conduct of those tasked with delivering it, however, have intensied my emotional commitment to an independent Scotland.The fact that Scotland is increasingly likely to be dragged out of the EU in less than nine weeks with no viable deal, and against the overwhelmingly settled will of its citizens, initially raised obvious questions about the value of Scotlands democratic institutions. This has been accompanied throughout the last two years with a disdain bordering on outright contempt for our parliament and for those elected representatives who, like me, believe that a measure of sovereignty resides in it.Worse than this, though, as testied by events of the last few weeks, is the outright dishonesty of some of the chief Brexiters who are revealed to have been on the take from institutions with a direct interest in leaving the EU. The dangerous lies about immigration found fertile ground in empty minds and, recognising such, the UK Government is making plans for military intervention on the streets of mainland Britain. The Prime Minister is sacricing the entire economic future of this country and risking serious civil unrest to placate the whims of  Ulster medievalists. These are people who awake each day hoping that they will be caught up in the Rapture that will portend the second coming of Jesus.We are dealing with a country that has succumbed to the law of the economic jungle and where the chief architects of this are now openly mocking the rest of us as they move their fortunes offshore. If violence erupts on Englandrsquos streets we can be certain of one thing: they will be on the first Learjets out of here. In Scotland we will have one last opportunity to establish something better and more human. Itrsquos now not merely a matter of moral necessity but one of self-respect. And when self-respect goes you will permit anything to be done in your name."},{"url":null,"title":"paul-hutcheon-analysis-why-claims-of-an-indyref2-mandate-are-political-hot-air","story":"Nicola Sturgeonrsquos ideal backdrop for her imminent announcement on the timetable for indyref is not dficult to imagine. Growing support in the polls. A bit of political momentum. And nothing disastrous lurking around the corner.A potential trial involving her predecessor and mentor, who has been charged with multiple counts of attempted rape and indecent assault, hardly meets the criteria and will inevitably provide the SNP leadership with sleepless nights.But the impact of the Salmond case on Scotlandrsquos constitutional future should not be over-stated. The former SNP leader is a political has-been who took an axe to his own reputation when he agreed to work for a Putin propaganda station. His supporters are not swing voters they will back Yes regardless of the facts.Sturgeon faces referendum roadblocks far more formidable than the Salmond case, particularly over her delay in revamping the case for independence and, critically, explaining the process by which she intends to deliver another plebiscite.The First Ministerrsquos line has been to claim she has a ldquocast iron mandate for a referendum. A combination of her partyrsquos victory at the last Holyrood election, Parliament endorsing a second vote, as well the SNP winning a majority of MPs in , turned it into a ldquotriple lock mandate.However, a \"mandate is a rhetorical device that has no basis in law. In politics, the only mandate a party can secure from voters is the right to bring forward a policy for parliamentary scrutiny. An initiative may be pushed through, rejected, or tweaked, but there is no such thing as automatic implementation based on an election victory.A mandate must also reflect the powers of the legislature. The SNP could win the next Holyrood election on the basis of demanding a poundbn funding top up from Westminster, but Theresa May would be under no obligation to hand over the money. You cannot force another Government to do something.Let us suspend reality and pretend Holyrood does have the power to organise another referendum unilaterally. In ,  SNP MSPs - a minority - were elected on the basis that the Parliament should have this ldquorightthere was a ldquomaterial change such as ldquoScotland being taken out the EU against our will.However, the pro-independence Scottish Green MSPs did not sign up to this form of words ahead of the poll. Patrick Harviersquos party instead suggested indyref should be triggered by a petition being signed by an ldquoappropriate number of voters. This has not happened. Only by ignoring the Green manesto and pretending they made the same commitment as the Nationalists can you conjure a credible majority at Holyrood.Some of the more adventurous Nationalists would like Holyrood to ignore Westminster and legislate for a Catalonia-style referendum. But anyone with a basic understanding of Sturgeonrsquos cautious political instincts understands this will not happen. She has no ambitions to become Scotlandrsquos Clara Ponsati.The importance of the Edinburgh Agreement, which Sturgeon helped draw up, was not whether such a bilateral deal was legally required. What it confirmed was that a legitimate referendum must be based on the consent of both sides. Without such a partnership you are left with a ldquowildcat referendum, legal challenges and a boycott from the No side. No sensible person in the Yes movement would favour this move.Sturgeon also faces the problem of an increasingly restless pro-independence movement. A senior Yesser told me two groups currently co-exist in the ldquoindy coalition. ldquoYou have activists whose priority, above all , is to have another independence referendum, he said. ldquoBut you have wiser heads whose priority is to win a referendum.A primary reason behind Yes losing in  was the inability of the pro-independence side to reach out to soft No voters and speak their political language. Some activists made no attempt others were simply contemptuous of their opponents.I attended Yes events during the campaign for news-gathering purposes and my notebooks are littered with examples of aggressive speeches and contributions that persuaded nobody.Here are a selection of the descriptions by speakers and audience members on the UK: ldquowar-mongering ldquoeconomically bankrupt and ldquofailed imperial state. Labour supporters were dismissed as ldquored Tories and the BBC was either ldquobiased or a ldquodisgrace.Some of the hustings were open-mic, rather than open mind, and marked by apocalyptic warnings that only appealed to people who were already furious. Nuance was a foreign country and subtlety a stranger. Many of the same folk are now demanding Sturgeon immediately delivers indyref.The First Minister knows, deep down, there is only one narrow road that can take her to a second referendum. The SNP and the Greens would need to win a majority of seats in  on an explicit promise of another vote. Such an outcome would not constitute a ldquomandate, but it would put maximum pressure on the UK Government. Legal solutions have a habit of following political victories."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-greens-wont-support-snp-budget-unless-council-funding-plan-changes","story":"Patrick Harvie, the partyrsquos co-convener, said the Nationalists seemed determined to force through a ldquohugely damaging Budget, which he said the Greens could not back.However, a Holyrood source said the Greens had not said they would vote against the tax and spending plans, which left them with the option of abstaining.With the SNP Government only commanding a minority of votes at Holyrood, Nicola Sturgeonrsquos administration requires the support of another party to pass laws, or an abstention.The Tories, Labour and the Liberal Democrats appear certain to vote against the SNPrsquos proposed Budget this week, which leaves the Greens as kingmakers.Harvie and his colleagues have laid down two demands: ldquoprogress on local tax reform and making councils less financially dependent on the Government.However, although the Greens have supported the SNP Government in the past on budgets, Harvie said yesterday his party is not in a position to support the plans at this point.He said: \"If the Government continues to refuse to accept our proposals or even come up with fair alternatives, we cannot vote for this budget when it comes to Parliament on Thursday.\"Given the huge uncertainty being caused by SNP Ministers stubbornness, Ive no doubt council workers and service users will be astonished that were in this situation at such a late stage.

Even once all these Nazi genocide survivors have died, the day will not lose its living voice. For genocide still pulses across the world.The living voice of International Holocaust Remembrance Day is there in the survivors of the many genocides that have happened in recent decades. No other recent genocide may have taken so many lives, but all have been as horrying and bewildering in their atrocity.Many of these voices are still young. Among them, for instance, visiting Scotland this weekend is -year-old Fareeda Abbas, a Yazidi woman who, like Nadia Murad, last yearrsquos winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, is a survivor from Kojo, a village massacred by Islamic State.On August , , Islamic State soldiers gathered all of the people from her village in the school building and asked them to convert to Islam ndash then, when they rejected that, they began killing the men,  over the course of one day, including her father and two of her brothers.For four months, Abbas was held in captivity, raped, beaten, forced to watch an eight-year-old girl being raped. At one point her injuries were so bad she could hardly move or see. After several attempts at escape, on the third she succeeded.Abbas is one of the key driving forces in Yazda, a charity that aims to prevent future genocides against the Yazidi community and other minorities, and to assist them in recovery. Recently it held a fundraiser in Edinburgh, organised by a Scot who had been affected by their story. It was a reminder that the Yazidi plight must not be forgotten.Thousands of Yazidi women are still imprisoned by Isis. Around , Yazidi were killed, and many more fled to refugee camps. It is a community so broken its survival depends on international support.Meanwhile, there are the voices of the Rohingya, around , of whom were killed in Myanmar in , and , are currently living across camps in Coxrsquos Bazar.There is also Sudan, where hundreds of thousands of Darfuris have been killed under Omar al-Bashirrsquos genocidal regime, and the many other countries, where according to Genocide Watch, there is a genocide emergency.But genocide doesnrsquot pop up from nowhere. We can see it coming. The Genocide Watch site lists around  countries which are already at what it describes as the ldquoextermination stage of genocide, and many more that are involved in polarisation or other processes which it outlines as leading up to mass murder.Never again, we say. But then we look around the word and see that here it is again, and again. If we want to know what wersquove learned in the  years since Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated, we need only look at how we have reacted to these recent genocides and what the international community has failed to do. These are the people we should think about most on International Holocaust Memorial Day ndash the people still in the grip of horror, or aftermath, the people who need support.Above all, though, this day should provide fuel to a fight against the hatred, polarisation and dehumanisation that, according to Genocide Watch, are preconditions for genocide. These are as present as ever across the world, perhaps on the rise.In this climate, it seems that more than ever we need to listen to the words of Nazi death march survivor Harry Spiro: ldquoI came to the conclusion a long time ago that hating people doesnrsquot achieve anything. People are capable of doing horrendous things to each other, but that isnrsquot overcome by yet more hate.Sharing in mob justiceYou only have to look at some of the responses online to the fact that former Shameless star Tina Malone is being prosecuted for contempt of court for sharing an image of someone said to be Jon Venables to realise that vigilantism is alive and well in the British public. For, it seems that plenty are out to support Malone, not just because they think the possibility of her being jailed is ridiculous and would represent a step too far ndash which is fair enough ndash but because they think she was quite right to share the Venables picture and that he should indeed be exposed.Mob justice seemed to be the mood of the day, with a general feeling pervading that Venables would deserve whatever came to him. Few were the voices saying, this is the law and the kind of restrictions we need in order to live in a civilised society where justice isnrsquot meted out by crowds baying for blood. But Malones fame makes her a particularly good example to pursue for this sharing, which was done by many others.The trial no doubt will gain much attention. Surely, after this, no one will be able to share Venablersquos identity, and say, as she did, ldquoI am not au fait with the law."},{"url":null,"title":"john-kerr-on-brexit-scotland-and-the-far-right","story":"The -year-old Glaswegian is scathing of the way Britain handled the negotiations - and this is a man who knows about negotiation. As a key member of the European Convention, Kerr wrote Article  of the Lisbon Treaty ndash the clause which triggered Brexit. He was permanent undersecretary at the Foreign Office ndash making him effectively the UKrsquos chief diplomat - and he was also our man in Washington and Brussels, serving as Ambassador to the United States and as the British representative to the European Union. He also negotiated the Maastricht Treaty with John Major, securing the UKrsquos opt out from the euro, and negotiated nuclear armaments for Margaret Thatcher at Nato.THE MISTAKES\"We didnrsquot know our foe very well,\" he says of the negotiations ndash not that Kerr sees the EU as an enemy, quite the opposite. \"We didnrsquot study the other side. We thought we could have our cake and eat it. We thought they needed us more than we needed them, that we could pick them off one by one, that the deal could be done in Berlin over a weekend.\"He speaks incredulously of Brexiteer ministers who \"didnrsquot understand that [the  EU member states] would stick together, would stick up for Ireland, would defend the integrity of the single market. These were basic mistakes\".A bigger mistake, though, was that \"we didnrsquot have a clear vision of where we wanted to end up. We didnrsquot decide how close or far away from the EU we wanted to be\". Theresa May, says Kerr, avoided that discussion in Cabinet as ministers would have disagreed ndashuntil at Chequers last July when she did put forward her proposals resulting in the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson, as Brexit Secretary and Foreign Secretary.Kerr continues with his withering assessment of May: \"She didnrsquot reach out to Parliament, shersquos never tried talking to the opposition to find a common position, shersquos never reached out to the country and explained we canrsquot have our cake and eat it, and shersquos never reached out to Edinburgh, Cardf and Belfast and tried to form a consensus of the four nations.\"It was \"muddling along\", he says. \"Getting involved in tactical battles without an overall strategy is a big mistake ndash and one that we made.\"If therersquos been worse negotiations in history, then Kerr \"canrsquot think of one at the moment\". Mayrsquos deal is \"very humiliating\" and its parliamentary defeat \"unprecedented\", he says. \"With some of my friends in Brussels, itrsquos quite awkward talking to them now as theyrsquore embarrassed by the scale of their success and our humiliation\".Kerr believes civil servants from the Foreign Office should have played a central role in negotiations. He turns his attention to Johnson, Davis and Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary. \"I donrsquot think it was a good idea to put Johnson, Fox and Davis in charge of this negotiation,\" he says. \"I think that meant the Prime Minister was slightly cut off from official advice.\"In comparison, EU officials involved in negotiations \"were professionals who knew the European institutions very well\". Kerr says the Foreign Office was cut out as it \"was not really trusted because it was seen as having been in the past rather in favour of remaining in the EU\".\"A very serious mistake was made putting Mr Johnson in charge of the Foreign Office,\" he adds, \"because the Prime Minister clearly didnrsquot trust Mr Johnson, but advice coming from the Foreign Office obviously had to come through Mr Johnson and that probably reduces the chances of that advice being listened to.\"Kerr points out that \"the unity of the  has been remarkable, and thatrsquos partly down to us making it easier for them by never coming forward with any proposals at any stage of the negotiation. We always reacted to proposals from the other side. In negotiation, the power of holding the pen is real ndashyou set the agenda by putting forward the proposals, you donrsquot necessarily get everything you put forward but yoursquore off to a good start. The inability to decide in Cabinet where we wanted to end up meant we never actually put a proposal on the table. We made speeches in London but we didnrsquot put forward any negotiating documents.\"WHAT NEXTKerr now believes that we are heading \"for extra time\" ndash which could only be done through an extension of Article  delaying Brexit ndash and then a second referendum.\"I think the muddle wersquore in now is one which canrsquot be sorted by March . I think it may well end up in a second referendum, and I think it should end up in a second referendum as itrsquos now been established that a lot of the promises made in  canrsquot be kept, and people have tumbled to the fact that leaving without a deal would be a very serious economic disruption. Therersquos also been a very clear rejection of the deal that Mrs May brought back. It follows there should either be a better deal or no Brexit. I think wersquore probably heading for a second referendum.\"Renegotiation is unlikely. \"Itrsquos possible a dferent form of Brexit will emerge from Parliament and be negotiated with the EU,\" says Kerr, \"but I donrsquot think so. I think the EU isnrsquot going to make many changes to the deal it spent two years negotiating.\"As to how a second referendum would go, Kerr says we are in the lap of the gods. \"At present, opinion polls say thattherersquos a referendum tomorrow Remainers would win - but David Cameron was ahead with his remain campaign at the start of the  referendum and he lost.\"If he was advising the Government hersquod tell them \"wersquore in a bad mess, the best thing to do is stop and think and ask the people what they want now they can see what leaving means: do they want Mrs Mayrsquos deal, no deal ndash which would be a complete disaster ndash or do they want to stick with the deal wersquove got, full membership of the EU\".If Britain chose to remain in Europe \"no-one could make us pay a price by taking off our rebate or forcing us to join the euro. These threats the leavers talk about, none of them are true. We would pay no price, political or financial,we decided to stay. So I think wersquore heading for a pause for thought, an extension of Article , and a referendum.\"SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCEKerr got involved in the independence referendum because of Europe. \"I campaigned against Alex Salmond as I didnrsquot believe him when he saidwe Scots went independent while the UK was in the EU that wersquod be allowed to just pull up another chair at the table,\" he says.Kerr argued that an independent Scotland would need to apply for EU membership. \"I thought that would be perfectly doable, but when Scotland got in it would be on new members terms,\" he said ndash that would mean no UK-style rebate. \"Scots would therefore be paying more per head that any Englishman,\" said Kerr.However, Kerr accepts that \"this argument is irrelevant\"the UK leaves the EU ndash and that means a big part of the Better Together case collapses.Nevertheless, Kerr remains a strong supporter of the union. \"Being members of the UK multiples Scottish influence. If we Scots left the UK, the economic disruption would be even greater than the economic disruptionas members of the UK we leave the EU.\" He adds: \"Economists say the effect of leaving the single market of the UK, in terms of the damage to the Scottish economy, would be five times as great as the damage to the UK of leaving the EU.\"Personally, Kerr says, he wants to be \"very Scottish, pretty British, and rather European\".NORTHERN IRELANDKerr is hoping that peace holds in Northern Ireland amid the destabilisation of Brexit. \"Wersquore in a very dangerous country when wersquove stories like the Government thinking of going for some amendment to the Good Friday Agreement as a way of getting around the need for the backstop,\" he says.\"The Good Friday Agreement is a hugely important achievement and for  years itrsquos worked and we havenrsquot had ato the Troubles. We need to tip toe around this very carefully and Irsquom not sure all the politicians in London quite understand how fragile the situation is.\"I think itrsquos also a pity that the Government is relying for its majority on the DUP. I think itrsquos quite hard to play the role that John Major and Tony Blair played of being the mediator, the honest broker,yoursquore relying for your political survival on the support of one party which is very sectarian in its support.\"THE FAR RIGHTKerr says that a second referendum would \"bring some social tensions\" with hardcore Leavers angry at another vote, but he feels \"the social tensions over time of dragging us out of the EU without giving us the chance to say what we want, now the terms are known, would be even more socially disruptive\".\"Young people,\" he says, \"would be deeply resentfulthe golden oldies refused them the chance to have another say.\"Kerr also worries about the effect of English nationalism on the rest of the country. \"Itrsquos the case that in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, that to be dragged out because of an English nationalist vote against the EU would breed resentment unless there was another fair test of what the public as a whole wants.\"\"You get social tension either way,\" he says. However, we need to face down the worst of it.\"If you look at the history of countries where right-wing populist movements gained force ndash say, the history of s Germany ndash the unwillingness to stand up to thugs, thatrsquos really very dangerous to society. The worst reason for not having a second referendum would bewe were frightened of right-wing populist gangs in the street ndash you have to take a stand against that sort of thing. We live in a liberal democratic country and people should not be blackmailed or bludgeoned into a particular political course by threats from thugs.\"WHAT THE WORLD MAKES OF IT ALLKerr knows the corridors of power the world over. Today, governments around the globe are bewildered by the UK chucking away influence and prestige.\"The world doesnrsquot quite understand whatrsquos going on,\" he says. \"It seems to be some breakdown in the UK.\" He adds: \"The fact we were one of the two most influential states in the EU meant that American presidents listened to us quite a lot as they knewthey could do a deal with us we could probably sell that deal to the EU. It was a multiplier of our influence.\"We were more powerful in Brussels as we were known to be influential in Washington, and we were more influential in Washington as were known to be powerful in Brussels. Our friends in Canberra, Delhi, and Ottawa attached considerable importance to the help we could give them in Brussels, so our friends around the world are a bit confused as to why we would want to give all that up.\"I donrsquot think the die is yet cast, though. I think we could well draw back ndash in which case this would be seen as a very odd episode, where we seem to have gone through some sort of crisis but come through it okay.\"If we go ahead and leave the EU I think wersquoll pay a price that wonrsquot just be economic ndash and itrsquoll be a serious economic price, particularly for poorer people in our society ndash it would also be political. I think our influence in the world as a whole would shrink.\"THE ROOTS OF BREXITFew,any, of the main drivers of Brexit had much to do with Europe, in Kerrrsquos opinion. First and foremost is \"the way the British political machine and successive governments tended to connive with Fleet Street in presenting Brussels as a place of endless battles and ambushes, that Britain was alone against these horrible continentals\".In fact, he says, \"we were the most influential state in Brussels. We had more influence on the commission than any other member state, the single market was ised by Margaret Thatcher ndash but ministers liked to pretend that it was a struggle between the forces of light, the British, and the forces of darkness on the continent\".Secondly, comes the toxic subject of immigration. \"Political elites underestimated the effects of immigration on particular bits of the country. Although immigration is very good for the country, it clearly puts strains on health, education and housing in particular areas, and that was ruthlessly exploited by the Leave campaign.\"Peoplersquos concern wasnrsquot with young people from Poland coming to earn some money and then go home, it was more with immigration from the subcontinent, from India and Pakistan, and there was that nasty link made between Muslim immigration and a terrorist threat ndash a  link in my view.\"EU membership doesnrsquot in any way restrain what our immigration rules are in respect of non-EU citizens, sopeople had wanted to restrict immigration from the subcontinent they could have done so at any time and the EU would have had nothing to say about it.\"Finally, therersquos the economic component. \"The huge wealth of financial Britain, particularly the City of London, contrasted with some left behind bits of the country, and that contrast was deepened by the austerity policies of George Osborne.\"Saying lsquowe are all in this togetherrsquo sounded good but it didnrsquot feel like that for people who saw tax cuts for the rich and huge cuts in support for local government, the NHS, education, and the closure of libraries. That too had nothing to do with the EU. It wasnrsquot EU rules which meant we had to go through austerity, it was the decision after the  crisis that we needed to tighten our belts, and the way we tightened our belt was seen in some parts of the country as pretty unfair.\"Itrsquos a pity then, Kerr adds wryly, that the standard bearers for the remain campaign in  ended up being David Cameron and George Osborne."},{"url":null,"title":"why-venezuela-is-the-one-to-watch","story":"THE rousing lyrics of the national anthem said it all. ldquoOff with the chains! Off with the chains!, they sang as one voice in the streets of Caracas last Wednesday. Just moments earlier, constitution in hand, Juan Guaido, standing before tens of thousands of his supporters had taken the oath declaring himself president of Venezuela.No sooner had he done so than news broke of the United Statesrsquo recognition of Guaido as the interim president and a short time later a whole raft of Latin American countries, notably allies of Washington, duly followed suit.It all might have had a feeling of spontaneity, but watching the dramatic events unfold last week in Venezuela one was left with the persistent impression that so much of what was unfolding was all very carefully orchestrated.By Friday, in a leafy square in the Caracas neighbourhood of Chacao, Guaido ndash now the de facto opposition leader to incumbent president Nicolas Maduro ndash was urging Venezuelarsquos armed forces to ldquocome over to the side of the people to bring about fresh elections and ato democracy.As every day passes the distinct whf of regime change becomes ever stronger in Venezuela, leaving this giant Latin American country at an uncertain political crossroads and one not without some considerable danger.Even the timing of last weekrsquos resurgence in the countryrsquos opposition to Maduro seemed to have been worked out to the day. It came during a highly symbolic date for Venezuelans, as they marked the st anniversary of a civilian and military uprising that overthrew former Venezuelan dictator General Marcos Perez Jimenez back in .So is history repeating itself and is Maduro, widely regarded as a dictator, about to be ousted, or will he, as some suggest, hang on with the help of the countryrsquos all-powerful military Venezuelarsquos journey to this volatile political juncture has been a rocky one to say the least. For his part, Maduro has continued the huge social welfare programmes and price control policies of previous Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, who steered the country toward socialism before dying in .But a crash in the price of crude oil in  was the catalyst for Venezuelarsquos woes, with the cost of a barrel dropping from nearly  to . This coincided with nearly a decade of mismanagement, as the countryrsquos government squandered its phenomenal oil wealth. Today, oil production has declined to barely one-third of the level a decade ago.At the same time, inflation has soared, and the International Monetary Fund predicts it will reach a staggering  million per cent this year.The crisis has left Latin America reeling from an unprecedented mass exodus of Venezuelan migrants in search of food. About . million people have fled the crisis since , according to the United Nations, while those among the  million Venezuelans left behind face failing public services including water, electricity and transport.Last week, it seemed like their patience had finally run out, and buoyed by the appearance of a new leader in the shape of telegenic congressional chief Guaido, many seemed ready to face down the Maduro regime.Such a stance, of course, has been music to the ears of those in the US administration of President Donald Trump who have been gunning for Maduro for some time. As far back as the summer of , Trump, citing George HW Bushrsquos - invasion of Panama as a positive precedent, repeatedly pushed his national security staff to launch a military assault on crisis-plagued Venezuela.According to reports in the American weekly magazine The Nation, Trump wanted to know why the United States could simply not invade  Time and again in meetings with senior staff he is said to have brought up the idea.While military and civilian advisers, are said to have forcefully dismissed the notion Trump then outsourced Venezuela policy to Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who, along with National Security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began co-ordinating with the Venezuelan opposition.Indeed, prior to being appointed Secretary of State, Pompeo, former director of the CIA in , was already on the record as admitting that he wasldquohopeful that there can be a transition in Venezuela.The CIA he said was ldquotrying to help themunderstand the things they might do so that they can get a better outcome for their part of the world and our part of the world.CIA meddling in Latin America, of course, is nothing new, making it easier for Maduro to point the finger at Washington and casting those it supports in Venezuela as nothing more than American puppets.Almost immediately after Washingtonrsquos recognition of Guaido last week Maduro broke off relations with the US, giving its diplomats until this weekend to leave and ordering Venezuelan diplomats tohome by the same deadline. Not surprisingly, Madurorsquos reliable allies in the shape of China, Cuba, Bolivia, and Turkey then rallied in their backing for the president, none more so than Russia.ForCuba was the Kremlinrsquos closest ally in Latin America during the Cold War, these days itrsquos Venezuela, whose still vast oil wealth gives Moscow direct influence over an Opec member.That Madurorsquos predecessor and mentor Chavez was stridently anti-American made Venezuela the ideal partner in the eyes of Russian president Vladimir Putin.According to an investigation by the Reuters news agency, the Kremlin is deeply invested in the survival of Madurorsquos regime, having sunk both political and financial capital into Venezuela. Russia is said to have propped up the countryrsquos rulers with at least  billion in loans and credit lines since , often taking oil assets in . For obvious reasons then Moscow is far from happy about what one Russian official government newspaper described as the US ldquocarrying out a classic coup drsquoetat in Venezuela.According to an exclusive report by Reuters, the contractors are associated with the so-called Wagner group whose members, mostly ex-service personnel, fought clandestinely in support of Russian forces in Syria and Ukraine.The story cites Yevgeny Shabayev, the head of the Khovrino Cossack organisation, who has his own background as a mercenary and routinely speaks to the international press about such activities as well as anonymous sources.ldquoOur people are there directly for his protection, Shabayev told Reuters, adding that the mercenaries were there specically to prevent rogue members of Venezuelarsquos security forces from detaining Maduro. He also claimed that Wagner had around  iniduals in the country.Citing contacts in a Russian state security organisation, Shabayev claims the Russian contingent flew to Venezuela at the start of last week, a few days before opposition protests to Maduro started.He said they set off in two chartered aircraft for Havana, Cuba, from where they transferred onto regular commercial flights to Venezuela. While verying such claims remains dficult, the report,accurate, would underline the extent to which Russia is concerned over the latest development in Venezuela and the potential of the crisis to draw in outside forces.For the moment, most observers agreethat the direction in which the crisis travels in the coming days and the fate of Maduro and his rival Guaido will very much depend on the reaction of Venezuelarsquos own military.Showing considerable astuteness, Guaido has tried to break the strong bonds that tie the army and Maduro by offering an amnesty to any personnel in the ,-strong armed forces who disavow the president.Addressing members of the military last week before renewed street protests, Guaido said: ldquoWersquore not asking you to launch a coup drsquoetat, wersquore not asking you to shoot. Wersquore asking you not to shoot at us.On Friday, at a news conference, he went even further in efforts to appease the army. ldquoI want to insist, to our military family, our brothers, the moment has arrived for you to put yourselves on the side of the constitution, Guaido appealed.Whether the army that is also supported by some . million civilian militiamen listens to Guaidorsquos offers is crucial in determining whether Maduro stays in office or the country makes a peaceful transition of power. Earlier last week, before the streets protests and Guaido declared himself interim president, there was a small uprising on a Caracas military outpost by low-ranking National Guard officers, that some thought might mark the start of a sht in the militaryrsquos position but nothing has followed since. But not all are convinced.ldquoA sergeant at a National Guard outpost is not to me important, what would be important is a situation like that in a major unit or a battalion, observed Rocio San Miguel, a military expert with non-profit group Citizen Control, speaking of the uprising. In the main, opinions of analysts on which way the armed forces will jumpat all remain mixed. Some suggest there are subtle indications they may, for the first time, be reconsidering their ironclad support for Maduro.ldquoWhat I think we are seeing is a security system and armed forces that are still trying to figure out where they are on this issue, William Brownfield, a former US ambassador to Venezuela, told the Washington Post on Friday.The point on which most analysts agree, however, is that soldiers have multiple reasons to be angry. Military installations are steadily decaying along with the rest of the country, and salaries quickly disappear amid two million per cent annual inflation.Rights organisations say that around  soldiers were arrested in  for conspiring against the government, while , more deserted the National Guard.More than aware of the potential threat that lurks within the military to his government, Maduro has played his own card to keep the army on side, putting officers in charge of key posts in the government and state oil company PDVSA while offering lucrative oilfield services contracts for military-linked firms.So far, over the past week, the armed forces have been unusually restrained in dealing with the political crisis.Not only did they refrain from launching an all-out offensive against massive anti-government demonstrations ndash although  people have been killed in recent days ndash but they have also not arrested Guaido.According to the New York Times, factions of army officers who have already defected say they are plotting s from their makesht headquarters in Peru, Colombia and other neighbouring countries. The Trump administration is also said to have held secret meetings with rebellious Venezuela military officers over the last year to discuss their plans for the overthrow of Maduro, according to American officials and a former Venezuelan military commander who participated in the talks.But not all within Venezuelarsquos militaryrsquos ranks view Washington in a favourable light, far from it. A resilient anti-American ideology remains and in some cases was no doubt inadvertently bolstered last week by Washingtonrsquos eagerness to back Guaido. ldquoThese are guys that fought with Chavez, that believe in their hearts that the US is the enemy, says Eva Golinger, a Venezuelan-American lawyer and author of Confidante Of \"Tyrants\" who is also an outspoken supporter of the late Venezuelan leader.Sixty years ago, when Venezuelans took to the streets, the then dictatorship collapsed in the face of surging protests.But demonstrations alone didnrsquot bring down Venezuelarsquos strongman back then. Only when the military stepped in, with tanks alongside protesters, did the dictatorship fall.

Having since confirmed the event indeed took place, the legendary director has also admitted he remains unsureReagan was being honest with his guests ndash or simply pulling off deadpan surrealism better than Rikki Fulton or Jacob Rees-Mogg.One thing is incontrovertibly true ndashRonald Reagan had intimate knowledge of extra-terrestrial visitations to Earth, then he certainly knew they werenrsquot friendly, doe-eyed botanists. Without even taking his bizarre satellite-laser ldquoStar Wars missile defence system into consideration, Reaganrsquos numerous mentions of aliens in speeches marked him as a blatant UFO-nut hiding in plain sight. One turning a blind eye to the Pentagon burning through tens of millions of taxpayer dollars investigating ldquoforeign advanced aerospace weapons.Yet,such research ndash carried out under dferent guises by the US military since Project Blue Book in the s ndash was simply to ascertain the threat from traditional Russian or Chinese bogeymen, then it seems they were a wee bit more technologically advanced than previously thought.This week, the Pandorarsquos Box of top secret Pentagon documents was declassied under a Freedom of Information request ndash a single five-page letter containing the titles of a bewildering litany of otherworldly research papers commissioned from scientists around the globe.The titles of these academic studies certainly donrsquot concur with commonly accepted Russian technical malevolence like vote rigging and web trolling. Certainly, research into invisibility cloaking, dark energy, stargates, multidimensional manipulation, meta-materials, laser weapons, quantum entanglement and ldquocontrolling external devices in the absence of limb-operated interfaces seems more like a Philip K Dick fever dream.If nothing , the document ndash addressed primarily to the office of late Senator and former pilot John McCain, who also had a considerable interest in colourful accounts of unusual aviation ndash certainly proves the Pentagon had been trying to get their heads around the true nature of a somewhat peculiar security threat. And unless the Russians or Chinese have torn a wormhole through the fabric of spacetime with a laser weapon recently, it wasnrsquot them.Uni lateral thinkingTHE exotic nature of some of the research papers commissioned by the US militaryrsquos Advanced Aerospace Threat Identication Programwould raise a quizzical eyebrow on even Vladmir Putinrsquos Botox-irrigated deathmask.Itrsquos certainly reaffirmed the suspicions of the global Ufology community, who only learned of the research papers existence last week after the AATIP letter ended up on the desk of Nick Pope, ex-head of the UK Governmentrsquos official UFO research project. Colloquially known as Britianrsquos ldquoFox Mulder, the affable Nick immediately teased true believers on Twitter with some ambiguous speculation, saying: ldquoIt still doesnrsquot give us a definitive answer to whether, as claimed, lsquoforeign advanced aerospace weapon threatsrsquo is coded language for UFOs.Nick would likely call the documentrsquos revelations a solid five on the Rio count ndash a new global ET ldquoRichter scalersquo developed by academics at our very own St Andrews University. It marks global reports of extraterrestrial activity from zero to  ndash the alarm sounding when Jacob Rees-Mogg rips off his skin suit to reveal true reptilian form.Thatrsquos not all academics at St Andrews have been getting up to though. One of the AATIP reportrsquos  ldquoadvanced technology studies was completed by the impressively alpha-sounding Dr Ulf Leonhardt, a respected German scientist working at the uni at the time.Cynics may think Ulfrsquos ldquoInvisibility Cloaking paper better suited to Hogwartsrsquo library than John McCainrsquos desk, but the good professor is a noted global expert on something called quantum optics, which juxtaposes the fact nothing actually exists with photon manipulation. One day, this may potentially allow a military force to enter a country without being seen. And grant perverts access to your bathroom as you shower.Follow the moneyTRUTH is a funny thing ndash will orsquo the wisp, a subjective perception in the beholderrsquos eyes. Yet, as the human brain or internet didnrsquot always exist, an untainted objective reality clearly exists ndash and the empirical truth behind any murky complex mystery involving our species often reveals itself by simply applying one time-tested method ndash following the money. By doing this, the AATIP report is revealed as perhaps less revelatory than hype suggests.From -, the Pentagon spent pound million commissioning these  papers. Meaning, towering piles of hard cash were on offer for academics willing to sell their credibility for a basement swimming pool. Might be dficult to find one who wouldnt. A few imaginative chapters of pseudo-waffle on non-existent technology that only Hollywood CGI can presently bring to le  Beats working for a living.Itrsquos also perhaps no coincidence that many of these ldquoacademics were already already part of a network of true believers ndash the now-defunct ldquoNational Institute for Discovery Science , which was well known for its studies of UFO sightings, extraterrestrials and other ldquofringe topics.To understand why such a band of eccentrics were ever commissioned by the Pentagon in the first place, we must first understand the origins of AATIP. Initiated in  by then US Senator Harry Reid to study unexplained aerial phenomena, the group was formed at the request of Reidrsquos influential friend, Nevada businessman and UFO true believer Robert Bigelow. Who, coincidentally, also founded the aforementioned NIDSci.And, again, entirely coincidentally Irsquom sure, it was Bigelow Aerospace which won the AATIP contract to manage its research.Military writer Joseph Trevithick has since carried out some admirable work uncovering the interesting backgrounds of some of the papers authors, a number of whom already had associations with Bigelow. The largest single source of these Pentagon academic reports is EarthTech International of Texas, whose CEOs both also have close ties to the billionaire business mogul.Trevithick also reveals that Marc Millis, a former NASA propulsion engineer, is also among the authors. Millis apparently left NASA after attending a venture capital event that some fella called Joe Firmage hosted in . Firmage, for those unaware, is a Silicon Valley tech millionaire who claims he had an unexplained visionary experience where a lsquobeingrsquo produced a ball of energy which then entered his body. Weve all been there.Perhaps being exposed to the mind-bending fantasies of some of these academics explains another great mystery of our times ndash why John McCain believed Sarah Palin was a sensible choice of running mate for the  Presidential elections. Likely he thought she would come in handy in a world threatened by extra-terrestrial invasion, being able to communicate directly with destructive, hostile oddities intent on destroying Earth and depleting our natural resources.And finally ...ON his death bed, John McCain enjoyed one last dig at his nemesis Donald Trump, accusing him of ldquohiding behind walls. Although McCain never became president himself, another wall-hating Republican did ndash the aforementioned Ronald Reagan.Although itrsquos unknownthe AATIP paper convinced McCain of a viable alien threat, itrsquos certain that Reagan believed in such a possibility ndash and used his fears as leverage to take down the actual Berlin Wall.During the  Geneva Summit, Reagan and Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev had a private chat. Years later, Gorbachev revealed that Reagan had simply asked him to set aside their dferences in case the world was invaded by aliens. No, really.Perhaps, in the current climate of ision, intolerance and social discord, another famous fearmongering speech by Ronnie is still relevant today: ldquoI occasionally think how quickly our dferences would vanishwe were facing an alien threat from outside this world.\"Yet, I ask you, is not an alien force already among us  What could be more alien to the universal aspirations of our peoples than war and the threat of war Follow Bill on Twitter: @futureshockbb"},{"url":null,"title":"removing-irish-backstop-from-brexit-deal-would-not-be-acceptable-to-eu","story":"Simon Coveney said the European Parliament would not raty an agreement without it, adding: ldquoItrsquos as simple as that.It comes as Mrs May faces another crunch week in Westminster as her deal s to the Commons tomorrow, with a number of MPs tabling amendments to try to change the course of Brexit.The Prime Ministerrsquos deal was dramatically defeated by  votes earlier this month, with much of the criticism focused on the backstop ndash a measure aimed at avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.Speaking on the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr Show, Mr Coveney said: ldquoThe backstop is already a compromise.

As a key member of the European Convention, Kerr wrote Article  of the Lisbon Treaty ndash the clause which triggered Brexit. He was permanent undersecretary at the Foreign Office ndash making him effectively the UKrsquos chief diplomat ndash and he was also our man in Washington and Brussels, serving as ambassador to the United States and as the British representative to the European Union.He also negotiated the Maastricht Treaty with John Major, securing the UKrsquos opt-out from the euro, and negotiated nuclear armaments for Margaret Thatcher at Nato.When the conversation turned to Brexit, this is what he had to say:The mistakesldquoWe didnrsquot know our foe very well, he says of the negotiations ndash not that Kerr sees the EU as an enemy, quite the opposite. ldquoWe didnrsquot study the other side. We thought we could have our cake and eat it. We thought they needed us more than we needed them, that we could pick them off one by one, that the deal could be done in Berlin over a weekend.He speaks incredulously of Brexiteer ministers who ldquodidnrsquot understand that [the  EU member states] would stick together, would stick up for Ireland, would defend the integrity of the single market. These were basic mistakes.A bigger mistake, though, was that ldquowe didnrsquot have a clear vision of where we wanted to end up. We didnrsquot decide how close or far away from the EU we wanted to be. Theresa May, says Kerr, avoided that discussion in Cabinet as ministers would have disagreed ndash until at Chequers last July when she did put forward her proposals resulting in the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson, as Brexit Secretary and Foreign Secretary.Kerr continues with his withering assessment of May: ldquoShe didnrsquot reach out to Parliament, shersquos never tried talking to the opposition to find a common position, shersquos never reached out to the country and explained we canrsquot have our cake and eat it, and shersquos never reached out to Edinburgh, Cardf and Belfast and tried to form a consensus of the four nations.It was ldquomuddling along, he says. ldquoGetting involved in tactical battles without an overall strategy is a big mistake ndash and one that we made.If there have been worse negotiations in history, then Kerr ldquocanrsquot think of one at the moment. Mayrsquos deal is ldquovery humiliating and its parliamentary defeat ldquounprecedented, he says. ldquoWith some of my friends in Brussels, itrsquos quite awkward talking to them now as theyrsquore embarrassed by the scale of their success and our humiliation.Kerr believes civil servants from the Foreign Office should have played a central role in negotiations. He turns his attention to Johnson, Davis and Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary. ldquoI donrsquot think it was a good idea to put Johnson, Fox and Davis in charge of this negotiation, he says. ldquoI think that meant the Prime Minister was slightly cut off from official advice.In comparison, EU officials involved in negotiations ldquowere professionals who knew the European institutions very well. Kerr says the Foreign Office was cut out as it ldquowas not really trusted because it was seen as having been in the past rather in favour of remaining in the EU.ldquoA very serious mistake was made putting Mr Johnson in charge of the Foreign Office, he adds, ldquobecause the Prime Minister clearly didnrsquot trust Mr Johnson, but advice coming from the Foreign Office obviously had to come through Mr Johnson and that probably reduces the chances of that advice being listened to.Kerr points out that ldquothe unity of the  has been remarkable, and thatrsquos partly down to us making it easier for them by never coming forward with any proposals at any stage of the negotiation. We always reacted to proposals from the other side. In negotiation, the power of holding the pen is real ndashyou set the agenda by putting forward the proposals, you donrsquot necessarily get everything you put forward but yoursquore off to a good start. The inability to decide in Cabinet where we wanted to end up meant we never put a proposal on the table. We made speeches in London but we didnrsquot put forward any negotiating documents.What next Kerr now believes that we are heading ldquofor extra time ndash which could only be done through an extension of Article  delaying Brexit ndash and then a second referendum.ldquoI think the muddle wersquore in now is one which canrsquot be sorted by March . I think it may well end up in a second referendum, and I think it should end up in a second referendum as itrsquos now been established that a lot of the promises made in  canrsquot be kept, and people have tumbled to the fact that leaving without a deal would be a very serious economic disruption.ldquoTherersquos also been a very clear rejection of the deal that Mrs May brought back. It follows there should either be a better deal or no Brexit. I think wersquore probably heading for a second referendum.Renegotiation is unlikely. ldquoItrsquos possible a dferent form of Brexit will emerge from Parliament and be negotiated with the EU, says Kerr, ldquobut I donrsquot think so. I think the EU isnrsquot going to make many changes to the deal it spent two years negotiating.As to how a second referendum would go, Kerr says we are in the lap of the gods. ldquoAt present, opinion polls say thattherersquos a referendum tomorrow Remainers would win - but David Cameron was ahead with his remain campaign at the start of the  referendum and he lost.If he was advising the Government hersquod tell them ldquowersquore in a bad mess, the best thing to do is stop and think and ask the people what they want now they can see what leaving means: do they want Mrs Mayrsquos deal, no deal ndash which would be a complete disaster ndash or do they want to stick with the deal wersquove got, full membership of the EU.If Britain chose to remain in Europe ldquono-one could make us pay a price by taking off our rebate or forcing us to join the euro. These threats the leavers talk about, none of them are true. We would pay no price, political or financial,we decided to stay. So I think wersquore heading for a pause for thought, an extension of Article , and a referendum.Scots independenceKerr got involved in the independence referendum because of Europe. ldquoI campaigned against Alex Salmond as I didnrsquot believe him when he saidwe Scots went independent while the UK was in the EU that wersquod be allowed to just pull up another chair at the table, he says.Kerr argued that an independent Scotland would need to apply for EU membership. ldquoI thought that would be perfectly doable, but when Scotland got in it would be on a new memberrsquos terms, he said ndash that would mean no UK-style rebate. ldquoScots would therefore be paying more per head that any Englishman, he said.However, Kerr accepts that ldquothis argument is irrelevantthe UK leaves the EU ndash and that means a big part of the Better Together case collapses.Nevertheless, Kerr remains a strong supporter of the union. ldquoBeing members of the UK multiples Scottish influence. If we left the UK, the economic disruption would be even greater thanas members of the UK we leave the EU.He adds: ldquoEconomists say the effect of leaving the single market of the UK, in terms of the damage to the Scottish economy, would be five times as great as the damage to the UK of leaving the EU.Personally, Kerr says, he wants to be ldquovery Scottish, pretty British, and rather European.Northern IrelandKerr hopes peace holds in Northern Ireland amid the destabilisation of Brexit. ldquoWersquore in a very dangerous country when wersquove stories like the Government thinking of going for some amendment to the Good Friday Agreement as a way of getting around the need for the backstop, he says.ldquoThe Good Friday Agreement is a hugely important achievement and for  years itrsquos worked and we havenrsquot had ato the Troubles. We need to tip-toe around this very carefully and Irsquom not sure all the politicians in London quite understand how fragile the situation is.ldquoItrsquos also a pity that the Government is relying for its majority on the DUP. I think itrsquos quite hard to play the role that John Major and Tony Blair played of being the mediator, the honest broker,yoursquore relying for your political survival on the support of one party which is very sectarian in its support.The far rightKerr says a second referendum would ldquobring some social tensions with hardcore Leavers angry at another vote, but he feels ldquothe social tensions over time of dragging us out of the EU without giving us the chance to say what we want, now the terms are known, would be even more socially disruptive.ldquoYoung people, he says, ldquowould be deeply resentfulthe golden oldies refused them the chance to have another say.Kerr also worries about the effect of English nationalism on the rest of the country. ldquoItrsquos the case that in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to be dragged out because of an English nationalist vote against the EU would breed resentment unless there was another fair test of what the public as a whole wants.ldquoYou get social tension either way, he says. ldquoHowever, we need to face down the worst of it.ldquoIf you look at the history of countries where right-wing populist movements gained force ndash say, the history of s Germany ndash the unwillingness to stand up to thugs, thatrsquos really very dangerous to society. The worst reason for not having a second referendum would bewe were frightened of right-wing populist gangs in the street ndash you have to take a stand against that sort of thing. We live in a liberal democratic country and people should not be blackmailed or bludgeoned into a particular political course by threats from thugs.World viewKerr knows the corridors of power the world over. Today, governments around the globe are bewildered by the UK chucking away influence and prestige.ldquoThe world doesnrsquot quite understand whatrsquos going on, he says. ldquoIt seems to be some breakdown in the UK. He adds: ldquoThe fact we were one of the two most influential states in the EU meant that American presidents listened to us quite a lot as they knewthey could do a deal with us we could probably sell that deal to the EU. It was a multiplier of our influence.ldquoWe were more powerful in Brussels as we were known to be influential in Washington, and we were more influential in Washington as were known to be powerful in Brussels. Our friends in Canberra, Delhi, and Ottawa attached considerable importance to the help we could give them in Brussels, so our friends around the world are a bit confused as to why we would want to give all that up.ldquoI donrsquot think the die is yet cast, though.

Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards.

The government recognises that it will cost £. million to operate our ageing fleet of ferries during - — and that is what we are asking the government to provide.”OIC is also looking to the government to fund the replacement of the current inter-island fleet. The council has been working with the government on this for a number of years and is currently developing a business case setting out the service levels local communities require, and the engineering options needed to achieve these.Councillor Stockan added: “We would object in the strongest possible termswe end up with a reduction in our ferries funding. This would place a wholly disproportionate and unfair burden on the smallest council in Scotland and would mean us having to make cuts to other vital services.“The ferries are a leline for remote and fragile communities across our islands. Orkney has the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — an inequality we cannot address without proper financial support from the Scottish Government.We are calling on the government to take an honourable approach to fulfilling the will of the Scottish Parliament that we should receive fair and equitable funding for our inter-island ferry service. The principle of transferring Orkney’s internal ferry service to the Scottish Government, at no net detriment to OIC, has already been approved by the council. That is a route we will have to take unless we are provided with the funds to run the service over the year ahead.”For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The success of the Dingwall BID depends upon our local businessesrsquo support.ldquoWe are working hard to gather information from all the businesses in Dingwall and we need to hear from everyone. This is your chance to have your say and add to the overall business plan. Then all you have to do is vote yes in the ballot and we can make these projects happen.ldquoWe really want to make sure that nobody is missed and that everyone gets their opportunity to vote because this could be a monumental time in our townrsquos history. This could become the year when Dingwall businesses take control over the townrsquos economic future.Mr Murray said: ldquoWe are aware that there must be a decenton their investment. I believe Highland Council currently collect a wee bit more than pound million per annum from non-domestic ratepayers and Irsquove calculated that the levy would need to be between . to three per cent.ldquoThis would allow us to invoice the council for approximately pound,. Itrsquos also possible we would be able to almost match fund this figure from other sources. This would be an amazing amount banked in Dingwall to be spent on Dingwall. This is how we would fund the five-year plan ready to start after a yes vote.He wants remaining surveys, seeking feedback from businesses to a number of questions, ed by Friday, February .Survey results will then be collated with a five-year business plan set to be drafted by the end of March. A yes no vote on BID would then be held in May.Gordon McIntosh, practice manager of Munro  Noble, is a director of BID Inverness and believes the scheme can pay idends for Dingwall too.He said ldquocoach ambassadors had brought more tourists into the city, increasing spend. It meant local businesses were stakeholders in any centre development plans and have the ability to lobby the council over issues of interest. The scheme also paved the way for successful events such as classic car shows, Easter egg hunts and bar and business awards.He said: ldquoWith representatives from a cross section of businesses on the board the strong advocacy we have provided has achieved some notable results. These results have been for the betterment of our business and social community.

The Four in the Hand was sealed-off with police tape while experts combed it for clues.Officers would not confirm details of the attack but social media users speculated that the bars had been ‘petrol bombed’.One witness posted: “Four in Hand and The Tor both taped off and police there. Petrol bombed.”Another Twitter user wrote: “I see the Four in Hand got petrol bombed last night. Everyone’s home insurance rates around it just went up.”Ex-midfielder Kane later confirmed to the Evening News that his businesses had been attacked.It is understood he was informed that windows were smashed before containers of flammable liquid where thrown in and torched.Vandals previously targeted the Four in the Hand in , weeks after Kane took it over, smashing windows and damaging masonry before daubing it with blue paint.The pub is a favourite haunt of Hibs fans and has been frequented by Pat Stanton and Jimmy O’’Rourke and The Proclaimers.It was previously owned by businessman Kenny McLean Jr, whose father and namesake, a former Hibs vice-chairman, played a leading role in the fight to stop Wallace Mercer buying the club in the s.

Its absence soured debates over the rights of EU citizens. It also explains the bitterness over arguments about the Irish backstop. And it is an absence of trust that has shaped relations between London and Edinburgh since June .As Theresa May casts about for support for her Brexit deal, her latest appeal has been to the Scottish, Welsh and indeed Northern Irish parties in Westminster. Speaking in the House of Commons on  January, she declared that while “it will always be for Her Majesty’s Government to negotiate for the whole of the UK, we are also committed to giving the devolved administrations an enhanced role in the next phase, respecting their competence and vital interests in these negotiations”.On the surface, this was a sensible offer. What really matters in terms of the long-term future of the country is not the Withdrawal Agreement currently stuck in parliamentary gridlock, but the future UK-EU relationship. In offering this ‘enhanced’ role to the devolved administrations, the Prime Minister was trying to dilute their opposition to the former with the promise of consultation over the latter. However, as Professor Nicola McEwen noted, Scotland and Wales don’t even get a passing mention in the political declaration, despite it having massive implications for devolved policy areas.Having proffered an olive branch, May then proceeded to snatch it away. After a meeting in Downing Street last week, the First Minister reported that the Prime Minister “was keener to rule out the things she wasn’t prepared to do – extend Article , contemplate a second EU referendum” than to discuss the red lines she had laid down unilaterally back in .Indeed, the UK Government’s only substantive offer was for Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford to attend new Cabinet sub-committee meetings on preparing for the UK’s exit from the EU. “Watch us implement policies we defined despite your objections” is hardly the most enticing proposition.: Brexit: Philip Hammond refuses to rule out quitting in event of no-dealSo far, so predictable. This is typical May. It has been a striking — and, at least since she lost her majority in , dysal — aspect of her style that she is more comfortable ruling options out than opening them up. She has proved happy to make concessions on process as long as it is process heading in a direction she alone has determined.Think back for a second. Immediately after moving into Downing Street, May made her first visit as Prime Minister to Scotland. She stressed her willingness to listen to options and declared her wish to see the Scottish Government “fully engaged in our discussion”. She then proceeded to lay down a series of red lines that directly contradicted the expressed preferences of the Scottish Government to stay in the single market and customs union.The UK Government then published its EUBill, which managed to unite Carwyn Jones and Nicola Sturgeon in describing it as a “naked power grab” by Westminster.The Withdrawal Bill underlined not only the fragility of the devolution settlement, but also the willingness of London to tinker with it as it saw fit. PersonallyI suspect this was more an overwhelmed civil service trying to simply the Brexit process rather than a deliberate attempt to sabotage devolution.: Brexit: Why People’s Vote campaign is failing – Paris GourtsoyannisWhatever the truth, the Withdrawal Bill involved the relocation of powers previously held in Belfast, Cardf and Edinburgh to London as “retained EU law”. The Scottish Parliament refused consent for the EUBill and passed its own Continuity Bill, and the UK Government took the Scottish Government to the Supreme Court. The latter ruled before Christmas that the Bill was legitimate, but that placing requirements on UK ministers was not. Negotiations in court rooms, as opposed to smoke-filled rooms, is rarely a recipe for building trust.Meanwhile, in December MSPs voted by  to  to reject Theresa May’s Brexit deal. Whatever happens in Westminster, evenTheresa May can Houdini herself out of the current bind, this will not be a Brexit deal that has the consent of all parts of the UK.As one might expect, the handling of Brexit by the Government in London has not endeared May to the Scottish public. A large majority are less than impressed by the Prime Minister, with  per cent believing she is doing badly or very badly. By last October, a majorityalso viewed her either unfavourably or very unfavourably. That’s not to say Nicola Sturgeon has had things all her own way either. Brexit and what many view as the shoddy treatment of the devolved settlement has not translated into increased support for independence. As researcher Ian Montagu has explained, this has remained remarkably stable, despite increasing irritation at the Government in Westminster. And the SNP faces a dilemma of their own: according to the Scottish Social Attitudes survey, around half of independence supporters are also Eurosceptic. Between  and , the SNP’s support among this group fell by  percentage points while remaining steady among Europhiles.The creation of this schism in Sturgeon’s electoral coalition is a political problem for the SNP. Yet, May’s uncompromising style, and an inability to build up trust in the last two years, has deepened the schism between Westminster and Edinburgh. The Prime Minister’s inability to build trust through compromise could well be the character flaw that trumps her unionist instincts.Anand Menon is director of The UK in a Changing Europeand professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London.

Having taken a wide range of evidence on the implications of a no-deal Brexit, the committee is clear this cannot be allowed to happen.”The Leeds Central Labour MP continued: “The suggestion that the UK might opt for a no-deal outcome but assume that the EU will continue to act in a co-operative manner to avoid disruption, cannot seriously constitute the policy of any responsible Government.“MPs must be able to vote on extending Article Parliament cannot reach agreement on a way forward before  March.”Cabinet isions over a no-deal exit from the EU have resurfaced, with the Education Secretary Damian Hinds saying he could not envisage the government supporting a no-deal Brexit.His comments came after Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom branded attempts by MPs to kill no deal as an option, through a series of Commons amendments on Tuesday, as a “thinly veiled attempt to stop Brexit”.“I don’t envisage no deal becoming Government policy,” Mr Hinds told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday. “We want to avoid a no deal.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players from throughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams from Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face. to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

Since that first big hit, the band ed to the charts  more times with other songs, nevertheless, the magic of ‘The Unicorn’ remains.To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary, the Rovers are releasing ‘The Unicorn, The Continuing Story’.It includes all new recordings, plus the sequel to the original song, which answers the question of the last fty years.A new music video also tells the story.The World Wildle Fund, and wildle cinematographer Adam Ravetch assisted in the production. Since the s, the Celtic super-group have travelled the world as musical ambassadors - with performances from as far apart as the Arctic Circle, Japan, and Germany, with regular tours to Australia, New Zealand, and the US.The Rovers first became known in the US in the s on shows like The Tonight Show, The Smothers Brothers, Mike Douglas Show, The Dating Game , and even starring in The Virginian.In the s they hosted their first of three international television series, ‘The Irish Rovers Show’ and throughout the next  years their weekly television shows brought Ireland into living rooms of America and the rest of the world.More recently, their  Drunken Sailor album went viral on YouTube, made news headlines back home in Belfast and put them back on radio across North America with a new younger generation audience.A Canadian CBC producer saw the Belfast news articles about the Rovers new song and video and asked George Millar to sing his new song ‘The Titanic’ to help their telling of the th Anniversary of Titanic. The   Years triple CD broke tour sales records, while the lads ed to the small screen with three North American television specials, ‘The Irish Rovers Home In Ireland’, ‘The Irish Rovers Christmas’, ‘The Irish Rovers LIVE on St. Patrick’s Day  th Anniversary Special’, all produced in the last few years.The days of the long tours are finally coming to an end for these Irish lads as they are now completing one last world tour.

We regard this as the most important constitutional gathering in a generation,” he said.The conference comes as uncertainty continues to remain over the issue of the Irish border backstop along with the need to ensure EU rights are protected after Brexit.Last November one thousand prominent nationalistsportspeople, artists, actors and leading business heads put their signatories to an open letter to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar outlining their concerns.

But, after representations from his solicitor, it was agreed that the fine would be waived when it was learned that no tax book had been available for the vehicle.He was held for an hour and a half in Dunmurry and was released when a relative arrived and paid the fine.The RUC men – one of whom was in plain clothes – had arrived in the area in a red Vauxhall car without markings.One Twinbrook resident said later: “So much for the RUC’s concern about the peace talks. They wouldn’t have done that sort of thing before the ceasefire.”Order is expected soon for new IRA ceasefireA NEW ceasefire order is expected to be issued to all IRA units within the next  hours. But a formal announcement by the Republican Army Council is not expected until early next week.The decision to order a ceasefire came after a second round of talks between senior Stormont and republican officials at a secret venue about five miles from Belfast on Wednesday night.In a statement issued late on Wednesday Britain’s supremo here, Merlyn Rees, said: “I am sure that the people of Northern Ireland would wish to see effective arrangements made to ensure that the ceasefire did not break down. I attach very great importance to this, and practical arrangements would be necessary.”Republican leaders are now believed to regard this as a sufficient gesture to allow them to order another ceasefire.But it is believed that they will want meaningful talks on a number of issues shortly after their ceasefire is publicly announced. Another reason why a new ceasefire is possible has been the low profile approach adopted by the British Army since the shock announcement last week that the truce was off.A key factor in the decision to call off the Christmas ceasefire was the behaviour of British units in Belfast and several rural areas where they stepped up their activity to take advantage of the ceasefire.British leaders in London are known to have been surprised at the IRA decision and there has been speculation that advice from their military leaders – who had claimed that the IRA ceasefire was certain to continue because the IRA was beaten – is now being ignored by Westminster leaders.British Premier Wilson is said to have been furious that the much-vaunted military intelligence network in Ireland was totally unaware that the ceasefire was in danger.And parallels are being drawn between the military intelligence blunder of last week and similar blunders before Internment Day and Operation Motorman – when politicians were advised that both moves would “help solve the Irish question”. IN a front page article in the Sunday World this week reporter John Keane disclosed that the , political prisoners in the Long Kesh internment camp are being held in huts which would be regarded by the EEC farming officials as unsuitable for pighouses.AdvertisementsHUNTING LODGEScotch from £.Vodka from £.Gin from £.Double litre Italian wine £.Full range of winesCans Skol p  doz Packs Lager pBrandy from £.Hennessy Brandy at £.Plus an extensive range of LiquersLámh Dearg GAC Social Club Behind Watters old pub at the top of Hannahstown Hill.A great night of singing and dancing on Sunday.ROMANOSSaturday  January - – From the top of the charts KENNYSaturday  February GLITTER BAND."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"our playground was upton cottages and arizona street","story":"IN March , an ‘Arizona Street and Upton Cottages reunion party’ was held in the Glenowen. It was a great event, with fantastic music provided by the McCourt brothers, and some equally impressive socialising done by the McKays, McDonalds, Quinns, McAteers, Pattersons, Monaghans, Lintons# and plenty of others, including a couple of Deedses.The oldest party-goer was Mrs Sheila Deane, at a brave  years of age. I got speaking to MrsDeane that night and as always, she had a smile on her face and was in good spirits. Sadly, MrsDeane passed away on January this year.The street was our playground growing up in Arizona Street Upton Cottage in the ‘s and ‘s. We were never in. While our parents probably appreciated this, I’m not sure that all of the older residents enjoyed the noise and occasional nuisance as much. Some of our older neighbours when passing might have greeted us young ones with no more than a scowl, a grunt, or even worse . Mrs Deane however, was friendly and approachable every time you saw her. Uniquely as well, she always remembered my name. My brothers and I were very good friends with MrsDeane’s grandsons Neil, David and Mark, just down the street. Every night since I can remember, their dad Seamus made the short trek up the street past our house to visit his mum in the cottages. I spoke to Seamus recently and he kindly shared some of his own, earlier childhood memories of our wee street.Mr and Mrs Deane moved in to number  Upton Cottages on the Glen Road in , and at that time the street was still not too dissimilar from the way it looked when the houses were first built. Upton Cottages first appears in Belfast Street directories in , when they formed the only small terrace resembling a street anywhere in West Belfast beyond the Falls Road. At that time, and for almost another  years, the area beyond Upton Cottages marked the start of the country, and there was very little to be found after it going up the Glen Road apart from farms and fields. The single-sided Arizona Driveappears in the street directories for the first time in , with the opposite side and new name of Arizona Street listed the following year. Several other homes of ying size soon began to spring up along the Glen Road around the growing parish of St Teresa’s. Gransha and Andersonstown estates followed shortly after and the whole area became much less rural in character. One former resident of Woodland House on the Upper Springfield Road remembered walking down the Turf Loney to go to Sunday school on the Glen Road in the s, only to be chased back across the stream at Upton Cottages for being ‘country children’!Still, in  the area was unrecognisable from how it looks today. Beyond the cottages was all fields going right up from the Falls to Hannahstown Hill. Before Turf Lodge was built to meet the rapidly increasing demand for social housing in West Belfast, Seamus Deane remembers playing from dawn to dusk in the meadows there throughout his childhood. Arizona Street, Seamus recalls, was still only three quarters built in the ‘s. In fact, the house that I grew up in near the top, and any others after number , were built around a decade later. These were known as the ‘corporation houses’, having been appended to the existing houses by the council in the ‘s. In the s Sheila Deane and her family looked out at a single four bedroom house – number  Upton Cottages and the first on that side – beside which was Sherf’s timber yard . Both sites would later be taken up by McErlean’s Bakery that employed generations of the area’s youth. Before the bakery was built however, long piles of timber from Sherf’s yard lay in the field between the Deanes’ house and the bottom half of Arizona Street. The vacant ground beside it, part of which would one day become our back garden, was the site of the annual bonfire. According to one older resident, there had been an orchard there in even earlier times. Geraldine Mallonwho told me this was someone I was heart scared of as a child. She and the neighbour facing her, Jim Butler, were tortured by us kids kicking balls and hitting sliotars around their doors. And they were never too slow in coming out to tell us to take them away to hell’s gates. Ironically, both Jim and Geraldine became good neighbours of mine when I got older and moved in beside them, and we stayed friendly until they passed away in recent years.Other former residents of Upton Cottages include members of the RIC, a private in the Free State Army and two soldiers who lost their lives in the First World War, one of whom is among the Canadian Infantry buried in the City Cemetery.And the street keeps changing. Like so many other families, MrsDeane’s children and grandchildren are scattered near and far. Her sons Paul and Seamus continued to make their daily pilgrimage up our street back home to see their mum until her final days. This special lady won’t be forgotten, nor will our memories of a grand wee community – one of the last of its kind – that has spread out across our beautul former meadows from the Falls to Hannahstown, and further afield."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"toibin to host new party belfast meeting","story":"FORMER Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín has said that his new party hopes to select candidates for the North’s upcoming Council elections by early February.The Meath TD left Sinn Féin in November over the party’s decision to back legislation allowing for abortion.The as yet unnamed party is set to host a meeting at the Malone Lodge in Belfast this Monday with a view to setting up local branches.Speaking to the Daily Belfast ahead of the meeting, Mr Tóibín said it was not his intention to “clip the ear off” Sinn Féin based on his past experience, but rather to build a “broader” republican party.“I believe over the last year that Sinn Féin has narrowed its ideological space, both economically and socially,” he said.“It has flipped its policy on a number of social issues. In , the party would have been openly pro-le. In , they’ve gone the opposite direction.“I also battled internally for the last two years to make sure I could be part of the Oireachtas team on an equal basis, but because I had a dference of opinion on the issue of abortion that just wasn’t allowed. I wasn’t given the chance to equally participate in the organisation.“For example, the leadership of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill and Mary Lou, went to London recently and asked Westminster to legislate on three separate areas for the North of Ireland – that’s unheard of in republican terms. For  years republicans have tried to stop them legislating on Ireland.”He continued: “The party is also caught in a way in that it wants to reach middle-Ireland more, maybe looking at winning seats in leafy liberal Dublinit can, reaching out to the media too, but there is a big danger that it will lose its grassroots base. I think the Presidential campaign was an example of where the grassroots became so disempowered that they didn’t come out for the organisation.”Mr Tóibín insists that Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Fianna Fáil, and Labour have positioned themselves on the same space, and that his party hopes to attract disillusioned members. Asked about his party’s policies, beyond being pro-le, Mr Tóibín said: “We are for the unity of the Irish people North and South and we will be reaching out the hand of friendship to people from a Protestant background, people who wouldn’t have been able to vote for Sinn Féin in the past, for many reasons. “We’ll also be reaching out to people who believe that the Tories have made such balderdash of Brexit, and have had their rights to self-determination taken away with regards to remaining in the EU. For us, economic justice issues are very important. Right now we have people in the North who are in food poverty, housing poverty, health poverty and yet we have stalemate at Stormont.”He contined: “We need the governments to institute joint authority in the North. We also need to make sure that there is serious work done on the All-Ireland economy. It was sold to us as part of the Good Friday Agreement, but it had fallen off the agenda for many political parties. It will be one of the greatest tools toameliorate the effects of Brexit. “Another point, and I think, Sinn Féin have been remiss on this, we want an independence referendum, but we can start to deconstruct the border in the meantime. “The border is made up of thousands of dferent bricks, which stand for a practical experience in someone’s le. It could be a cross-border ambulance service, a cross-border health service, cross-border education, or corporation tax – a cross-border soccer team. Every time we fix those issues, we create convergence North and South, we improve the delivery of services and the quality of le for people, and the height of the border starts to reduce in height.”Mr Tóibín has said his party hopes to stand between  to  candidates across Ireland, and has already attracted nine elected councillors. Asked about the number of candidates standing in Belfast, Mr Tóibín said: “We won’t get into the micro details just yet. Hundreds of people are joining us on a weekly basis. New cumainn are being set up around the country, and we have new cumainn that will be set up in Belfast. “We want to make sure that we are an activist based grassroots organisation. If we get that infrastructure set up around the six counties then we hope to be selecting candidates by early February in places we believe we can win seats.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-24-at-16.25.07.png","title":"womens place in national debate","story":"LAST year was a year to remember for women’s rights. ‘Me Too’ was a phrase heard around the globe as artists in many spheres made sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination visible. It was a lesson that went way beyond the arts.The referendum on the th Amendment to the Irish constitution made the experience of women visible in multiple ways. It was not merely about the personal heartbreak of inidual women, it was also about systemic oppression of Irish women and children, and reached into the earth of Tuam, County Galway, where babies’ bodies had been buried in an unconsecrated septic tank by nuns and priests.It was the year that celebrated  years of some women’s franchise and paid homage to suffragettes and the first woman MP, Constance Markievitz.With the election of Clare Bailey as leader of the Green Party we now have women leaders of four of the six mainparties. In many ways it all seemed seminal. That women’s agendas could no longer be ignored. However, we are all too aware of its limitations too. The words ‘The North is Next’ regarding access to full choices in pregnancy clearly require the addition of ‘at some point’.Women’s participation in politics, while improving, remains poor. In the forthcoming council election watch how many women are standing in winnable seats and watch which parties do what. A fair enough group photo of gender balance announcing candidates is often at quite a distance from the elected officials’ photograph afterwards.Just as in , contemporary strides on women’s rights need to be carefully looked after in the years to come. While Cumann na mBan and feminism were integral to the operation of the First Dáil and the appropriation of public le during the Tan War, what we witnessed afterwards was an assault on women’s rights, from the constitution to the maternity ward afterwards. In the north the oppression of women went hand in glove with the oppression of the nationalist population in the right wing statelet.Right now, there is a conversation happening about what a new Ireland might look like. The conversation focuses on constitutional rights, economic interests and demographics. Campaigns feed into it with social and cultural rights featuring intermittently.What we have failed to do is insert the vibrant and rich debate last year on women’s rights into this national debate in the meaningful way. For instance, women who cannot be equal participants in our society because their citizenship and culture are denied to them are doubly oppressed as women are unequal participants in so many avenues of le.Just as in - when Irish suffragettes gave expression to their fight for self-determination being linked to their country’s fight for self-determination, we need to seek out space and language for a modern Irish women’s vision. Indeed, in those years Irish suffragettes’ colours were not purple white and green – they were orange, white and green. It was a bold statement of intent: that women would not be written out of the Proclamation or a new Ireland.That new Ireland was never realised with the imposition of partition. Specic attention must now be paid to women’s participation, needs and aspirations as we build our new vision for a transformed Ireland."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37735955.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/ph.jpg","title":"3600 a day to keep the lights and heat on at a stormont that hasnt functioned for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So it would be foolhardy to follow that up with the border poll. Thats not helpful.\"A border poll would be a colossal undertaking. No one in government in the south is looking at the practicalities of a border poll. There is no plan.\"The Kerry senator compiled his report in  for a Seanad committee tasked with looking at the impact of Brexit on the Republic, which also set out proposals for peaceful reunication.Ms McDonald told the conference that crashing out of the EU with no deal in place would lead to a hardening of the border.\"A hardening of the border is inconceivable and will be met with the demand for a unity referendum,\" she said.\"We dont exactly know what will happen over the next few weeks or months. Its not in our hands, its in the hands of a minority Tory Government in London, and that is the crux of the problem.\"Its irresponsible and arrogant for a Dublin Government to shout down any prospect of a unity referendum.\"While there were no unionist politicians speaking at the event, Ms McDonald issued a direct message to the unionist community saying they would \"have a home in a united Ireland\".SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, however, said now was not the right time for a border poll.\"There are unionists who are willing to engage and explore new possibilities,\" he said.\"Unionism should have nothing to fear in a conversation based on persuasion and consent.

It was designed around British red lines.\"Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the Withdrawal Agreement is part of a balanced package that isnt going to change.\"Health Secretary Matt Hancock denied Mr Coveneys comments meant Mrs Mays Brexit deal was \"dead in the water\".\"Not at all,\" said Mr Hancock. \"Thats a negotiating position the Irish are taking, but I think its also extremely clear from that interview and the tone... Ireland doesnt want to have a no-deal Brexit.\"The whole purpose of the backstop is to avoid a hard border, which risks being a consequence of a no-deal Brexit.\"The idea the EU and the Irish Government would drive this process to a no-deal exit in order to try to achieve something which is intended to avoid no-deal Brexit, that is not going to happen.\"Education Secretary Damian Hinds told Sky News: \"There are multiple reasons to believe the backstop would never come into place. And, evenit did, actually there are some advantages to the backstop as well as drawbacks.\"However, Brexiteer Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns said she wanted the PM to abandon the backstop, telling Sky News: \"Id like to see her bin the backstop. I think we need to bin it completely.\"The backstop would see the UK remain under EU customs rulesa wider trade agreement had not been reached after a transition period.Tory Brexiteers have tabled Commons amendments calling for major changes to the backstop, including the imposition of an end date for it.Tory MP Andrew Murrison wants a deadline of the end of December  put on the \"backstop\" proposal intended to avoid a hard border in Ireland.Backed by Tory grandees like  Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady, it is believed to be viewed favourably by Downing Street as a way of showing Brussels that the Withdrawal Agreement could get through the Commonsconcessions are made over Northern Ireland.Another amendment from Dr Murrison seeks the backstop to be \"replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border\".Commons Speaker John Bercow will decidethe backstop amendments get to be voted on by MPs when the PMs Brexit stance is again considered in Parliament tomorrow.The Alliance Party warned attempts to pass Parliamentary amendments to restrict or change the backstop would only serve to waste time and increase the risk of a no-deal Brexit.Brexit spokesman Stephen Farry MLA said: \"There is increased speculation the Conservatives and DUP are trying to unite around demands for major changes to the backstop. \"This approach is a dead-end. It would not constitute majority support to advance the Withdrawal Agreement, but rather an action to undermine it.\"The tensions emerged as it was revealed preparations are being looked at for the possible imposition of martial law after a no-deal Brexit.The move has been described by sources as the civil service \"prepping\" for all possibilities.Mr Hancock denied the government was \"specically\" planning for martial law but did not rule it out.\"I wouldnt put a stress on that,\" he said. \"Of course government all the time looks at all the options in all circumstances.\"He distanced himself from leaked comments in November claiming he had said he could not guarantee patients would not die in a no-deal scenario.\"I didnt quite say that,\" he said. \"Cabinet discussions are meant to be secret.\""},{"url":null,"title":"exira bomber who got 30 life sentences has words of advice for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As a young Provisional IRA member you bombed Derry into the ground in the s. What is your response to the recent New IRA attack on the citys courthouse  https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland exira-bomber-who-got--le-sentences-has-words-of-advice-for-young-dissidents-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph le features article.ece d AUTOCROP h --_l__I.JPGEmailQ. As a young Provisional IRA member you bombed Derry into the ground in the s. What is your response to the recent New IRA attack on the citys courthouse .pushA. It makes me incredibly sad that another generation of young men and women are going down that path. There will be older people mentoring them who are exploiting them. I believe they are cannon fodder for a leadership that will use them.It is reckless revisiting violence. The nationalist community in Derry, who have suffered so much and have gained nothing from the peace process, deserve better than starting this endless cycle all over again.Nobody was killed this time but planting bombs inevitably leads to injuries and deaths. I would say to young dissidents that you lose a universe by taking le, and dont gain a single speck of territory. If you go down this route, you end up a civil and human rights abuser.Q. Given your past history, theyll say youre a hypocrite.A. Well, Ive publicly condemned all my own past activities. Ive apologised to my victims and worked tirelessly to try to convince paramilitaries to give up violence.Q. Are todays dissident republican groups any dferent from the IRA you belonged to A. No, theyre not. Just as that IRA was no dferent to the one that fought the War of Independence and the Irish Civil War. I suppose the only dference between the dissidents and the Provos is that so far the dissidents havent chained anyone to a bomb.Q. Why do you think dissident republican groups in Derry can attract members  years after the IRA ceasefire A. One reason is anger at the corruption in the Provisional IRA which has seen some leaders get rich and run businesses not through their own graft.There has also been a failure to deliver anything to the west bank of Derry in terms of jobs, a motorway and a proper railway line. But the British presence in Northern Ireland remains the main driving force for dissidents, its certainly not Brexit.Q. Tell me about your family background.A. I was born in , the second youngest of eight children. We were a middle-class family. My father was a school teacher and my mother came from a prominent business family. We lived in a Georgian terrace in what would be regarded as a snobby street.There was some history of republicanism on my fathers side but we were definitely not a republican family.Q. So why did you join the IRA A. As a boy I devoured books on Irish history in my fathers library. I found  and Pearse and Connolly particularly spellbinding. I wrote a pledge on a sheet of paper when I was  vowing to \"fight andnecessary die for Irelands freedom\". I hid it under the floor boards. Years later when I was arrested the police brought me this yellowed strip of paper and I was deeply embarrassed.My actual joining, though, was very spur of the moment. I was walking home from school and a friend said he was doing it the next day and askedI wanted to. I said I would. A rapid decision that had horrendous consequences. I was  years old, and I think the use of child soldiers by the IRA, or any army, is immoral.Q. What did you do as a young IRA member A. I learned to make incendiaries with condoms, acid and other chemicals. I didnt even know the real purpose of condoms. I thought they actually were intended for incendiary devices.I burned down shops. Myself and others took on Army patrols with handguns. It was crazy.Q. Did you have any doubts about what you were doing A. I fell away from the IRA for a bit, but Bloody Sundayhappened a week after my th birthday and it brought me back. I was with a friend, dawdling along like at any other civil rights march, looking at the girls from Thornhill College. Then the Paras started shooting.Bodies of civilians were lying on the ground. I ran like the blazes and hid behind a wall. I went with a priest to the morgue at Altnagelvin Hospital. Senior Army and police officers were laughing and joking about the dead outside. I thought Id rather be lying on a mortuary slab for doing something than for doing nothing.Q. But the IRA wouldnt take you back A. They had so many adults they didnt need me. I was being hassled by the British Army and I moved down South. I wanted back into the IRA. I went to see Martin McGuinness who was being held in the Bridewell . I had red hair and I pretended to be his younger brother to get in. I told him: \"I want to go back to the North to rock and roll.\" He said: \"Away you go.\"Q. What was the young Martin McGuinness like A. He was very idealistic, and a straight-up character who didnt drink or smoke. He was extremely shy. People laughed when he got his first girlfriend, Bernie. On a personal level, I liked him.I find it very hard to reconcile that Martin with the one who sanctioned human bombs, the torture of informers, the murder of census collector Joanne Mathers and many other atrocities.He served only two very brief prison sentences. I think it would have been better had he done a long stretch in jail. That causes people to reflect. Guys who did time confront what they did. Theyre not in denial.Martin told lies too. He was active on Bloody Sunday. He did not leave the IRA in . Im tremendously sorry that he never managed to be reconciled to his victims. Right up until the end he had the chance to tell the truth about atrocities like Claudy and to clear his conscience. He chose not to.Q. Back in IRA ranks, what did you do A. I tried shooting but I wasnt much good at it. I was great with explosives and not a lot of people wanted to work in that area given the risks. I bombed shops, banks, and police stations.I developed the letter bomb in . Id seen an article in The Sunday Times about how the PLO used them. I actually blew myself up in a house in the Creggan - went right through the window and into the garden. I damaged my eye and a finger.I was treated in a Dublin hospital. When I was there Martin visited and introduced me to the IRA GHQ figure in charge of bombing England. They said they wanted me to go to London. Hugh Feeney, Gerry Kelly and the Price sisters had just been captured after bombing the Old Bailey.Q. Tell me about bombing England.A. I sent dozens and dozens of letter bombs. To Downing Street, the Bank of England, the Stock Exchange, judges, generals, and the Home Secretary Reginald Maudling, whom I held responsible for Bloody Sunday. He was injured opening it. This was the politics of revenge. An eye for an eye.Q. How do you view those actions now A. With horror. I was arrested and charged in  and at my trial those who were injured made statements.I had never considered that some of my targets mightnt open the letters, that secretaries would. An Irish woman in the British embassy in Washington lost a hand. Other people were blinded.I apologised in court to the \"innocent working-class victims who were accidentally injured\".I think it was the first time an IRA man had done this.But what I am most ashamed of was planting a bomb in an Oxford Street shop. I had phoned a warning to police twice but they didnt take it seriously and told me to \"f*** off\". I should have gone back to the store and cleared out the customers. I didnt. It could have been an atrocity.Q. Describe how your views on violence changed.A. It wasnt a road to Damascus conversion, it was much more gradual. I had doubts back in Derry and Id voted for the  IRA ceasefire. But it was a Jesuit priest in Wormwood Scrubs who changed my le. He was known as an anti-Irish bigot and we were always arguing. During one big row I said to him: \"Wheres the proof your God exists \" He gave me a copy of the Bible. Reading the four gospels about JCchanged my le. The holy fear of God blew me away.Eddie Dalysent me a book about a former SAS soldier who discovered Padre Pio and that affected me too. I repented.Q. What did your religious conversion lead you to do A. I wrote to my victims to apologise. Some of them gave those letters to the News of the World and I was all over the media. In  I sent a letter to Republican News saying the armed struggle was immoral. I said the war should be ended in favour of democratic politics. They refused to print it but Eddie Daly gave it to the Derry Journal, who did.It was a very big step for an IRA member to take. There was one IRA figure on the wing who wanted me killed in my cell.Q. How long were you in jail A. I received  le sentences plus  years. I spent  years in jail in England. One of the most positive experiences there was meeting some of the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four.They were very down and didnt know how to campaign to prove their innocence. I helped them write letters to the media. I put them in touch with the solicitor Gareth Peirce.In  I was repatriated to Northern Ireland where I spent four years in jail. I was sent to Long Kesh, where I refused to go onto the IRA wing. I didnt want to live under paramilitary control.I was put in with sex offenders, but I think I was an example to lots of other prisoners and soon the wing was full of both republican and loyalist conforming prisoners. We were eventually moved to Maghaberry.Q. Tell me about le after jail.A. I went to study English at Trinity College Dublin. I later did an MSc in computer science. In  I married Michelle Sweeney, a student from Chicago I had met at Trinity.I got a job in computer software. I also edited the Big Issue and worked with the homeless. Michelle got a job in the US and moved back there. I tried to join her but I couldnt get a visa because of my IRA record.Id been in and out of the US for years, but after   everything changed. Michelle sought a orce and the marriage was later annulled.Q. What did you do after that A. I worked in Stockholm in IT and earned great money, but I wanted toto Dublin. I believed I had a vocation to become a priest and entered Maynooth in , but I left two years later.I ed to working with a homeless service dealing with drug and heroin addictions.In  I married Suzie Sweeney, a Scots woman who was a medical practice manager in Co Westmeath.Two years ago I decided to give up my job in the homeless sector to work on faith issues. Suzie did the same. We lived in Roscommon for a while, but now we move around. We are currently based in Spain.I give talks about my le story and repentance to students on behalf of a Spanish charity whose patron is tennis star Rafael Nadal.Q. In a  RTE interview, while continuing to oppose \"armed struggle\", you voiced strong republican views against partition and spoke of \"the territorial integrity of Ireland\". You said you didnt vote Sinn Fein but expressed admiration for those in the party who \"risked their lives to bring peace\". You now oppose republican politics and denounce Sinn Fein. Why have your opinions changed A. Ive outgrown the territory argument of republicanism. Its a very powerful one but I think politics should be about uniting hearts and minds, not a piece of land. John Hume nailed it a long time ago.I was a strong supporter of the peace process and gave Sinn Fein the benefit of the doubt. I became very disillusioned with them when they pulled out of Stormont. They continue to stay out at a time nationalists most need a voice.Also, I made a programme for RTE which led families of people killed in IRA bombs to approach me seeking help. I was shocked to find Sinn Fein was doing nothing for them. I think Id been fooled into believing they would give victims the restitution of truth.The Volunteer: A Former IRA Mans True Story by Shane Paul ODoherty, Strategic Book Publishing  Rights Agency, £."},{"url":null,"title":"game of thrones dark hedges loses another tree to weather","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Causeway Coast and Glens councillor Joan Baird said she believes heavy numbers of tourists are contributing to the \"terrible loss\" for the Armoy site. \"These are very old trees, but cars and buses driving over their roots has been a problem that has taken too long to solve,\" she said. Branches were ripped off the trees by similar gusts during Storm Hector last June. Ms Baird warned at that time that trees would topple unless crowd control measures were implemented - now she is warning more could be lost. \"The vast numbers of visitors and the amount of cars is damaging the roots - it forces them to bend and squeeze in, which weakens the trees,\" she said. \"We need to hurry up and build an underpass from the nearby hotel car park to preserve these trees and the tourism benefits they bring.\"Fans from all over the world flock to Kings Road on the Bregagh Road to get a picture in front of the haunting backdrop.Less than two thirds of the  trees planted along the entrance to the Stuart familys Gracehill House mansion more than two centuries ago remain standing. The famous tunnel of trees - which provided Arya Stark with her escape route from Kings Landing - is counted among the top  most-Instagrammed locations here, ranking even higher than Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge.

There is an obligation on people to actually have pragmatic solutions rather than wishful thinking.\"He said Ireland \"will insist\" the UK keeps its word to the people of Northern Ireland and the way to overcome the obstacles was through the future relations talks during the transition period.\"The backstop is already a compromise. It is a series of compromises. It was designed around British red lines,\" he said.\"Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement is part of a balanced package that isnt going to change.\"However responding, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said delaying Brexit would not resolve the issues.

He said Mr Varadkar was reminding people of what the border once looked like.\"What I would ask people to think about is how far we have come in the last  years and what the peace agreement has done for relationships between our two island. Lets not go backwards and cause tension,\" He said.\"Lets not just listen to one political partys voice from Northern Ireland because they happen to sit in Westminster. Lets listen everybody in Northern Ireland is saying.

There have been more than a dozen amendments tabled including ensuring there can be no departure in a no deal, delaying Brexit and binning the backstop and looking for \"alternative arrangements\".\"There is no magic solution here for this problem,\" Mr Coveney continued.\"If there was it would have emerged by now and that is why Ireland will insist on the UK keeping its word to Ireland, the EU and the people of Northern Ireland in terms of protecting a fragile but hugely valuable peace process.\"Askedthe Commons voted on finding alternative arrangements to the backstop, would the withdrawal agreement be \"holy text\" and untouchable the TD said that would be like asking Ireland to renege on its commitments and instead replace them with a hope something would be found.Listen to what the people of Europe are saying.FacebookTwitterHe said the way to tackle the issues was in the future trade relations talks.\"That is the way I hope these negotiations will go rather than the British parliament deciding on something that may command a majority in Westminster but has no chance of getting agreement or ratication in the EU.\"Listen to what people are saying in Europe. This is not just about Britains future. This is about how we work together in the future.\"He added: \"People keep talking about games of chicken and the UK position being against the Irish or the EU position. We are all trying to work together here.\"Britain and Ireland are two islands next door to each other, we have an extraordinary history at times a very tragic history. But we have to work out these things together and stop talking about games of chicken.\"Mr Coveney said he did not believe the only reason for Theresa Mays crushing defeat in the Commons earlier this month was down to the backstop alone.\"If you look at the withdrawal agreement it is actually not that controversial. It is about protecting citizens rights.. about protecting British citizens rights in the EU .. its about a financial settlement.. its about creating the time and space for a transition period.. for preparing for new realities.\"And its about protecting a peace process which I believe the Prime Minister is deeply committed to.\"He added: \"The problem with the argument is that nobody has come up with a pragmatic, sensible and legally sound way of avoiding border infrastructure reemerging between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. And that is why it took two years to get the backstop agreed and that is why I believe the Prime Minister is correct when she defends it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"irish government rejects mays bid for brexit backstop concessions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said he wanted to try to get a general election, he tried that and failed. “It seems to me it’s incumbent on Labour to make its position on this clear –it does so then I do think there would possibly be a majority in the House of Commons so Labour, at the moment, are the block to that and I think that’s deeply regrettable. “We’ll have to wait and see what Labour’s position would be.

That remains the case. “Obviously Labour have to be willing to work with the SNP as well as the SNP being willing to work with Labour. “Until now the blockage to working together like that has come from the Labour side but I would always do whatever I could as leader of the SNP to keep the Tories out of Downing Street.”"},{"url":null,"title":"couple tackle disability misconceptions with youtube channel","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder. The line out was won, but Malone forced a crucial turnover and the chance went begging.Both sides continued to be careless in possession in a niggly match, which was low on quality.On  minutes a Malone breakdown penalty gave lsquoHinch a chance to drive for the line and as they progressed, Malone blatantly killed the ball and could count themselves lucky not to receive a yellow. Wright slotted the penalty to close the gap to two points.Following a Malone penalty miss, lsquoHinch botched their own line out allowing the home side to pile into the . Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card. Malone then scored from a tap penalty to take a - half-time lead.The second half followed a similar pattern to the first with Ballynahinch going further behind to another try from the prolic Campbell after another lsquoHinch mistake on their own line out.Ross Adair reduced the arrears on  minutes with a converted try to put lsquoHinch in bonus point territory and the away side belatedly roused themselves to pile the pressure on Malone during the final ten minutes.However, the home defence held and lsquoHinch had to settle for a point, earned largely through the woes of the Malone place kicker, who failed to land any of his attempts on goal.A disappointing start to  for the locals and they will need to be more accurate this week as Ballymena come to Ballymacarn Park.Malone Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygowan’s Emma hoping to make waves at Abu Dhabi Special Olympics  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN swimmer is hoping to make a big splash when she goes to the Middle East in March.Twenty three year-old Emma Carlisle will be going for gold when she swims for Ireland at the  Special Olympics World Summer Games in Abu Dhabi.Emma is one of seven athletes from Co Down included in the -strong Team Ireland squad for the Games which take place over March -.Newry is well represented with four athletes selected.

She suffered from the heart condition Tricuspid Atresia.Mrs Trainor has described the decision to send babies to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool after the provincersquos paediatric pathologist retired as ldquoinhumane.She believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.In addition, Mrs Trainor believes the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.Addressing last weekrsquos meeting, Mrs Trainor described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service, knowing that a senior pathologist was retiring.ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le, she said.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.ldquoI am not sure what provision would be in place for parents to accompany the child, but to send them on such a journey is heartbreaking.

Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

INPT-.Brooklyn is just seven years old but has thrown his little heart and soul into helping his eight-year-old buddyElisei.Little Brooklyn appears to have a knack for signing and helps his mate in an unobtrusive and unassuming manner.It’s been a long and sometimes challenging road since little Elisei first joined the nursery school at Hart Memorial, shy and unable to communicate. Due to a genetic condition, little Elisei is profoundly deaf.His Special Education Needs assistant Tracey Black went beyond the call of duty and, in her own time, learned sign language to help communicate with the little boy. Hart Memorial Primary School pupil, Elisei Cionca performs a Romanian dancewatched by classroom assistant,Tracey Black and his friend, Brooklyn Bruce. INPR-.Hart Memorial Principal Julie Shipley said: “Tracey sourced, when Elisei first came into nursery, a course to get to Stage One BSL. She did that of her own volition.“She developed that and all the way along with her education, taught others including the children in the class.Now his current teacherZoe Annett is also able to sign and Elisei has become totally involved in all class activities. And Elisei’s Romanian parents have learned sign language along with their son.Tracey Black, classroom assistant, and Elisei Cionca. INPT-.Elisei has other adult members of the family who are deaf and others who are hearing.“The way they had been communicating prior to this was ‘made-up’ gestures,” said Julie Shipley.“Now when we get one of the deaf members of the family for a parents meeting, we can get a Sign Language interpreter whereas before what we were doing was getting a Romanian interpreter who was hearing and using these made up gestures which weren’t any sign language, let along Romanian sign language.”Minister Ken Elliott who was ‘second only to Paisley as an evangelist’ dies Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"She explained the teachers Elisei has had over the years have been tremendously supportive. Elisei Cionca, right, and his friend, Brooklyn Bruce. INPT-.“Now the children in the class know way more than the teachers,” she said.Brooklyn has been in the same class as Elisei since nursery. The two boys have always been good friends.Brooklyn seems to have a special talent for picking up sign language and has used this to support Elisei throughout school, in and out of the classroom. Mrs Black, Elisei’s SEN assistant, says that she never has to worry about Elisei when she’s not there as she knows Brooklyn will keep him right!Ms Shipley said: “Elisei loves to organise people! “If he sees one of his classmates misbehaving, he’s over to them, signing away and wagging a finger, to tell them what they should be doing. Sign Of The Times...Elisei Cionca, left, and his friend, Brooklyn Bruce.

I really enjoy it and it allows me to work from home.”Courses cost from £ and include tea coffee and scones. Mary-Anne delivers savoury cookery classes as well but explained that baking is far and away the most popular.“I wasn’t actually trained as a pastry chef but there has been such a resurgence in the popularity of baking. That is where the demand is. I would love to do more cookery classes where people can learn to do savoury foods too, however the majority of bookings are for those sweet treats we all love.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Air-1.jpg","title":"eight part belfast made airbus passenger jets delivered","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Eight part-Belfast made Bombardier Airbus passenger jets were delivered at the end of last year – bringing the total number to  during .

I love the mutual ethos, and that we are fundamentally there to help the community,” she told Ulster Business.“We have to make a , but fundamentally we are there for the good of society. I passionately believe that home ownership is a good thing. And I passionately believe that savings are a good thing, and that’s what our business has been doing for more than  years.”According to its latest full-year figures, ending in December , Progressive posted pre-tax profit of £.m.In the last year, it helped more than , people buy their home and almost  to build a new home, with overall new mortgage lending of around £m.It’s weathered some of the most dficult years in the residential property market here, with Northern Ireland prices plummeting in the wake of the recession in .“We are battling our way through that – the housing market hasn’t fully recovered through it. The number of new developments probably aren’t servicing the needs of the demand. We still have an issue out there.“Slow, and modest growth is happening at the minute. But that’s good, and that’s sustainable. Affordability is very good in Northern Ireland and the economic factors, even with Brexit, are good.”Progressive now has  branches and more than  staff spread throughout Northern Ireland.For Darina, it’s about working hand-in-hand with the customer, and ensuring everyone in the team in the same mindset.“For me, it has to be doing right by the customer. Once your staff are fully on that journey too, they know they are doing the right thing,” Darina says. “They aren’t forced into sales targets – they want to get the right product fro the person, and making it as easy as they possibly can.“In part, to hand hold. There are some cases where deadlines don’t happen, things don’t go according to plans – for example, in a housing chain, someone can drop out. It’s about being there, and being able to help.“There is still a demand for people to buy houses – that hasn’t changed at all.”Darina took over at the helm in , while the property market in Northern Ireland, and throughout the UK, was still going through tough times. But she believes it has normalised since then.“Things are picking up,” she says. “We have the experience here to keep going in a direction that suits the demographic that we serve.“We are here for the long-term, and factor that in. Ultimately, it has to be right for the consumer.“It’s also about the whole of Northern Ireland. It’s not just Belfast-centric, and we have to extend our reach. There’s good activity in dferent parts of Northern Ireland, and that’s where our roots are.”And after more than  years with the organisation, Darina says she has no plans to jump ship to another financial business.“I am totally bought in to the mutual ethos. For me, it’s all about the customer. I would struggle where decisions would be made for shareholder , or short-termism.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
