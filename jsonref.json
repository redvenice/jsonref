This will be put in law. The police can take action against you if you leave home without a \u0027reasonable excuse\u0027, and issue you with a fine (Fixed Penalty Notice).You can be given a Fixed Penalty Notice of £200 for the first offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of £6,400.A \u0027reasonable excuse\u0027 includes:Work - you can only leave home for work purposes where it is unreasonable for you to do your job from home, including but not limited to people who work within critical national infrastructure, construction or manufacturing that require in-person attendanceVolunteering - you can also leave home to provide voluntary or charitable services.Essential activities - you can leave home to buy things at shops or obtain services. You may also leave your home to do these things on behalf of a disabled or vulnerable person or someone self-isolating.Education and childcare - You can only leave home for education, registered childcare, and supervised activities for children where they are eligible to attend. Access to education and children\u0027s activities for school-aged pupils is restricted. See further information on education and childcare. People can continue existing arrangements for contact between parents and children where they live apart. This includes childcare bubbles.Meeting others and care - You can leave home to visit people in your support bubble ( if you are legally permitted to form one), to provide informal childcare for children under 14 as part of a childcare bubble (for example, to enable parents to work, and not to enable social contact between adults), to provide care for disabled or vulnerable people, to provide emergency assistance, to attend a support group (of up to 15 people), or for respite care where that care is being provided to a vulnerable person or a person with a disability, or is a short break in respect of a looked-after child.Exercise - You can continue to exercise alone, with one other person or with your household or support bubble. This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area.You should maintain social distancing. See exercising and meeting other people.Medical reasons - You can leave home for a medical reason, including to get a COVID-19 test, for medical appointments and emergencies.Harm and compassionate visits - you can leave home to be with someone who is giving birth, to avoid injury or illness or to escape risk of harm (such as domestic abuse).

You should follow the guidance on the safe use of places of worship and must not mingle with anyone outside of your household or support bubble when attending a place of worship.Weddings, funerals and religious, belief-based or commemorative events linked to someone\u0027s death are all subject to limits on the numbers that can attend, and weddings and civil ceremonies may only take place in exceptional circumstances.There are further reasonable excuses. For example, you may leave home to fulfil legal obligations or to carry out activities related to buying, selling, letting or renting a residential property, or where it is reasonably necessary for voting in an election or referendum.Exercising and meeting other peopleYou should minimise time spent outside your home.It is against the law to meet socially with family or friends unless they are part of your household or support bubble. You can only leave your home to exercise, and not for the purpose of recreation or leisure (e.g. a picnic or a social meeting). This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area.You can exercise in a public outdoor place:by yourselfwith the people you live withwith your support bubble (if you are legally permitted to form one)in a childcare bubble where providing childcareor, when on your own, with 1 person from another householdPublic outdoor places include:parks, beaches, countryside accessible to the public, forestspublic gardens (whether or not you pay to enter them)the grounds of a heritage siteplaygroundsOutdoor sports venues, including tennis courts, golf courses and swimming pools, must close.When around other people, stay 2 metres apart from anyone not in your household - meaning the people you live with - or your support bubble. Where this is not possible, stay 1 metre apart with extra precautions (e.g. wearing a face covering).You must wear a face covering in many indoor settings, such as shops or places of worship where these remain open, and on public transport, unless you are exempt. This is the law. Read guidance on face coverings.Support and childcare bubblesYou have to meet certain eligibility rules to form a support or childcare bubble. This means not everyone will be able to form a bubble.A support bubble is a support network which links two households. You can form a support bubble with another household of any size only if you meet the eligibility rules.It is against the law to form a support bubble if you do not follow these rules.You are permitted to leave your home to visit your support bubble (and to stay overnight with them). However, if you form a support bubble, it is best if this is with a household who live locally. This will help prevent the virus spreading from an area where more people are infected.If you live in a household with anyone aged under 14, you can form a childcare bubble. This allows friends or family from one other household to provide informal childcare.You must not meet socially with your childcare bubble, and must avoid seeing members of your childcare and support bubbles at the same time.There is separate guidance for support bubbles and childcare bubbles.Where and when you can meet in larger groupsThere are still circumstances in which you are allowed to meet others from outside your household, childcare or support bubble in larger groups, but this should not be for socialising and only for permitted purposes. A full list of these circumstances will be included in the regulations, and includes:for work, or providing voluntary or charitable services, where it is unreasonable to do so from home. This can include work in other people\u0027s homes where necessary - for example, for nannies, cleaners, social care workers providing support to children and families, or tradespeople. See guidance on working safely in other people\u0027s homes). Where a work meeting does not need to take place in a private home or garden, it should not - for example, although you can meet a personal trainer, you should do so in a public outdoor place.in a childcare bubble (for the purposes of childcare only)Where eligible to use these services, for education, registered childcare, and supervised activities for children. Access to education and childcare facilities is restricted.

This means, for example, a tradesperson can go into a household without breaching the limit, if they are there for work, and the officiant at a wedding would not count towards the limit.If you break the rulesThe police can take action against you if you meet in larger groups. This includes breaking up illegal gatherings and issuing fines (fixed penalty notices).You can be given a Fixed Penalty Notice of £200 for the first offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of £6,400. If you hold, or are involved in holding, an illegal gathering of over 30 people, the police can issue fines of £10,000.Protecting people more at risk from coronavirusIf you are clinically vulnerable, you could be at higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. There is additional advice for people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus. Those who are clinically extremely vulnerable should not attend work, school, college or university, and limit the time you spend outside the home. You should only go out for medical appointments, exercise or if it is essential.TravelYou must not leave your home unless you have a reasonable excuse (for example, for work or education purposes). If you need to travel you should stay local – meaning avoiding travelling outside of your village, town or the part of a city where you live – and look to reduce the number of journeys you make overall. The list of reasons you can leave your home and area include, but are not limited to:work, where you cannot reasonably work from homeaccessing education and for caring responsibilitiesvisiting those in your support bubble – or your childcare bubble for childcarevisiting hospital, GP and other medical appointments or visits where you have had an accident or are concerned about your healthbuying goods or services that you need, but this should be within your local area wherever possibleoutdoor exercise. This should be done locally wherever possible, but you can travel a short distance within your area to do so if necessary (for example, to access an open space)attending the care and exercise of an animal, or veterinary servicesIf you need to travel, walk or cycle where possible, and plan ahead and avoid busy times and routes on public transport. This will allow you to practice social distancing while you travel.Avoid car sharing with anyone from outside your household or your support bubble. See the guidance on car sharing.If you need to use public transport, you should follow the safer travel guidance.International travelYou can only travel internationally – or within the UK – where you first have a legally permitted reason to leave home. In addition, you should consider the public health advice in the country you are visiting.If you do need to travel overseas (and are legally permitted to do so, for example, because it is for work), even if you are returning to a place you\u0027ve visited before, you should look at the rules in place at your destination and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) travel advice.UK residents currently abroad do not need to return home immediately. However, you should check with your airline or travel operator on arrangements for returning.Foreign nationals are subject to the \u0027Stay at Home\u0027 regulations. You should not travel abroad unless it is permitted. This means you must not go on holiday.If you are visiting the UK, you may return home. You should check whether there are any restrictions in place at your destination.Staying away from home overnightYou cannot leave your home or the place where you are living for holidays or overnight stays unless you have a reasonable excuse for doing so. This means that holidays in the UK and abroad are not allowed.This includes staying in a second home or caravan, if that is not your primary residence. This also includes staying with anyone who you don\u0027t live with unless they\u0027re in your support bubble.You are allowed to stay overnight away from your home if you:are visiting your support bubbleare unable to return to your main residenceneed accommodation while moving houseneed accommodation to attend a funeral or related commemorative eventrequire accommodation for work purposes or to provide voluntary servicesare a child requiring accommodation for school or careare homeless, seeking asylum, a vulnerable person seeking refuge, or if escaping harm (including domestic abuse)are an elite athlete or their support staff or parent, if the athlete is under 18 and it is necessary to be outside of the home for training or competitionIf you are already on holiday, you should return to your home as soon as practical.Guest accommodation providers such as hotels, B\u0026ampBs and caravan parks may remain open for the specific reasons set out in law, including where guests are unable to return to their main residence, use that guest accommodation as their main residence, need accommodation while moving house, are self-isolating as required by law, or would otherwise be made homeless as a result of the accommodation closing.

This is essential to keeping the country operating and supporting sectors and employers.Public sector employees working in essential services, including childcare or education, should continue to go into work.Where it is necessary for you to work in other people\u0027s homes - for example, for nannies, cleaners or tradespeople - you can do so. Otherwise, you should avoid meeting for work in a private home or garden, where COVID-19 Secure measures may not be in place.Employers and employees should discuss their working arrangements, and employers should take every possible step to facilitate their employees working from home, including providing suitable IT and equipment to enable remote working.The risk of transmission can be substantially reduced if COVID-19 secure guidelines are followed closely. Extra consideration should be given to those people at higher risk.Going to school, college and universityColleges, primary (reception onwards) and secondary schools will remain open for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers. All other children will learn remotely until February half term.In the circumstances, we do not think it is possible for all exams in the summer to go ahead as planned. We will accordingly be working with Ofqual to consult rapidly to put in place alternative arrangements that will allow students to progress fairly.Public exams and vocational assessments scheduled to take place in January will go ahead as planned.UniversitiesThose students who are undertaking training and study for the following courses should return to face to face learning as planned and be tested twice, upon arrival or self-isolate for ten days:Medicine \u0026amp dentistrySubjects allied to medicinehealthVeterinary scienceEducation (initial teacher training)Social workCourses which require Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Body (PSRB) assessments and or mandatory activity which is scheduled for January and which cannot be rescheduled (your university will notify you if this applies to you).Students who do not study these courses should remain where they are wherever possible, and start their term online, as facilitated by their university until at least Mid-February. This includes students on other practical courses not on the list above.We have previously published guidance to universities and students on how students can return safely to higher education in the spring term. This guidance sets out how we will support higher education providers to enable students that need to return to do so as safely as possible following the winter break.If you live at university, you should not move back and forward between your permanent home and student home during term time.For those students who are eligible for face to face teaching, you can meet in groups of more than your household as part of your formal education or training, where necessary. Students should expect to follow the guidance and restrictions. You should socially distance from anyone you do not live with wherever possible.ChildcareThere are several ways that parents and carers can continue to access childcare:Early Years settings (including nurseries and childminders) remain openVulnerable children and children of critical workers can continue to use registered childcare, childminders and other childcare activities (including wraparound care)parents are able to form a childcare bubble with one other household for the purposes of informal childcare, where the child is under 14.

Nurseries can stay open.Under the the new guidance, published overnight, non-essential retail, all hospitality, gyms and swimming pools will be ordered to close across the country. Cafes, bars and restaurants will be allowed to serve takeaway - but in a tightening from the draconian measures last spring, they will not be allowed to serve any alcohol.Vulnerable people are being told to shield where possible.

The Merchant of Venice famously features the Jewish moneylender Shylock, who demands a pound of flesh from the merchant Antonio if a loan is not repaid by his deadline.Morpurgo was quoted as saying: “The play can be antisemitic … I did feel this was Shakespeare’s play and I could not tell it honestly. It would be offensive.”But speaking to the  on Monday, the author of War Horse and Kensuke’s Kingdom rejected the framing of the decision and denied that he shied away from difficult subject matter for children.“The notion that I censored this, it is such nonsense. I chose the 10 plays I love the most, that I felt young children would respond to,” he said. “To be honest with you, The Merchant of Venice is not a play I enjoy myself. I didn’t ‘refuse’ to include the play, no one told me to do it – I sat down quietly and decided the 10 I would do. It’s completely wrong and a kneejerk reaction.”Morpurgo said the book, which will be published next year and was only intended to include 10 of Shakespeare’s plays, was focused on plays that had “very strong storylines, and plays that children would be most likely to see at the theatre or study at school”. Starting on 8 January, performances of his retellings by the Royal Shakespeare Company will be made available to schools around the UK for free for five weeks.“There are certain plays, and The Merchant of Venice is one of them, that I believed would not resonate with eight-year-olds. Yes, there was some worry that this might be the first time an eight-year-old reads about a Jew. A story that the Nazis used to portray Jewish people in a bad light – that is not something you put in front of an eight-year-old as their first example of an extraordinary group that has contributed so much to the world and suffered so much,” he said. “Now, that is not to say the play does not have merit. But this is not censorship, children will come to this play later, when they’ll have some sense of what Jewish people have endured over centuries.”“The point of this project is to bring Shakespeare to the eyes, ears and hearts of children in our time,” said Morpurgo, who grew up reading Charles and Mary Lamb’s retellings, also titled Tales from Shakespeare, which was published in 1807. “You have a writer and the RSC trying to encourage children to go to the theatre - I fail to see how that is offensive or censorship.”The Sunday Times quoted Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, describing Morpurgo’s decision as an example of “the dead hand of political correctness. It is cowardly not to face up to great literature. Of course there is going to be plenty to be offended by in Shakespeare … children do not want to be protected all the time against great literature.”“If I had suggested doing Titus Andronicus for primary school children, an eyebrow or two might have been raised. It doesn’t even do for me, and I am 77. It is almost as if anything you do around Shakespeare is treated like holy writ and that is the problem. He was a man of the people and his plays weren’t just for the classroom,” Morpurgo said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5716d4117743a11d3710089af2f127213dc541e6/0_36_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c953852ac85b54db63ce2f3dd0d9b349","title":"next christmas profits better than expected buoyed by online sales","story":"Chief executive warns that gains will be almost entirely offset by latest Covid restrictionsNext has emerged as a winner from a tough Christmas period as sales transferred from shuttered stores to its website, but the fashion chain warned new lockdown measures would wipe out the extra profit it had made.The retailer’s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, said the £28m of additional profit it had made from better than expected sales in November and December would be almost entirely cancelled out by the impact of shutdowns during the important Boxing Day sales period as well as new restrictions in England and Scotland which complete the closure of the 500 store chain.The new lockdown had seemed “inevitable”, said Wolfson, adding that while it was easy for people to feel angry with the government, the real culprit was the virus. “What I will be very disappointed by is if we don’t pull every lever to roll out the vaccine as quickly as possible,” he said.Next said the pandemic was also delaying stock deliveries from Asia as there was a shortage of freight containers. “It is not getting it into the country that’s the problem it’s getting it into a container at the other end,” Wolfson said.“I don’t think if you went on to our site you would go, ‘My gosh there’s nothing here’,” said Wolfson. “On some of the best-selling lines we are thinking ‘We wish we had more of that’ but it’s on the water and should be with us in three weeks time. The stock problem and the store closure problem to a degree mitigate each other.”The company said the closure of about half its shops had limited its ability to clear discounted stock after Christmas. It would be able to clear about a quarter of it through its website however, it would cost the company £5m more than selling it in its shops. The remainder will be sold in its outlet stores.At the start of the Covid crisis, Next had predicted the pandemic would have a disastrous impact on its finances, but sales have held up better than it anticipated, boosted by demand for new home furnishings, loungewear and children’s clothing.Wolfson also confirmed Next was part of a consortium bidding for some of the fashion brands owned by Sir Philip Green’s stricken Arcadia group but it would not take a majority stake in any deal. The Topshop and Topman owner went into administration in November putting 13,000 jobs at risk.“We are only interested in the brands that we think are very, very good,” said Wolfson. He suggested if the consortium won it would result in a similar set-up to the one struck for lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret, where Next operates the stores and website on its behalf.Next has proved itself to be one of the industry’s most resilient retailers. Its shares have recovered strongly from the collapse seen last year when the UK first went into lockdown.Years of investment in its home shopping business had enabled Next to weather the storm, said Richard Lim, chief executive of analysts Retail Economics. “These results are likely to set the tone for a polarised view of the retail sector which separates those with impressive online capabilities with those that do not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71436ad7f40be56a5bc8a103923d58901bb9316d/0_509_3596_2159/master/3596.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73964974ca9d2bc82af4801b5847af13","title":"record month for uk supermarkets as covid brings dinner back home","story":"Sales of take-home groceries soar with pubs and restaurants forced to close in key trading periodDecember was the biggest month on record for British supermarkets as shoppers spent nearly £12bn stocking up on cheese, fresh fish and pork for a very unusual Christmas.Consumers spent £11.7bn on take-home groceries in the four weeks to 27 December, up from the previous record of just under £11bn in November, according to analysts at Kantar, as many pubs and restaurants were forced to close during the key trading period.Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail at Kantar, said: “December is always an incredibly busy time for supermarkets, but take-home grocery shopping is usually supplemented by celebrations in restaurants, pubs and bars – with £4bn spent on food and drink, excluding alcohol, out of the home during the normal festive month. This year, almost all those meals were eaten at home and retailers stepped up monumentally to meet the surge in demand.”McKevitt said: “Without guests to host, it seems many families decided to pare things back slightly and the performance of traditional dinner items reflects this.”Monday 21 December was the busiest shopping day – earlier than the expected surge on 23 December – as households secured festive supplies amid the uncertainties of tiered lockdowns and problems at the Channel ports which disrupted deliveries of fruit and vegetables.However, Morrisons was the only one of the big four supermarkets to gain market share as local independent stores, discounters Lidl and Iceland and online specialist Ocado all outperformed the major chains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f1a4554b0e2dd67e2697a4758b3404785958b23/0_141_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5c66cf058f09f0b837ac52e6f5d7ab48","title":"market rally ends as england scotland plunged fresh lockdown covid coronavirus stocks pound sterling business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news as England and Scotland enter tough Covid restrictionsLloyd’s of London, the world’s biggest and oldest insurance market, has closed its underwriting room for the second time in its history. As of today, all insurance brokers, agents and underwriters will be working from home again, after England introduced a third national lockdown. The whole Richard Rogers-designed building in the City has effectively closed, and Lloyd’s said the underwriting room was unlikely to reopen before mid-February. The insurance market shut its underwriting room for almost six months on 19 March, but kept it open one day a week during the second English lockdown in November. Since then, hundreds of people had been doing business face-to-face on the underwriting floor most days, compared with thousands before the pandemic, which dwindled to even smaller numbers over the Christmas and New Year period.Berenberg’s senior economist Kallum Pickering adds that the UK government may have to extend some programmes like government-backed loans and furlough to ensure the private sector survives lockdown. Fiscal policy tools such as the various coronavirus business loan schemes as the well as the furlough scheme (due to end 30 April) may need to be extended once again to further support private sector cash-flow and jobs. However, he doesn’t think the Bank of England is likely to go to extreme measures like cutting rates below zero, to support the recovery. While markets may begin to price in a higher chance that the BoE will soon cut the bank rate below zero, it remains unlikely, in our view. To support confidence, the BoE may announce an increase in the pace of ongoing asset purchases – it has plenty of scope to achieve this within its current plan to buy £150bn of gilts until the end of 2021.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg, says the bank has slashed growth UK forecasts for Q1 in light of fresh lockdowns in England and Scotland. Following the new lockdown, the near-term outlook now looks much worse than before.Despite the near-term hit, the UK medium-term outlook remains positive. With much less Brexit uncertainty and strong gains in global demand ahead, UK real GDP can still recover to its pre-pandemic level by the end of 2022 as previously expected. Here’s our full story on the Chancellor’s business lockdown support package: The FTSE 250 is one of the last bright spots across European equity markets. Meanwhile, US futures are pointing to a flat open: Office landlords, beware. New lockdown measures in England and Scotland have pushed a return to the office even further into the future for UK workers. But this will also have an impact on the rental value of London offices, according to new research from Morgan Stanley. It puts this slide down to the more enthusiastic adoption of working from home by UK office workers compared with their counterparts in continental Europe, and UK employers’ willingness to allow more working from home in the future, all of which are negative for landlords.Pubs and breweries in England are giving a rather lukewarm reaction to Chancellor’s Rishi Sunak’s offer of one-off grants to help English pubs get through lockdown 3.0.Pubs will be eligible for grants of between £4,000- £9,000 depending on their rateable value, which comparable to the rent that premises could charge on the open market.Chris Jowsey, CEO of Admiral Taverns, said the 1,000 publicans who lease their pubs from him, most of whom are only eligible for the lowest grant, needed £3,000 a month of support just to stay afloat. The new one-off grants, together with those already available, mean the majority will be getting around £2,300. “It’s welcome but it’s just not enough,” he said.The British Beer \u0026amp Pubs Association hailed a £277m “lifeline” for English pubs that it said would keep them afloat until the spring, preventing a flood of potential closures.But it warned that the industry’s long-term survival would require a cut to beer duty and continued business rates relief.Some pubs lost out on tens of thousands of pounds of sales due to Christmas lockdowns and Christian Mole, head of UK hospitality and leisure at accountancy EY, wonders why this has not been recognised.It is surprising that there does not appear to be some differentiation in grant levels between those businesses in areas which were able to open through to Christmas and those which were not.Meanwhile, SIBA - the trade body that represents the UK’s army of craft brewers, is fuming that pubs won’t be allowed to offer alcohol with takeaways, cutting off a major route to market. Chief executive James Calder said: Sales through takeaway, click and collect and drive through have enabled many to just about survive up to now.This reversal in policy directly discriminates against small businesses while allowing supermarkets to continue to sell beer from global breweries.Despite calls for further business support (and quick), the chancellor Rishi Sunak has reportedly said that the budget in March will be an excellent opportunity to take stock and set out the next stage of support, according to Reuters. The budget is set for 3 March.British Chamber of Commerce boss Adam Marshall has criticised the government for failing to announce Covid restrictions and business support measures at the same time last night. Speaking to Sky News this morning, he said: This is a pattern that we have seen repeatedly whereby businesses find that their operations are going to be somehow further curtailed without having knowledge of the support that’s going to be there to help them through that period of restriction and difficulty.It should be possible, I think, to announce both restrictions and support in tandem, because that in turn generates business confidence and means that phones aren’t ringing off the hook with worried businesses wondering whether they’ll be able to open and be whether they’ll be able to pay their people and their suppliers at the end of the month.TUI and Thomas Cook are among the airlines cancelling their UK flights amid fresh Covid lockdowns, according to the BBC Scotland’s business editor:There are still looming deadlines marking the end of government-backed loans, business rates and VAT relief, that may not be offset by the grants programme. It raises questions over whether further support could be announced before the March budget. ITV business editor Joel Hills has helpfully laid out the bulk of government support offered to date to businesses hit by Covid:British Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall says the latest batch of support is effectively short-term plaster, and longer-term solutions are needed if businesses are to survive the next year. Speaking to Sky News on Ian King Live this morning, Marshall said: Our rationale is that many businesses are going to face a difficult and uncertain time throughout this year, even if we are lucky enough to see vaccine rollouts happening quickly over the coming months. It’s going to take businesses time to reestablish demands to re establish cash flow and so much more besides support needs to be consistent and available for a long enough period of time, to help save many of those good businesses and let them get back on their feet.I don’t see many businesses are able to invest in these circumstances and when you look at the support measures that are available, many of them still have a cliff edge at the end of March, or at the end of April, they are very short term in nature. And however welcome they might be for those businesses who are struggling to pay their bills over a period of weeks or indeed a month or two, they don’t let many companies plan.British Airways owner IAG has said it’s reviewing its flight schedule following the UK’s national lockdown, according to Reuters.

Here are the measures that must be takenIt’s easy to feel frustrated by the government’s response to this pandemic, and wonder why it hasn’t acted sooner. Ministers wasted an opportunity to suppress the virus in the summer when cases were low, and instead chose to open up quickly and recklessly after the first national lockdown. The government subsidised people to eat out in restaurants and bars, and encouraged holidays abroad via “travel corridors” without any kind of testing or quarantine restrictions for when travellers returned. It was always likely that, if uncontrolled, the virus that causes Covid-19 would mutate. High prevalence created more opportunities for a variant to emerge that now appears to be spreading at a worrying pace.Where does this leave the UK? Among scientists, optimism about several approved vaccines is tempered by serious concerns about the new variant, and what the next weeks have in store. Sage experts note that even with restrictions in place, it will be a challenge to stop the spread of this new variant over the next few weeks. The substantial rate of serious illness associated with Covid-19 also underlines the risks of exposing a large percentage of the population to a virus that is still not fully understood. Even a plan to allow the virus to run through the population would require restrictions, because the high rate of hospitalisation that results from Covid infections is dangerous to everyone. If hospitals are full, patients of all stripes – whether they’re suffering from a heart attack or a road traffic injury – can’t get the necessary treatment. And without spare beds, Covid-19 patients can’t get access to the ICU care they need to stay alive.The opposite response to this is what has been called a maximum suppression or “zero Covid” model. But at this stage, with the Office for National Statistics estimating that England is around 100,000 infections a day, and the new variant putting pressure on the NHS and the test-and-trace system, pursuing this strategy no longer seems feasible. The immediate priority should be surviving the next few months without the NHS collapsing, and planning for a robust response to eliminate Covid in the spring and summer.Vaccinating as many people as quickly as possible will be key to this. The UK has decided to vaccinate more people with one dose rather than fewer people with two. This is an ethical and political judgment rather than a scientific one waiting for follow-up doses to be delivered carries huge costs.But vaccinating everyone will take time, which is why a national lockdown was necessary. Schools will be closed until mid-February, except for the most vulnerable children and those of essential workers. This will reduce community transmission and allow scientists to gather new evidence about the variant.As always, mass testing and supported isolation are central to controlling the virus. Both during the lockdown and after these new restrictions are lifted, we should be testing people rapidly to identify those who are carriers, and ensuring those who must isolate have the resources – both financial and practical – to spend 10 days alone. That isolation is an act of goodwill is something the government has repeatedly overlooked during this pandemic, and those who are isolating need to be compensated for doing so.The government has spent many months and billions of pounds on its testing-and-tracing strategy. So it’s surprising that, despite these efforts, its approach to visitors arriving from overseas is still so lax. Preventing the import of Covid-19 cases and variants requires robust testing and quarantine procedures at our borders. Yet people are allowed in to the UK without a negative Covid test result, and pictures of crowding at airports – in contrast to the carefully planned approach of countries such as South Korea – do little to instil confidence in the safety of this approach.Finally, and most importantly, we need to follow these new restrictions, continue to distance from each and avoid crowded spaces and public transport, wear face coverings, and do our best to avoid getting infected and passing the virus on. We must deprive it of any opportunities to survive and infect others. In the spring, longer days and mass vaccinations will give us another chance to eliminate Covid and prepare for the coming winter. The UK’s health and economy depends upon it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/094624fa79569cf55461c1bbb9f8a5c4f3c7f2d2/0_194_8192_4914/master/8192.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e66cc98f811eed03a9e1ca6c62e54f79","title":"why the worlds biggest mammal migration is crucial for africa photo essay aoe","story":"Up to 10 million straw-coloured fruit bats descend on Zambia’s Kasanka national park every year, dispersing millions of seeds as they goDavid Mubiana will always remember the day he was shot. It happened in 2002, when his unit was ambushed by poachers with AK-47 rifles and a shotgun. He was wounded in the arm and stomach one bullet rupturing his spleen. As a wildlife police officer in Zambia’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife, his job is inherently risky.Like other wildlife protectors, he puts his life on the line every day. But not every animal needing protection is a big beast. Following the incident in 2002 in a park bordering Angola, Mubiana was transferred to Kasanka national park in central Zambia, where he now protects one of nature’s mysteries – and the biggest mammal migration in the world – from poachers and land encroachment. These poachers may be after antelope and elephants, but their actions also pose a threat to the straw-coloured fruit bat, Eidolon helvum.Every year, between October and December, 8–10 million straw-coloured fruit bats descend on the park to feast on an abundance of fruit. From west Africa, over the forests of the Congo basin and on to Zambia, the bats migrate thousands of kilometres over savanna and open land, dispersing seeds into deforested areas, and reforesting and regenerating landscapes on their journey. Scientists are still trying to fathom why these fruit bats, or “flying foxes”, gather at Kasanka in numbers not seen anywhere else. Each night they leave their evergreen swamp fig roosts to fly up to 55 miles (90km) in search of wild berries and fruit.Listed as near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list, the straw-coloured fruit bat is one of the largest fruit bats in Africa. There are fears that if their numbers drop below a certain amount, the colony may not be able to keep going. “If that turns out to be true, we might be in trouble,” says Dr Dina Dechmann of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, whose team has studied the bats for 12 years.With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the bats have faced a new threat from humans seeking to attack them. “These bats are being persecuted because of ongoing publicity about their role as virus hosts. Their importance completely outweighs the potential threat,” says Dechmann, adding that their role in transmitting viruses such as Covid-19 directly to humans has not been scientifically proved.But habitat loss is fast becoming the park’s chief threat. As forests where bats roost and feed are lost, they are increasingly being forced out. “Bats will either need to forage farther, or they will remain in the same location and overuse resources. So it’s a habitat and wildlife management issue just as much as an urban-human bat conflict issue,” says Taylor-Boyd.Areas surrounding the park are also critical for people who rely on the forest for food and income. The trust has helped communities gain legal ownership of 60,000 hectares of surrounding forest, supporting income-generating activities such as beekeeping. Churchill Musungwa, a voluntary forest guard, says his community decided to work with the trust after seeing land nearby destroyed.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/287fab06772aebc09574debd0c93c6a2d747606d/156_39_780_468/master/780.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n\u0026s=d94cf9046b5e1f6154420235e9d0e08e","title":"nigel slaters recipe for cabbage taleggio and pancetta","story":"Give a twist to this ubiquitous winter vegetable by baking slices, then adorn with melting cheeseMake a dressing by using 50ml of olive oil, a small handful of parsley leaves and 10g of grated fresh horseradish.Beat in 2 tbsp of water and then set the dressing aside.Cut 4 horizontal slices (2cm thick) from a small, tight cabbage, then carefully place the slices flat on a baking tray.Trickle the cabbage slices generously with olive oil and scatter over 150g of diced pancetta.Bake the cabbage slices in a preheated oven at 200Cgas mark 6 for 15 minutes until it has softened.Cut 200g of taleggio into thin slices and place it on top of the cabbage.

Ninety minutes before the kick-off, I’m outside St Mary’s Stadium in Southampton. Around me is the occasional patrolling steward and a few TV technicians carrying kit into the ground. The silence is interrupted only by the cracks of fireworks from across the city.Suddenly a loud bellow from just beyond the waist-high perimeter fencing shocks me. “Come on you Reds,” a cyclist shouts as he pedals by. He looks at me and shrugs: “Well someone has to say it, haven’t they?” On he goes, repeating his chant as he disappears into the darkness. By the end of the evening, Southampton will be top of the Premier League for the first time in their history.In June, when Project Restart was in its infancy, football behind closed doors seemed like a quirky interruption. We were all just so glad to have it back in any form. How we smiled to see crossbars being sprayed with disinfectant and away teams emerging from unusual corners of the stadium, perhaps having changed in a version of the groundsman’s hut.Those motivational tarpaulins masking empty seats, resplendent with club mottos, were colourful and cheery. It was summertime, there were five substitutes allowed and drinks breaks. Now that all seems a long time ago and it feels very different.With winter here, darkness has enveloped the grounds the floodlights are on, bathing not only the pitches but also the surrounding communities in a milky glow. From outside it is now even more obvious that a game is going on, a clear beacon to fans that a party is happening and they don’t have an invitation. It is seven months since football returned. Through all this I have been a lucky one: a photographer – one of the few to be let in.I’m in Liverpool on the opening day of the season and I have time to spare before a tantalising match between the champions and promoted Leeds. On the gable end of a house in a typical Anfield street is a newly painted mural of Jordan Henderson lifting the Premier League trophy.As I photograph it, a woman takes out her phone and does the same. I cannot help but feel guilty, I’m off to see this fascinating match and she almost certainly is not. I think of her again after the match and feel even worse. A breathtaking game has ended 4-3, the sort of game that lifts your heart and confirms why you love football, why you go through the turnstiles to watch it.A couple of days later I am on the other side of the Pennines for Sheffield United v Wolves. The talk on the radio is of a possible return of fans. There is a sense of positivity that we will be out of this before long now. Wolves score two early goals and I imagine the vitriol that would have poured down from the vast Kop stand behind me.Filling out health clearance forms and temperature checks are now part of my routine, like packing my camera bags. At Chelsea in early October, having lugged my gear to the front entrance, I am hot and sweating. The temperature steward aims the little white gun at my forehead. “That’s 32.2,” he says. “Surely I’d be having organ failure if that was true,” I reply. The steward duly waves me through.I have done quite a few games at Chelsea in recent months and have talked with a friendly steward who hands out our sanitised photographer bibs. She tells me how fearful she is for some of the regulars in the West stand, especially for their mental health. She recalls how coming to the ground, seeing everyone there, being part of that community, has been like having a second family, helping her through some difficult personal times.Just before a match starts, I have often found myself walking the empty concourses behind the stands. Before, these places would be vibrant and buzzing with anticipation places where friends would meet up, drink and laugh, around them walls painted in club colours. Now they are like haunted houses.Evidence of what used to be keeps popping up – the bookies odds for first goalscorer still scrawled up on whiteboards, adverts promoting events in March. I can’t stop staring at the ones imploring people to go to the now notorious Cheltenham Festival in 2020.At Selhurst Park, I have been able to go to the back of the Arthur Wait stand and retrace the steps I used to take as a kid. Back then it was always down the same set of steep stairs from the same turnstiles on Park Road to the concourse at the back of the stand then out to the terraces or seats. The memories flood back.Come Halloween, I’m in a rain-lashed Sheffield to see United take on Manchester City. My allotted parking place is by a wall where names of fans are chiselled into each brick. On the other side of this wall, a dozen sodden fans are peering over, trying to get a tiny glimpse of the players getting off their buses.Before the game I chat to a steward in the massive Kop stand. “It’s bonkers,” he says. “They’ll be ramming into pubs right now and as long as they have a pie with their pint, they can watch this match on a big screenWhy can’t some sit and watch it in here?”On the drive home, I hear on the radio the prime minister announce another national lockdown. The prospect of fans being back in grounds such as Bramall Lane seems a distant hope.It’s definitely the sound that I find most surreal when no fans are in the grounds. The further you go up the football food chain, the larger the stadiums and the worse it gets. An empty Wembley is the ultimate echo chamber.The thwack of boot on ball reverberates up and around the bowl before slowly fading awayWhen the players from Manchester City and Everton line up before the Women’s FA Cup final to hear an immaculately dressed singer belt out Abide with Me, the anthem performed at just about every Cup final since 1927, it is eerie. I’m so used to this moment being associated with mass participation of a huge crowd. The hymn’s meaning seems even more moving right now, given the pandemic. The emptiness of the stands feels almost crushing.During the past few months, the fans I have felt most sorry for are probably those of Brentford and AFC Wimbledon. Both clubs have moved into new stadiums, usually a time for celebration, but this has not happened. Only at the beginning of December did a few Brentford fans get the chance to sample their new home.It was in early September that I attended the first competitive match there. The perfect grass, cutting-edge architecture, multicoloured empty seats – it felt like I was watching a video game. I was also at the new Plough Lane for the “grand” opening of the ground, 29 years after they played their last game nearby as Wimbledon FC.The only presence of the Wimbledon fans who resurrected the club in 2002 is themselves as cardboard cutouts. It was a bittersweet night. My friend and colleague Daffydd, a lifelong Dons fan, has been suffering awfully with motor neurone disease. The next day I email Daff to tell him how great the stadium is and that the managing director has promised to get him there as soon as possible. He doesn’t reply. Five days later Daff passes away.In late November, I’m at Fulham v Everton. A new stand is being built on the river side of the ground . At the end of the match, a workman emerges from the building site, speaking Portuguese. He persuades Richarlison, Everton’s Brazilian forward, to give him his shirt. Richarlison, seeming only too happy to be speaking to a real fan, climbs up and throws him the memento.In Canvey Island, Essex, Steve Marks is up a ladder erected on the flat garage roof next to his bungalow. A huge Union Jack is stiff to the breeze on a flagpole behind him as a freezing cold squall blows through. Fully decked out in waterproofs, he looks like the captain of a ship steering through a storm. About 50 yards away his team are playing their biggest match ever, a second-round FA Cup tie against Boreham Wood, which is live on BT Sport. “I couldn’t miss this,” he says, twirling his old-fashioned rattle, the sort that only seems to come out for cup ties. Other fans are on ladders, banging on a blue corrugated iron fence that rings the ground. “Two days later and we’d be in there,” one says, referring to the end of lockdown . “Typical, the biggest day in our club history and look at us.”With about five minutes to go, Boreham Wood’s burly centre-forward, Matt Rhead, nods in the third goal. Throughout the match he bore the brunt of the chants from the Canvey Ultras. He laps it up, playing the pantomime villain to perfection, joined by his teammates. Boy, how I’ve missed this – the moment when a goal is scored, when scorers and fans unite. It’s the whole reason and point of the game.When fans are not present, you can hear the net ripple and the scorers don’t know what to do with themselves. It usually ends up in a tame high-five or a polite handshake as if we are back in the 1950s. At least with a few spectators to see them, the players have got a reason to unfurl their best routines and a goal is celebrated properly.The lockdown is lifted on 2 December and clubs in tier 2 areas are allowed to host 2,000 spectators at matches. This means a whole new world for the fan, one of arrows, one-way systems and advice everywhere. At West Ham, the huge screen on the side of the London Stadium scrolls through slides saying ‘welcome home’ and then urges ‘hands, face, space’.At Brighton, Southampton are the first visitors to play in front of fans. James Ward-Prowse is about to take a corner in front of the baying Seagulls supporters in the North stand. The hulking figure of Jannik Vestergaard, the Southampton centre-back, slowly walked into the penalty box. “Oi, Vestergaard, you mutant,” one wag shouts. The rest of the fans laugh. Everyone, including all of the players, hears it. The ball is crossed in and flies off the centre-back’s forehead into the net. Cue exuberant celebration.As Old Trafford is in tier 3, fans still cannot attend. The 80th Manchester derby to be played there is the first behind closed doors. It is a dreadfully dull game and the lack of passion on and off the pitch cripples the spectacle. These sporting cathedrals were built to enable many people to watch football together. The sermon is still being preached but there is no congregation, no hymns to reverberate round the cobwebbed pews.Football grounds are also places for socialising, for seeing friends and for escaping reality for a few precious hours. It is not for nothing that fans refer to their ground as “home”. Think about why West Ham greeted their fans back with a welcome home message, why there is a banner inside Old Trafford saying “we can’t wait to welcome you home”. For millions of fans, their club’s ground is a place where they feel safe and secure, where they can share emotions both good and bad.So here we are now, seven months on from the restart of football. This pandemic has reinforced how important fans are to the game: they are the foundation on which these clubs are built. Players come and go, but the fan is there, supporting their teams with pride and passion.I look on with envy as grounds are packed out in Australia and New Zealand while our national game limps on through the hardest of winters. I can’t wait for it to break free of this cocoon-like state and a return to the football we all know and love.For Daff, a great man who loved his family, his football and his photography."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2671e6b6d3eef7d2c3f563b48179fb9494774dc6/88_165_888_532/master/888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84549adc840b365a01a5f93061067f4a","title":"david squires on footballs festive faux pas","story":"Our cartoonist looks back at ill-judged decisions made by footballers, clubs, politicians and more over the Christmas period"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d253b98121f452fc32f3f0f0bbd5f66ba71a8fc4/0_921_2513_1506/master/2513.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6d54c6494d9baf526e0ef6958c88cc80","title":"are you keeping your christmas decorations up longer this year","story":"We’d like to hear from people who’re planning on keeping their Christmas decorations up longer this year.

It’s sad, but we’ve got to get this virus under control.”However, UK Music, the umbrella organisation representing the commercial music industry, said the government needed to act fast to support the live music industry – including guaranteeing cancellation insurance – or festivals would have to be cancelled.“Government is rolling out the vaccine and is openly speculating about returning to normal by the spring,” said Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, the chief executive of UK Music. “But there is a serious risk that even if this proves to be a reality, lack of notice and available insurance options will mean much of the 2021 summer music season can’t go ahead. The clock is ticking, and any day soon we could see major festivals and events start pulling the plug for lack of certainty. There will need to be a concerted effort from industry and the government together.”UK Music’s plan, which is detailed in a report entitled Let the Music Play: Save Our Summer, highlights six key actions the government must take to support the industry.The most important is a government-backed indemnity scheme that operates as a form of Covid insurance by providing financial support if festivals are affected by coronavirus, similar to a scheme that has kept film and TV production rolling in the UK. Last month, Germany announced a €2.5bn (£2.3bn) event cancellation fund.In addition, UK Music is asking for an “indicative” date for when venues and events can move back to full capacity, and an extension to a VAT rate reduction on tickets and business rates relief. In November, it said tens of thousands out of the almost 200,000 people who worked in the industry were at risk of losing their jobs.In June, Michael Eavis, said Glastonbury festival could go bankrupt if it had to be cancelled again this year. Last month, Emily Eavis said Glastonbury lost “millions” in 2020, adding: “We’re still quite a long way from being able to say we’re confident 2021 will go ahead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a36e29c46f268828a2732cf3e6474bc2c586a8/0_340_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80c6fdf0f8965e8cd70d3524f8fce50c","title":"burning the furniture my life as a consumer","story":"Some thoughts on buying a house, white privilege and homewares for the apocalypseWhat does it say about capitalism, John asks, that we have money and want to spend it but we can’t find anything worth buying? We’re on our way home from a furniture store, again. We almost bought something called a credenza, but then John opened the drawers and discovered that it wasn’t made to last.I think there are limits, I say, to what mass production can produce.We just bought a house but we don’t have furniture yet. We’ve been eating on our back stoop for three months. Last week a Mexican woman with four children rang our doorbell and asked if our front room was for rent. I’m sorry, I said awkwardly, we live here. She was confused. But, she said, it’s empty.It is empty. I hang curtains to hide the emptiness, but it remains empty. There wasn’t any furniture in the house where I grew up until a German cabinetmaker moved in with us. He arrived in a truck so heavy that it made a dent in the driveway. He filled our dining room with his furniture, and then he made tiny replicas of that furniture with the machines he brought in the truck. I still have the tiny corner cabinet with lattice doors, the tiny hutch with brass knobs and the tiny dining room table with expertly turned legs. They’re in the basement, wrapped in newspaper. The tiny dresser sits atop my dresser, which is from Ikea.The apartment we just left was furnished with shelves that John made out of cheap pine. They’re in the basement now, reduced to lumber. The ammunition box that I found on the kerb and made into a coffee table is in the back yard, planted full of marigolds. I hate furniture, my father once murmured. He had just visited a warehouse full of furniture made of unfinished pine. This was after the cabinetmaker went to a nursing home and his furniture went away, too. As a child, I burned a hole in the dining room table. The cabinetmaker, who smoked a pipe, supplied me with matches. I loved to burn things, but I felt remorse over the table, which I also loved.The lyric “I burned a hole in the dining room table” is tethered, in my mind, to the liner notes of a Billie Holiday album that I borrowed from the library in college. She was singing songs written by someone else, the notes explained, but she rewrote them with the way she sang. Her delivery transformed a banal portrait of moneyed life into a wry critique of that moneyed life.In the furniture stores we visit, I’m filled with a strange unspecific desire. I want everything and nothing. The soft colours of the rugs, the warm wood grains, the brass and glass of the lamps all seem to suggest that the stores are filled with beautiful things, but when I look at any one thing I don’t find it beautiful. “The desire to consume is a kind of lust,” Lewis Hyde wrote. “But consumer goods merely bait this lust, they do not satisfy it. The consumer of commodities is invited to a meal without passion, a consumption that leads to neither satiation nor fire.”In the end, all the furniture we buy will feel like lyrics written for someone else’s song, except the dining room table made by the Amish. This table will be solid cherry, a beautiful wood. It will be well made, but not quite as well made as the table I grew up with, the table I burned. To get a table like that, we would need to spend much more money. Or we would need a German cabinetmaker to move in with us.“I once had a girl  Or I should say, she once had me,” the car radio sings. John and I both fall silent. It’s been a long time since I’ve heard this song. And I don’t know if I’ve ever really listened to the ending. What happened there, I wonder. Did he make a fire in the fireplace while the girl was at work? No, John tells me, he burned her place down. He is sure of this, but I am not so sure.I can’t stop thinking about it. Norwegian Wood. It bothers me. Soon I’m reading interviews with the Beatles. “It was pine really, cheap pine,” McCartney said about the wood panelling that inspired the title. About the ending, he said: “It could have meant I lit a fire to keep myself warm, and wasn’t the decor of her house wonderful? But it didn’t, it meant I burned the fucking place down.”Our house is a brick bungalow, nearly identical to the house next door. These houses were built by brothers, both dead now. I learn this from my neighbour, who lives in the other brother’s house. He’s a retired postal worker and a saxophone player who still practises every day, though his health is now too poor for him to perform. The interiors of our houses are the same, he tells me, except for my attic, which the former owners of our house renovated. He would like to renovate his attic, too, but he doesn’t have the money. Some relatives of his are in prison and all his extra money goes to supporting their families. I guess God, he says, doesn’t want me to have money. I’m not sure, but I think he’s joking about God.He has told me, already, about attending the same elementary school my son attends, and of being beaten up in the playground.He has told me that he couldn’t, in those days, risk a conversation with a woman like me. He had to keep his head down when he passed a white woman on the sidewalk, he said, and just respond Yes, ma’am if she spoke to him. He has told me, also, of refusing a holiday turkey offered to him by the owner of a mansion by the lake, a rich man who demanded that he wade through deep snow to deliver packages to the service entrance at the back of the house.The former owners of our house, who were white, made extra money by allowing the house to be used as a set for commercials. John discovers this when he gets a call from a casting director who wants to know if the house is available. It’s not available – we live here. But then we learn how much we will be paid. All we have to do is leave the house for three days and two nights and we will earn $8,000.The commercial is going to be for Walmart, the corporation that produced the fortunes of three of the 20 richest people in this country. Walmart couldn’t build stores in Chicago for years but they’re here now, despite ongoing protests over low wages, and they want their commercial set in a classic Chicago bungalow. We don’t own anything from Walmart, but this doesn’t matter because Walmart furniture is moved into the house, Walmart curtains are put up, and some Walmart prints are hung on the walls in Walmart frames. A white set designer and a white director work to create an authentic African American interior. The commercial, they tell us, is going to feature an African American grandmother serving a holiday turkey.Next door, in the house just like ours, lives an actual African American grandmother, the wife of the retired postal worker.We’re getting paid to have our house made over to look like what a set designer imagines their house looks like so that Walmart can try to sell things to people who look like them.John tells all this to his friend Dan, who says, I think that’s the definition of white privilege. I don’t understand, my mother says. How is that the definition of white privilege? This isn’t the first punchline she’s ruined. My mother dropped out of high school and later, after college and a orce, she nearly dropped out of the middle class. She still has white privilege, but she often does not have hot water.I admire how thoroughly she has discarded the life she was born into, the silver in the sideboard and the opera on the record player. She has kept only the books.In one of the fairy tales she told me as a child, a girl is pursued by a witch. As the girl runs, she throws behind her the things she carries in her pockets, the things her mother has given her. She throws down a hairbrush that becomes a thick forest. She throws down a hand mirror that becomes a lake between her and the witch. You must throw away everything you’ve been given, my mother might say. That much I understand. But it has only just occurred to me to wonder what witch she’s running from. And if her witch will be my witch, too.She used to trade eggs from her chickens to a neighbour for expired bread, still good. And when she drove us home from school she would stop at a dumpster behind a restaurant to salvage fruit, also still good. I once asked my mother if she had a retirement account and she laughed at me. I’ve never had anything like that, she said. And then she said, after a pause, My children are my retirement account. You were my investment.She had four children by the time she was 30, but she had no income, no contributions to social security. I was without children at thirty and already working for the university. I have a retirement account, which puts me in a poor position to explain privilege to my mother. Nobody understands privilege as well as those who don’t have it. I guess, I tell her, I don’t understand, either.I’m taking possession of the house by painting it, every room. And the question of what colour in what room is consuming me. I think maybe I should start with historical colours, but I can see the original colour of the walls under the layers of chipped paint: cloying pink. Maybe memory, not history, is the place to start. Buttered Yam, from my mother’s garden. Evening Blue, an old bottle half-buried in the dirt. Forest Moss, the colour of my mother’s little living room, which smelled like woodsmoke.Color(ed) Theory Suite, a work in which artist Amanda Williams painted houses slated for demolition on the South Side of Chicago, began as a collection of colours: Harold’s Chicken Shack Red, Crown Royal Purple, Pink Oil, Ultrasheen Blue, Flamin’ Hot Orange, Currency Exchange Yellow. “This palette combined my Ivy League academic training as an architect with my lived sensibility as a South Side native,” she says. Each house was painted a single colour, from the bricks of the foundation to the shingles on the roof. She painted only houses that weren’t worth anything to anyone – not to dealers, not to squatters, not to neighbourhood teenagers. “Zero-value” was her term. And she painted these zero-value properties in colours drawn from products sold to black people. Every colour, she says, is a code.I’m having trouble finding the right white. I don’t like Opulence White or Chantilly Lace or French Manicure. This conversation is boring, my sister complains. Maybe I’ll give up on white, I tell her, and paint the living room peach. Peach is problematic, she says, laughing at me now.I’ve discovered a brand of paint that I can’t afford. But I could buy it. To afford something like paint, for someone of my class, is to announce your values, most often, not your financial capacity. I can’t admit to valuing paint that costs $110 a gallon. But I find this paint unbearably luminous, and undeniably better than any other paint. At night, when my family is asleep, I study paint swatches from the hardware store and then I open the heavy folds of the catalogue from Farrow \u0026amp Ball and run my fingers over the small squares of paint, slightly raised in estate emulsion. Even the names are better: Matchstick, String, Cord, Skimming Stone. These are not aspirational whites – these whites can afford to be modest. One is even called Blackened.I remember the great revelation of moving up from acrylic paints in high school to oil paints in college. First just black and white on paper, and then a full set on canvas. They were worth the expense, those silken oils in their slim metal tubes. I loved all the colours, especially the cadmium orange, which was slightly toxic. Flamin’ hot. This is the closest I’ve come to painting in years, shopping for paint.I send a swatch of Sulking Room Pink to Robyn, knowing she’ll appreciate the name. “To sulk” in French is bouder, the source of boudoir, a woman’s private room. A room of one’s own, in a dusty, moneyed pink. And then there’s Etiquette, a white described as “a well-mannered hue”. It’s a white that’s hiding behind its own whiteness. Another line for this white poem. My mind is on paint now more often than poetry. I’ve found a new literature: Crisp Linen, Collector’s Item, White Zinfandel, Pashmina, Fine China, Ivory Tower, Mirage White, American White.The paint company Benjamin Moore has declared Simply White the Colour of the Year. This, in 2016, the year a white man will be elected to the White House. The selection of white as the Colour of the Year was “inevitable,” the creative director of Benjamin Moore says. “The colour white is transcendent, powerful, and polarising – it is either taken for granted or obsessed over.”I obsess, which solves nothing. Deep in Thought is my favourite name for a white, but I don’t really like the colour. I wouldn’t want my walls Deep in Thought. On my way to a parent-teacher conference I stop in the hallway of the elementary school to photograph a huge box of institutional toilet paper, the colour listed on the label as Empathy White. Maybe that’s the colour I’m looking for. Or a variant, a concerned off-white like All Apologies. Or something more revealing, like Paperwork White or Payroll White. Or maybe I should just paint it all Property.The catalogues keep coming. I don’t know how they find us, or how to make them stop. Sometimes, two of the same catalogue arrive on the same day. They accumulate in piles, outdoing each other with heavier paper and richer colours. Then the Restoration Hardware catalogue arrives, like a parody of the whole problem, in two volumes, each the size of a telephone book. These are bigger and heavier than my grandfather’s two-volume set of Illustrated English Social History. We put the Restoration Hardware catalogues near the fireplace and sit on them.The Ikea catalogue has a message on the front: “Designed for people, not consumers.” In the photograph, some young people are having a fun, unfussy dinner at a crowded table. There are dirty dishes piled on a cart and a guitar is leaning against the wall. The Ikea catalogue sits on top of a pile of catalogues with photographs of sterile rooms showcasing furniture that has never been touched. This other, messier way of life, Ikea suggests, is not just less expensive, it is more human.John and I have a set of two dressers from Ikea, and Nick and Robyn have the same two dressers. Nick’s is his second of this dresser – the bottoms dropped out of all the drawers in the first one. It was like a building with a perfect facade, Robyn said, where all the floors had collapsed into the basement. I remember a brownstone in New York City like that, with trees growing inside. And a foreclosure in the suburbs still pristine on the outside, but stripped of all its fixtures inside, even the wires and the pipes.The dresser is simple and Shaker in its design. Shakers believed that the end of the world was near, which would seem to be an argument for temporary furniture, but making something built to last was, for them, an act of prayer. “Do all your work as if you had 1,000 years to live,” Mother Ann Lee told her brethren, “and as you would if you knew you must die tomorrow.”There aren’t many Shakers left. Their furniture has outlasted them, as it was meant to. Their values, I was told by a tour guide at the village where Ann Lee died, which I visited as a school child, were embodied in their furniture. I wonder if a Shaker dresser, taken out of the context of Shaker life, still embodies the Shaker dedication to celibacy and hard work. Perhaps it whispers to its owner at night. Maybe my dresser is where my doubts come from.In that village, I saw Shaker chairs hung on pegs and I was taught to sing a Shaker song. The furniture didn’t interest me, but I was captivated by the song, especially the last two lines: “To turn, turn, will be our delight  Till by turning, turning, we come round right.”In my 20s I moved 10 times. On the fourth or fifth move, when I was leaving New York, I left behind a bed frame that my mother had made. It was simple and spare with no headboard – Shaker almost – and designed for celibacy in that it was narrower than a single bed. My mother was upset when she learned that I had abandoned it. I tried to explain that I wasn’t leading a life that allowed for furniture.In California, I slept on a slab of foam that could easily be rolled up and moved anywhere. My boyfriend, who kept his clothes in a large cardboard box, suggested that we make all our furniture out of cardboard boxes. It was an idea that had already been pioneered by Ikea, who made chipboard end tables with hollow interiors. “The ease of self-invention that Ikea enables is liberating,” Lauren Collins wrote, “but it can be sad to be able to make a life, or dispose of it, so cheaply.” Within a year, I had rolled up my mattress and moved my boxes to Iowa, where I found my furniture on the street.“A better everyday life for the many people” is Ikea’s mission, on paper. I think of all the Ikea furniture that I have seen eaten by life. The end tables with broken legs, the cracked slats of futon frames, the chipboard desks left out on the kerb and destroyed by the rain before they can be taken to a new home. Ikea, one of the largest consumers of wood in the world, has made furniture into something that gets used up. It is furniture for the apocalypse. But what I like – what makes me laugh a little about “for people, not consumers” – is the implication that consumers are not people.‘A metaphor is all this really is,” David Graeber wrote. He means consumption, which was once the name for a wasting disease, and is now the word anthropologists use for almost everything we do outside of work – eating, shopping, reading, listening to music. Consume, he notes, is from the Latin consumere, meaning “to seize or take over completely”. A person might consume food or be consumed by rage. In its earliest usage, consumption always implied destruction.Consumption was the opposite of production in Adam Smith’s Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. He made this inquiry in 1776, when work was being relocated into factories and lives were newly ided between home and work. We still use the maths of that time to subtract what is consumed at home from what is produced at work. In that crude equation, only work that earns money is productive.And as long as there’s no third quantity, like reproduction, the equation works out to zero.She ate it, my father told my sister years ago, when she wondered what happened to my stereo. This was during my first year in New York, and the money for the stereo was a gift from my father, who had told me that he would pay for my college tuition and nothing else, ever. He had three more children to send to college. The stereo was an exception, a surprise for my birthday, and I did eat it. I wanted a stereo but I needed food.Food is destroyed by our consumption, but silverware is not, though the metaphor behind the word suggests that we eat up even our own silverware and dishes, too. “We should think about how far we want to extend the metaphor,” Graeber warned. Yes, we consume fossil fuels, in the “eat up, devour, waste, spend” sense of the word. But we don’t consume music.Music becomes part of us, as food does, but it isn’t destroyed in the process.What is destroyed when we think of ourselves as consumers, Graeber suggested, is the possibility that we might be doing something productive outside of work. • This is an edited extract from Having and Being Had by Eula Biss, published by Faber \u0026amp Faber and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, sign up to the long read weekly email here, and find our podcasts here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4608e0462b20002432926f3d090b46882ce28c9/0_2_6048_3627/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa47d7879695a5d8544bb51ba605e4fe","title":"how greenhouse gases are actually cooling earths upper atmosphere","story":"At high altitudes, carbon dioxide releases energy into space, making the atmosphere contractIn all the discussions about climate change, one thing is often overlooked – the upper atmosphere of Earth is actually cooling while the lower atmosphere grows warmer, and this strange paradox is a clear fingerprint of greenhouse gases at work.Carbon dioxide in the lower atmosphere helps trap heat from the sun’s solar energy reflected off the Earth’s surface and so, like a greenhouse, the lower atmosphere grows warmer. But at high altitudes it is a different story, because the upper atmosphere is so thin that the carbon dioxide releases its energy into space and so the upper atmosphere cools. And that cooling is also making the upper atmosphere contract.Past studies have shown that the cooling trend is driven by greenhouse gases, as well as shifts in the Earth’s magnetic field and the roughly 11-year cycle in the sun’s solar activity. A recent study disentangled these different factors by simulating the upper atmosphere at 100-500km altitude from 1950 to 2015. The results confirmed that rising carbon dioxide levels were the main driving force cooling the upper atmosphere. Shifts in the Earth’s magnetic field and variations in the solar cycle played much smaller roles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/627a7ae7cf3e229bcd01f53ad25ca7700df2329f/0_0_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=936c017d55c77a3fbdf42349e3ef4b1c","title":"today in focus revisited the clitoris coverup why do we know so little podcast","story":"Medical textbooks are full of anatomical pictures of the penis, but the clitoris barely rates a mention and many medical professionals are uncomfortable even talking about it.

Dr Julia Patterson, the lead for Everydoctor, said doctors fear that delaying the second dose they need to obtain full immunity could lead to them becoming ill or infecting colleagues or patients.“The Covid-19 crisis is escalating and we need to urgently protect those who are working on the frontline. If healthcare workers are left unprotected, they are at risk themselves, and they may also pass coronavirus on to vulnerable patients,” said Patterson.“We were pleased to see last week that healthcare staff would now be vaccinated as a priority. However, five days on, many staff members are still in the dark about when they will receive vaccines.” Hospitals should now lay on clinics to immunise as many staff as fast as supplies of both vaccines allow, she added.Karoline Lamb, 84, said she was “absolutely fuming” that she might not be able to get the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine: “I was so elated when I had the first one. I had no side-effects and I’m booked in for the second one on 21 January, but I’m extremely worried it will be cancelled.”Lamb, from Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire, is concerned that the first dose risks “becoming ineffective”. “If I don’t get the second one within three weeks, I’m worried the first dose could do more harm than good. Had I known the government might not let me have the second dose in time, I would not have accepted the first one.”Meanwhile, close to 3.5m doses of the Oxford vaccine are awaiting release after undergoing checks by medical regulators, the  understands, amid calls for the rollout of the jab to be accelerated in what Labour has described as “a race against time”.The government has said that it already has a batch of 530,000 doses to be administered this week and Sir John Bell, Oxford University’s regius professor of medicine, had said a further 450,000 were due to be available at the start of the week. Several million more doses of the vaccine are understood to have been manufactured in the UK but are yet to be bottled in vials.The NHS will need to start delivering at least 2m jabs a week from next week if it is to fulfil the Boris Johnson’s plan to vaccinate everyone in the four highest-priority groups by mid-February. The four groups the prime minister said will have a first dose amount to 13.9 million people in England, according to Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister.Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, said on 30 December that his company would be able to provide 2m doses a week. But Matt Hancock, the health secretary, appeared to play down the possibility of reaching that level when the figure was put to him on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday. Hancock said: “John Bell is a great man, but he is not responsible for AstraZeneca’s manufacturing facility.”Labour’s shadow health secretary, John Ashworth, said: “Ministers should be going hell for leather to get 2m jabs a week distributed as soon as possible and then scale up further. We know this virus can mutate and could well do so again. We are in a race against time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22c51277a4154e8d3335d1c4b7016d94dc7eeb3f/0_130_3400_2039/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ac2f83b65a414158a2df6d42d661ebd","title":"cricket second test south africa sri lanka match report","story":"South Africa completed a sweep of their two match series against Sri Lanka as they strolled to a 10-wicket win on the third day of the second Test on Tuesday.The hosts knocked off a target of 67 runs without loss as openers Dean Elgar (31 not out) and Aiden Markram (36 not out) saw them to victory at the Wanderers Stadium with two-and-a-half days of the contest still remaining.Sri Lanka had shown signs of fight on Monday but their batsmen surrendered their final six wickets within 95 minutes of Tuesday’s morning session. Resuming on 150 for four, they were bowled out for 211 in their second innings, leaving South Africa a double-digit target.The tourists’ captain, Dimuth Karunaratne, resumed on 91 and reached his 10th Test century off 123 balls, but a misjudged pull shot saw him caught by Wiaan Mulder off the bowling of Anrich Nortje. He was dismissed for 103 and his departure marked the beginning of the end.Niroshan Dickwella (36) followed in the next over as Lungi Ngidi (four for 44) took another crucial wicket, setting off an end to the resistance among the lower order. Lutho Sipamla cleaned up the tail with three wickets in 12 balls, including bowling Wanindu Hasaranga for 16, to finish with figures of three for 40.“We wanted to turn the pressure over on to South Africa but unfortunately they bowled really well,” Karunaratne said afterwards. Sri Lanka, who won the toss and elected to bat, scored 157 in their first innings and South Africa replied with 302, with Elgar top scoring on 127.Success for the Proteas in Johannesburg follows a convincing innings and 45-run triumph in the first Test in Pretoria last week and turns around a poor run of Test form over the last year.Winning captain Quinton de Kock said: “We wanted to get the new year off to a good start, and it was good to see our experienced batsmen among the runs as well as our young bowling lineup putting up their hands.Sri Lanka will now return home to host England in two Tests. Joe Root’s side are already in Sri Lanka, but their preparations have been disrupted by Moeen Ali’s positive Covid-19 test. The first match is due to begin at Galle on 14 Jan, while South Africa now look ahead to their first visit in 14 years to Pakistan, where they will play two Tests and three T20 games later this month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/768c8c6fbb16a9164ee5055ef68c02dadb625a71/20_143_4650_2791/master/4650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fae2a2e1c52e5eaa14e96fc37cf3833","title":"time to put self interest aside and find a solution to save the lions rugby","story":"Unions, clubs, TV executives and sponsors can no longer act in isolation if a feasible solution for this summer is to be foundRarely, if ever, has rugby union been in greater need of a silver bullet to solve all its problems. As older readers will remember that was once the Lone Ranger’s trademark, along with the habitual use of a mask to conceal his identity. How rugby’s Covid-threatened administrators would love a face-covered modern saviour to appear from nowhere and rescue their sport from looming oblivion.The mundane reality, unfortunately, is that unions, clubs, television executives and sponsors can no longer act in isolation. Even if the British \u0026amp Irish Lions somehow manage to unearth a feasible solution which preserves their scheduled tour of South Africa this summer, it is unlikely to satisfy everyone. What works for one party is invariably someone’s else’s non-starter.Which is why, with the virus showing all the tenacity of a back-row forward with a persistent grudge, this is no time for self interest. If the Lions’ pride is to be upheld for decades it will only be because the major unions, the clubs and all other stakeholders work together to protect it. Anything less than a genuine collective heave and the whole glorious concept could be permanently compromised.Take, for example, the idea that the Lions tour, given current rising infection rates and the uncertainty surrounding travelling fans, could simply be delayed a year until 2022. Even for the host nation that would be less than ideal, with the defence of their World Cup title in 2023 just over the horizon. For Eddie Jones, whose preparations for that tournament are already well advanced, there is absolutely nothing to be gained from waving his best 20-odd players off to South Africa just as he is looking to coalesce them into an England squad capable of beating the world.It will, accordingly, take a brave man to tell Jones to lump it for the sake of a team who only tour once every four years, or a South African union who badly need the income. Unless Jason Leonard, the Lions’ chairman, can somehow force the RFU’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, into an old-style arm lock and murmur the ultimate threat – “If we can’t tour you’ll be here drinking with me every night” – it is even harder to see Twickenham subverting their own interests beneath those of the Lions committee. Money always talks and winning the 2023 World Cup would be worth rather more to England than a Lions series win over the Springboks.At this point it is worth gauging the view from South Africa. Informed sources contacted by the  suggest that, if this summer’s incoming tour is a non-runner, their next preference would be for a postponement until either November or the summer of 2022. That, though, would require World Rugby to e headfirst into the argument and rip up a global tour schedule which has already been widely advertised. Would Ireland fancy heading to New Zealand for a three-Test series without their best players? No chance.The next line down on the wishlist would be to shift the whole “tour” to Britain and Ireland, a perfectly fine idea in theory but one which also relies heavily on spectators being present. There would also be a host of other issues. Would a Lions series feel remotely the same beast if it took place on home soil? Who, exactly, would supply the midweek opposition with every major European club side on holiday? With the Euros, Wimbledon, the Open golf and the Olympics already in the diary, would it end up, perversely, damaging the special aura that makes the Lions so wonderfully different?The absolute last resort, it seems, would be to play the games in South Africa with no fans. For anyone who has ever been on a Lions tour it is the grimmest scenario of the lot. What is the point of the Lions if it is not a cavalcade of human enjoyment, a catalyst for camaraderie and a union of four nations on and off the field? If there is any sporting event on Earth less suited to being played in a soulless bubble, it is a winner-takes-all series involving the Boks and the Lions.No real sign, then, of a silver bullet, particularly as northern hemisphere officials are pushing for an early decision. By contrast, there are those who believe infection rates in South Africa are destined to fall within a matter of weeks. If, on the other hand, this year’s Lions tour were to be mothballed now it might allow the Six Nations to be delayed and played, complete with crowds, in July and August instead. Not ideal, clearly, with so much other sport around but better than another soul-sapping, echo chamber of a championship. To have one Six Nations championship played partly behind closed doors in 2020 was bad enough for rugby’s coffers. To have another entire tournament played out in silence would be ruinous.It would be more sensible, surely, to take a longer-term view. If South Africa cannot host this Lions tour they could be guaranteed the next edition in 2025 ahead of Australia. If the touring side were to step aside this summer the blow could also be eased by the firm promise of extra preparation time and a proper 10-match schedule next time. After an eight-year hiatus, the appetite for the returning Lions would be huge, their worth more cherished than ever. By then, too, people might even have started to forget the grim winter of 2020-21, the heavy toll it exacted and the money-driven masquerade that Test rugby almost became.Among the more welcome developments of the past 12 months has been the return of an old friend. Last February the sensational 90-metre torpedo kick by the French full-back Anthony Bouthier – dubbed the “spiral that went viral” – was among the highlights of the entire 2020 Six Nations. On Sunday it was the turn of Leicester’s George Ford to showcase the vertical spiral bomb, an old Dave Alred-inspired favourite that dips and fades as it descends from the clouds. Poor Anthony Watson could barely lay a hand on the ball and the Tigers duly emerged victorious. People often complain there is too much kicking in rugby union: what they generally mean is that there is too much poor kicking. A great kick, on the other hand, remains athing of beauty.Last weekend lightning struck twice. Leinster and Exeter, both recently immune to defeat, contrived to lose on the same day, with the Irish province suffering their first Pro14 reverse in 27 games at home to Connacht. If something similar were to happen this week, at home to Ulster and Bristol respectively, it really would be a jolt to the established order. On the basis that form is temporary and class permanent, however, it might be wise not to bet on another improbable double."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e227a59d8ab317e2e4c80dbd5230b2a552bfa65e/0_610_3467_2081/master/3467.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=41e18fe73be2d886a2238394ed31ffd7","title":"hamburg harbour urban beach scene travel photograph celia topping","story":"Our series on evocative travel images continues with Celia Topping’s shot of a carefree volleyball game at an urban beachI’d only been to Hamburg once before: in the depths of winter, when hunkering down in a dingy St Pauli bar was the main aim of the trip. But Hamburg in summer is a different story.On a sweltering day in August, I hired a bike and went west, out of the city centre, along the River Elbe. I had been told there were urban beaches along the river and I was keen to take a look.Away from the city’s hustle, I stopped to admire a cheerful-looking red lighthouse at the water’s edge. A terrace of cafes and restaurants looked over the river, with waiters rushing to and fro with large trays of beer and snacks for their many customers. Over the other side I could see a long stretch of sand, teeming with sunseekers.A narrow path led behind the restaurants, parallel to the beach. On my right were dainty, picture-perfect wooden houses, with roses around the door and parasols peeking jauntily from windows. Gardens belonging to the houses were on the other side of the path to my left, with families playing on the grass and elderly couples sipping cool drinks in the shade.Beyond the gardens was a beach scene like no other. A strip of sand, maybe 50 metres wide, was packed with people sunbathing, building sandcastles, playing beach games and generally doing what people do on beaches. It seemed like all of Hamburg was on the beach that day. But what made it extraordinary was the backdrop. Immense container ships cruised past, causing waves to crash on the shore for excited young children to jump over. And on the far side of the river stood colossal industrial cranes, like giant metal beasts, surveying the sun-drenched spectacle.I walked a little further, past the Ahoi Strandkiosk, and found a spare metre of sand to myself. A group of friends were enthusiastically playing volleyball in the water in front of me. I took a crafty shot, thinking they might not appreciate having their photo taken. But it soon became apparent that no one on this gorgeous summer’s day gave a hoot about some woman taking photos on a crowded beach. I snapped away at everything and everyone. This scene is a favourite because of the moment of carefree happiness captured between friends, against the backdrop of the city’s harbour giants – those majestic metal cranes.• Celia Topping is a photographer and journalist based in Berlin and London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dba4ef49faf5c94cfc8fd81e50b13cd0d3caeeec/0_284_5780_3470/master/5780.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5cc8929536078e1107b1d27b352cb99e","title":"wisconsin pharmacist covid 19 vaccine doses steven brandenburg","story":"Officers say Steven Brandenburg told investigators he intentionally tried to spoil the doses because he believed the vaccine could change DNAA Wisconsin pharmacist who was convinced the world was “crashing down” told police he tried to ruin hundreds of doses of coronavirus vaccine because he believed the shots would mutate people’s DNA, according to court documents released on Monday.Police in Grafton, about 20 miles north of Milwaukee, arrested Steven Brandenburg of Advocate Aurora Health last week after an investigation into the 57 spoiled vials of the Moderna vaccine, which officials say contained enough doses to inoculate more than 500 people. Charges are pending.“He’d formed this belief they were unsafe,” Adam Gerol, the Ozaukee county district attorney, said during a virtual hearing. The prosecutor added that Brandenburg was upset because he was in the midst of orcing his wife, and an Aurora employee said Brandenburg had taken a gun to work twice.A detective wrote in a probable cause statement that Brandenburg, 46, was an admitted conspiracy theorist and that he told investigators he intentionally tried to ruin the vaccine because it could hurt people by changing their DNA.Misinformation about the Covid-19 vaccines has surged online with false claims circulating on everything from the vaccines’ ingredients to possible side-effects.One of the earliest false claims suggested that the vaccines could alter DNA. The PfizerBioNTech vaccine as well as the Moderna vaccine rely on messenger RNA or mRNA, which is a fairly new technology used in vaccines that experts have been working on for years.Such vaccines help train the immune system to identify the spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus and create an immune response. Experts have said there is no truth to the claims that the vaccines can genetically modify humans.Jeff Bahr, the Advocate Aurora Health Care chief medical group officer, has said Brandenburg admitted that he deliberately removed the vials from refrigeration at the Grafton medical center overnight on 24 December into 25 December, returned them, then left them out again on the night of 25 December into Saturday.A pharmacy technician discovered the vials outside the refrigerator on 26 December.Brandenburg’s attorney, Jason Baltz, did not speak on the merits of the case during the hearing. Gerol held off on filing any charges, saying he still needed to determine whether Brandenburg actually destroyed the doses.Judge Paul Malloy ordered Brandenburg held on a $10,000 signature bond on the condition that he surrender his firearms, not work in healthcare and have no contact with Aurora employees.Brandenburg is in the process of orcing his wife of eight years. The couple has two small children.According to an affidavit Brandenburg’s wife filed, he visited her on 6 December and dropped off a water purifier and two 30-day supplies of food, telling her the world was “crashing down”.He had also said the government was planning cyber-attacks and was going to shut down the power grid.She added that he was storing food in bulk along with guns in rental units and she no longer felt safe around him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81c5d7a3f4478702b18d64140486f8fb62438f7b/245_1096_3819_2291/master/3819.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9525287ee90e1ba0d6902c8a678e1993","title":"covid vaccinations slow start around world dose reality","story":"Burst of optimism over approvals has been followed by delays, shortages and bureaucratic errorsThe global introduction of newly approved coronavirus vaccines has been marked by delays, shortages and bureaucratic errors as it has become clear that many governments will miss their targets for mass inoculation.The burst of optimism that arrived with approvals of new vaccines – encouraged by unrealistic expectations raised by politicians – is colliding with the reality of the challenge of vaccinating a large part of the world’s population.The vast scale of the effort by pharmaceutical companies to produce and package doses is already seeing strains through shortages of “fill and finish” materials such as the glass vials used for the vaccine.Other chokepoints involve the capacity of regulatory authorities to approve packaged batches of vaccine, the effectiveness of national systems for vaccination, and local requirements for advising, monitoring and then logging the data of recipients, most of which is more time-consuming than giving the injection.So how are inidual countries doing?The US’s rollout of its vaccine programme has struggled, echoing the country’s chaotic response to the pandemic under Donald Trump.Out of about 17.5m doses of the PfizerBioNTech and Moderna vaccines that have been delivered around the country, only 4.2m have been administered, mainly comprising the first of two doses.That is far behind where the US planned to be at the end of 2020, when it had been hoped 20 million people would have been vaccinated. Reports have emerged of vaccines going bad due to poor organisation, lack of healthcare professionals to administer them or, in one case, sabotage.The biggest issue in the delays appears to be the fact that federal officials left delivery logistics to local health officials and hospitals, even as they were struggling to deal with the impact of a pandemic that has killed more than 350,000 Americans. However, Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, said on Sunday he had seen “some little glimmer of hope” after 1.5m doses were administered in the previous 72 hours, a marked increase.Hailed as a success story for the initial speed of its vaccination campaign, Israeli media reported last week that the pace of the vaccination campaign means it is running low on purchased doses and may have to pause unless a new supply is negotiated.While Israel’s vaccination campaign – which has relied on the PfizerBioNTech vaccine that needs to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures – has been among the fastest in the world, its health minister, Yuli Edelstein, said his ministry may stop administering first doses for a short period, telling Channel 12 “there will be no shortage of the second dose”.A disconnect between different regulatory approval regimes for vaccines is also causing its own issues, not least a shortage of supplies in some countries. While the UK quickly approved the PfizerBioNTech vaccine for emergency use in the UK and has since approved a second, the European Medicines Agency adopted a slower regulatory process and with PfizerBioNTech so far the only vaccine permitted within the bloc it has led to more demand from EU countries than the company can yet deliver.It has warned there will be gaps in the supply of its vaccines until other vaccines are rolled out, with Uğur Şahin, the BioNTech chief executive, telling Germany’s Spiegel: “At the moment it doesn’t look good – a hole is appearing because there’s a lack of other approved vaccines and we have to fill the gap with our own vaccine.”The European commission said on Monday it was in discussions with Pfizer and BioNTech about the possibility of ordering more doses of their vaccine, in addition to the 300m shots already covered under an existing contract. It was not clear whether this would compete with a German deal for more doses of the same vaccine.Underlining the problem of vaccine supply, Germany and Denmark are also looking into the possibility of delaying administering a second dose of the vaccine to make scarce supplies go further, after a similar move by Britain last week.Within the EU, France has had its own specific issues that have meant its vaccination programme has progressed at a glacial pace so far.With one of the world’s most vaccine-sceptical populations, France had by the weekend only managed to inoculate 516 people compared with the UK’s 1 million, despite having 500,000 doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine.Critics have also pointed to the 200,000 people who have been immunised in Germany during a similar timeframe after the EU-wide rollout began a week ago. The figure in France rose to several thousand on Monday, according to the health minister, Olivier Véran.With a “hypercritical” public attitude towards vaccines – a survey at the weekend showed six out of 10 people intended to refuse one – France had settled on a slow and bureaucratic process, including a mandatory consultation with a doctor several days before receiving a jab. The president, Emmanuel Macron, has demanded a quicker rollout.One assumed advantage in national vaccination programmes is the presence of a well-developed manufacturing capacity, although that has not necessarily been the case in the US.While Indian regulators have only just approved the country’s first two Covid vaccines for restricted emergency use, one developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, and the other conceived locally by Bharat Biotech, India is home to the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines that will eventually provide doses for the Covax scheme to supply the developing world.For now, however, India’s emergency use authorisation means the vaccines will only be manufactured and made available in India, which with about 10m Covid-19 infections is one of the world’s worst-affected countries behind the US. Brazil is in talks to secure doses from India before a possible export ban.The country plans to inoculate 300 million frontline workers, elderly and vulnerable people out of its population of 1.35 billion by August and has a stockpile of more than 50m doses. India also has considerable experience in running mass vaccination campaigns.China, where Covid-19 originated, has (like Russia) pursued a typically aggressive approach to vaccine development and inoculation that has raised eyebrows in the west over claims of a lack of transparency in testing data.Four and a half million Chinese received doses of Chinese made vaccines under trial even before the approval last week of a vaccine produced by the state-owned Sinopharm company, with Beijing alone setting up 220 pop-up vaccination sites and delivering more than 73,000 shots in the first two days of 2021.The country aims to vaccinate 50 million people by February’s lunar new year in an attempt to control the spread of the virus when large parts of the population travel.Other countries including Egypt, which has approved Sinopharm’s vaccine for emergency use, and Pakistan have said they will use the Sinopharm vaccine as part of their response.South Africa, like other African nations, has found itself struggling to procure vaccines despite the global Covax initiative designed to ensure equitable supply of cheap vaccines to poorer countries.Although Pfizer and AstraZeneca have said they plan to supply doses, the US’s Moderna has no supplies for Africa, and the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be available before next year in South Africa, the continent’s worst-hit country with 1.09m confirmed infections and 29,175 deaths.African countries will also face problems such as a shortage of ultra-cold storage for the Pfizer vaccine and logistical issues for distribution. Experts have said the absence of effective vaccination in the developing world could leave reservoirs of disease, including new mutations, that will continue to threaten global outbreaks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33e09b0389c0436b60e3e49c0c07f877d17d8423/0_147_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fc8067cddfb5b98bac481968e40a5da","title":"faith leaders in england urge caution over covid lockdown exemption","story":"Churches and mosques weigh up risks after announcement that places of worship can remain openFaith leaders have urged caution after the government announced that places of worship in England could remain open despite heavy restrictions imposed in the latest coronavirus lockdown.The Church of England said some people “may feel that it is currently better not to attend in person” and that clergy who had concerns or were shielding should “take particular care and stay at home”.A statement from Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London, who is leading the C of E’s response to the pandemic, added: “We will continue to follow the guidance and ensure that churches remain as safe as possible.”But some clergy expressed anxiety over the exemption in the face of the virus’s spread.Alice Smith, the vicar of St John the Evangelist in Brownswood Park, north London, tweeted: “There’s a part of me that wishes we had been closed so as not to be going to bed with what feels like an impossible decision. Not in the least helped by being told by the Twittersphere either outcome is wrong, foolish or dangerous. Hey ho.”Smith told the  the “benefits of public worship are huge – especially as most of my congregation have poor access to technology”. But, she added, although she thought her church building was Covid-secure, “I’m conscious that a lot of people come to it for our soup kitchen and food bank.”She said: “I honestly don’t know what is the best thing to do. I would have been disappointed if the government had told us to close, but at least it would have been cut and dried.”Another vicar in the north of England wrote to a friend on Tuesday: “I’m really shocked. I feel as if someone thinks it’s fine to put me and people I know at risk. And if goes wrong, it will be because I wasn’t careful enough.”Harun Khan, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said some mosques in England had voluntarily suspended communal activities in recent weeks “out of precaution” and many Muslims had taken inidual decisions regarding the risks of going their mosque to pray.Mosques should take “tremendous care in choosing to remain open to the public”, and should provide online services and prayers for iniduals staying at home, he added.Qari Asim, the chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, said: “Voluntary closure of mosques should be considered by those mosques where risk assessments suggest that remaining open will pose a serious risk to the wellbeing of worshippers. Preservation of life is an important Islamic principle … None should feel pressured to attend a mosque during this pandemic.”The Board of Deputies of British Jews said synagogues must be “meticulous” in following Covid guidelines.However, the most senior Catholic in England and Wales was unequivocal in his response to the exemption for places of worship. “I am glad no measures have been introduced to obstruct or curtail this essential source of energy for the common good,” tweeted Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster and the most senior Catholic in England and Wales.During the November lockdown, Nichols urged the government to reverse its decision to ban communal worship, saying there was no evidence it would help combat the virus.In Scotland, places of worship were ordered to close under new restrictions that came into force on Tuesday. In Wales and Northern Ireland, they can remain open but must enforce social distancing measures.Funerals and weddings with restricted numbers are still permitted across the UK but receptions and wakes are banned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33023617f482d8f2fa0d42eb84586e1d863199c9/0_137_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbc7a45859bdfc0a1640a3821f4ce18e","title":"martin kenyon gets second covid vaccine dose","story":"Man who shot to fame after his first jab says process second time round was ‘very efficient’When Martin Kenyon went to receive his first coronavirus vaccination, his pithy responses after being accosted by a TV crew outside Guy’s hospital in London secured him “national treasure” status.He’d had trouble parking, and had consumed a “nasty lunch” before getting the jab after cold-calling Guy’s and asking for it, he told the CNN crew who fortuitously bumped into him immediately afterwards. And he was hoping, he said, that he was “not going to have the bloody bug now”.Now Kenyon, a sprightly 91-year-old, who found internet fame after his interview went viral, is one of the few who have received their second jab.“I went back to Guy’s, and, well, it’s become quite a machine there,” said Kenyon, an Old Etonian and Oxford man who was very active in the anti-apartheid movement, and was friends with Desmond Tutu, and personally met Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela.“When I went to get the first one, I was the only person there, I think. There was one man there, with a pencil and some paper and writing down a few names. This time it was very different. Very efficient.”Kenyon, who says the immunity from the vaccine means he can now hug his “enchanting” two grandchildren, said second-time round he had no trouble parking his “super little car”, which he is “allowed to drive everywhere around London, because I have a badge, which is brilliant”.“This time, I was able to park absolutely outside the main building in a special slot. So, all was well. It was very painless.”The UK has become the first western country to license a vaccine against Covid. On 8 December, Margaret Keenan, aged 90, became the the first patient in the world to receive it. The government’s joint committee on vaccination and immunisation has published a list of groups of people who will be prioritised to receive a vaccine for Covid-19. The list is:1 All those 80 years of age and over and health and social care workers.2 All those 75 and over.3 All those 70 and over.4 All those 65 and over.5 Adults under 65 at high at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.6 Adults under 65 at moderate risk of at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.7 All those 60 and over.8 All those 55 and over.9 All those 50 and over.10 Rest of the population.Kenyon’s recent fame saw him widely interviewed, including by Piers Morgan, causing further merriment when he asked ITV’s Good Morning co-host: “Who are you?”“I didn’t intend to be rude,” he says now. “I think when he was interviewing me I had bits of cotton wool in my ears, and the interview came from somewhere else that I couldn’t see. So, when I said ‘Who are you?’ I think I meant who’s talking, because I couldn’t see the interviewer.”Despite his vaccination, Kenyon intends to continue wearing a mask. “I was given a rather fancy one for my birthday by my daughter,” he said.“In a few days I will be immune. I don’t think I’ll pass anything on to anybody else. I think all will be well. And my family are very pleased.“I suppose it means I can do all sorts of things now. I can behave badly, now. I do most of the time, but generally in secret,” he joked. “I am, of course being very frivolous. But it’s new year, and I think we’ve got to cheer it up a bit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f101401cbe24bc0b57ac7b5ba674659f277a8e/0_2_1006_604/master/1006.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2ade9fca98715e5182660213cc145e93","title":"worst sequel yet what the papers say about englands third lockdown","story":"Boris Johnson’s announcement that England will enter its third national lockdown – and the toughest since March – is splashed across front pages.

The three Coalition leaders and at least six ministers will participate in the deliberations, with the final decision to be taken at Cabinet tomorrow.Mr Martin said he started his working life as a schoolteacher and remained passionate about education. There was no easy way to implement crude measures but “we have to err on the side of caution”.He said the school year had to be preserved and politicians had to think beyond next week.Asked about the benchmark for reopening schools, he said the trajectory of the disease had to be going in the opposite direction to the one it’s going in now.He said he wanted the Leaving Cert to take place in the traditional format in the summer, when a substantial portion of the population was vaccinated.January 30th would remain a review date.Mr Martin confirmed ministers were looking at special education and would have further engagement with that sector because many children with special needs regressed significantly during the last lockdown.A proposal to close schools for another two to three weeks, due to rising Covid-19 infections, will be discussed this Labour’s education spokesperson Aodhán Ó Ríordáin said he believes the decision not to reopen schools on Monday has already been made, and it was likely that schools would remain closed until the end of the month.It was not an easy decision for the Government, he acknowledged on Newstalk Breakfast on Tuesday morning, but it was one that needed to be announced as soon as possible.Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman is meeting with representatives of workers and employers in the childcare sector in advance of the sub-committee meeting, which he will attend. It is understood the discussion will focus on provision of childcare services this week, as well as gathering views from the sector on the approach to next week, and public health guidance in services.Last week, Mr O’Gorman announced that the State-funded ECCE programme would remain closed this week, while childcare services remaining open requested to provide services to priority groups. Earlier today, Siptu called for the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) to assess the risks to workers and children in childcare services, saying the sector should be prioritised for vaccination and that those working in it are “extremely frightened” about returning to work. It is understood that Minister of State for Special Education Josepha Madigan is pushing for dedicated provision to be made for special schools and special classes, up to and including keeping them open for some students even if the wider school system is shut down, similar to steps taken in the UK. Earlier, Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall said the Minister for Education Norma Foley had a responsibility to set out an Education Plan for the coming weeks. Education needed to continue, she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, especially for vulnerable children and those with special needs, along with the children of providers of essential services.A structured programme for remote education should be implemented, she said. Decisions would need to be taken soon with regard to this year’s State exams as a lot of students were very concerned. “This is a very anxious time, the sooner the situation is made clear the better.”The Government should take the advice of the Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan with regard to the reopening of schools, she urged. But she wanted a decision to be taken soon so families could plan.Meanwhile, the Teachers Union of Ireland (TUI) said schools were now better prepared for remote learning with a plan for continuity of learning. General secretary Michael Gillespie said guidance on remote teaching and learning in the Covid-19 context had been agreed for post-primary schools and centres for education.He told Newstalk Breakfast that schools were very unlikely to reopen on Monday January 11th and that the uncertainty was “not helping anybody.”The closure should last “at a minimum until the 18th” to see if the spread of the virus had been suppressed under the current restrictions.“We’re not calling for a long-term closure, we’re just talking for the minimum time possible to allow this. Schools will open, but they’ll open in a remote context and schools have planned for that.”Schools are likely to stay closed for at least another week and possibly until the end of January due to surging Covid-19 infections, according to senior political sources.Most Ministers privately believe that Cabinet will decide on Wednesday to delay the planned reopening of schools on January 11th, The  understands.However, officials may be asked to examine keeping certain schools open in Level 5 for pupils with special needs.Conversations are also taking place at a senior level about whether construction should remain open or not for the rest of the Level 5 lockdown.New virus case numbers on Monday surged to a new daily record of 6,110, making the current wave worse than the first one last spring.Dr Holohan, who spoke on Monday with Taoiseach Micheál Martin about the schools issue, said that even though incidence among schoolchildren was lower than for other age groups, it had increased “very, very fast”.Nphet was more concerned about transmission levels in this age group than it was a week ago, he said on Monday night. “We are concerned about our ability to assure the continuing provision of any of the key public services we have tried to protect, and education is one of them.”With regard to the reopening of schools Dr Holohan pointed out that Nphet had “never said” that children did not contract Covid-19. “They do get it, they don’t get it to the same extent as the rest of the population.“The work that has been done across schools, to maintain the school environment as a safe place, we can see that in the data. We’re now in a situation, and we have expressed concerns about this, these levels of infections in children of school-going age have increased very significantly, even if they are less than the average rate in the population.”Meanwhile, the president of the Association of Secondary Students in Ireland (ASTI) has said that State exams must go ahead in 2021 “no matter what”.Speaking to Philip Boucher-Hayes on RTÉ Radio One, Ann Piggott said the contents of exam papers may need to be changed because of the current situation, and that if time was needed to catch up teachers would be willing to discuss the matter with the Department of Education.Ms Piggott called for clarity on the reopening of schools as teachers needed time to plan for remote learning and parents needed to make child-minding arrangements.The union was worried about the increasing levels of the virus in the community. At a meeting with the Minister for Education on Monday, Ms Piggott said they were told that schools were “very safe places” and would reopen on Monday next.“I don’t think there’s honesty in facing what’s happening.”On the same programme Dr Gabrielle Colleran, radiology consultant, warned that if schools closed then some frontline workers would have to stay at home to mind their children. She called for childcare to be provided for such workers so they could go to work when the country was facing the worse of the surge.“We don’t have to reinvent the wheel, other countries have done it.”School principal Colm O’Rourke said that within schools “things have improved by 10 years” since this time last year with regard to remote learning. There had been “huge investment” by the Department of Education and schools were now in a better position to provide online teaching, it was the engagement level that was the issue.The shorter the time out of school, the better, he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"About 335,600 people will receive the benefit this weekThe first test is for governments to stop subsidising fossil fuel industry which knowingly contributed to global over-heatingEvery 0.1 degree matters as the world attempts to keep within 1.5-degree rise"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449795.1609774466!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"opw rejects green party idea of lighting phoenix park for joggers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDeer in the Phoenix Park. Photograph: Marc O’SullivanThe Office of Public Works (OPW) has rejected a petition from a Green Party councillor for improved lighting in Dublin’s Phoenix Park, a move that it says would prevent light pollution and disturbance to animals.Chief park superintendent Margaret Gormley said the OPW did not want to encourage people to visit the park at night.Ms Gormley was responding to a request from Green Party councillor Darcy Lonergan who sought better lighting in the park to allow people, particularly women, to exercise there safely at night.However, Ms Gormley said that if people should do so, they should be able to “star-gaze” rather than run.“The Office of Public Works encourages the public to enjoy full amenities and resources of the park, from dawn to dusk,” she said. “We don’t encourage people to go through the park running at night. We’re aware people do, but we don’t endorse that.”Gas lamps were installed in the Phoenix Park in the 1850s. It is one of the last remaining public places in Europe that still relies on gas light, Ms Gormley said.“The decision to preserve these gas lights was made to support the conservation of the historic fabric of the park, but also to retain low lighting levels, ie low levels of light pollution, so the park is a place where people can star-gaze.”She added that the park was a “hugely important” wildlife habitat and supported 50 per cent of the mammal species and 40 per cent of the bird species found in Ireland. The deer were the reason the Phoenix Park existed as it was established as a royal deer park in 1662.“The low lighting levels support the habitat of the deer. Because the deer graze throughout the park at night.”Pollinating speciesArtificial lighting was also having “a very negative impact on nocturnal pollinating species”, she said.Maintaining the current low lighting levels to minimise light pollution was a “specific objective” of the park’s conservation management plan.“Thus the OPW has no plans to install additional lighting within the Phoenix Park at the current time,” Ms Gormley said.Ms Lonergan said she was not necessarily seeking more lighting, but added: “We just want better lighting.”“We also don’t want to light up all the Phoenix Park. This was a safety issue so people around the park can actually exercise after 5pm at night.”She was only asking for “the main strip” of Chesterfield Avenue to be lit up. It was already a busy thoroughfare for cars, “so I don’t think the wildlife would be coming that far in, and if they are they would be used to that type of noise,” she said.“This is about women’s safety, not only about women’s safety, this is about safety. It’s a safety issue people don’t feel safe.”Ms Gormley said the OPW had not been approached by the Garda to say there were any safety issue in the park at night.“People have to make a judgment call of where they go at night. This is not like a public footpath in the city – it’s a park.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4450554.1609852325!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 40 residents and 20 staff infected at laois nursing home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDroimnín Nursing Home detected the first Covid-19 infection on December 29th in a resident who had been discharged from hospital.

The vast majority of the infected residents are not showing symptoms.The nursing home detected the first infection from the virus on December 29th in a resident who had been discharged from hospital.All residents were tested the following day and positive test results were diagnosed among 13 residents on December 31st. The virus has spread significantly to other residents and staff in the past five days.“We are working around the clock to do everything we can to protect the residents and support the staff,” said Gearóíd Brennan, chief executive of Brookhaven. The HSE had provided a couple of staff to cover at the nursing home but Mr Brennan said that the nursing home needed more support from the HSE. “When your staff are sick, that is when you need more staff on, not less,” he said.The nursing home was being supported with staff from within the Brookhaven group but that Droimnín were looking for other staff to help the nursing home during the outbreak. “We are searching all over the place trying to get more staff.

Photograph: Laura HuttonThe acceleration of the Covid-19 vaccination programme should allow people in all 582 nursing homes in the country to be inoculated by the middle of next month, Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) has said.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said on Monday that the programme was being accelerated due to an earlier-than-planned shipment of 35,000 PfizerBioNTech vaccine, an increase from 20,000, that is earmarked for 20 hospitals and 25 nursing homes this week.Mr Donnelly said vaccinations will be increased to 40,000 per week as more supplies become available. HSE chief executive Paul Reid said that doses will be given out seven days a week.Tadhg Daly, chief executive of NHI, said that it was imperative that there would be a seven-day vaccinations in nursing homes “with supply being the only limiting factor.” “We would be hoping for a seven-day roll-out and we would be hoping for all nursing homes to be vaccinated by mid-February,” said Mr Daly.The Minister has said that the Government is planning to have all residents and staff in nursing homes, about 70,000 people, receive their first dose of the two-dose vaccine.Confusion surrounded an apparent delay in the roll-out at two State-run facilities in Dublin, Raheny Community Nursing Unit and Hollybrook Lodge in Inchicore, connected with Beaumont and St James’s hospitals respectively, not receiving vaccines as planned.NHI had been under the impression that both homes would start receiving vaccines on Monday based on a dated schedule of vaccinations released last week by the HSE. Hollybrook said it had never intended to begin its vaccine programme until Tuesday and that a HSE-issued timetable stating Monday was inaccurate. The Raheny home declined to comment as to why it did not proceed but said it intended to do so at some stage later this week. Sage Advocacy, the organisation offering support services for older people, said the apparent delay had prompted large amounts of calls from the public. The HSE said that vaccinations would take place this week in 23 residential care facilities, including seven in Dublin, two in Cavan and two in Tipperary. Sarah Lennon, executive director of Sage Advocacy, said there were some concerns about more Covid-19 outbreaks in nursing homes. “There has been a substantial number of calls through to our phone lines in Sage Advocacy today and hearing that the vaccination programme hasn’t commenced on time will cause some anxiety,” she told RTÉ’s Drivetime programme. “Every day that we miss on the programme is a day really where somebody may be exposed to this quite lethal virus.” Mr Daly said the health service had to “mobilise all resources now” to ensure all nursing homes receive vaccines and the older, vulnerable population are protected in light of the increased risks from records level of infection in circulation.“We find ourselves seeking to navigate a very dangerous juncture,” he said.“Vaccination is in sight for all nursing homes but the multiplying of cases in our communities has a direct consequence for nursing homes, with health experts nationally and internationally stating high-incidence in community has an inevitable impact on nursing homes.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4450007.1609793884!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why is ireland s covid vaccination campaign off to such a slow start","story":"December 29th, 2020: Dublin grandmother Annie Lynch (79) became the first person in the Republic to receive the coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday afternoon.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireWith coronavirus numbers out of control in Ireland and many other countries, there will inevitably be intense focus on progress made by governments in vaccinating their populations against Covid-19.In 12 months’ time, the difference between a slow and a fast rollout of vaccines here will probably be measurable in terms of the loss of hundreds of lives, along with tens of thousands of jobs.So far Ireland has got off to a slow start, leaving the Government and health officials open to accusations of sluggishness and delay. By the end of December one in every 2,500 people had been vaccinated, compared with one in eight in Israel and one in 80 or so in the US and the UK. By that date 1,800 Irish people had been immunised, according to Our World in Data, compared with more than 40,000 in Denmark, a country with a slightly bigger population than our own.The criticisms will only intensify as soaring case numbers heap further pressure on the health service and force much of society to remain shut. The best answer to them is to make serious inroads into vaccinating the population, but this is contingent of there being enough supply.This, in turn, depends on authorisations from EU and Irish regulators, which have tended to lag behind other jurisdictions so far. Another factor is the size of the order made by the EU on behalf of member states for inidual vaccines.It was only after serious pressure from Germany that the European Medicines Agency brought forward its decision last month on the PfizerBionNTech vaccine, and now it is due to make a decision on the Moderna vaccine in the coming days.The agency is not alone among regulators in having issues with the application by OxfordAstra Zeneca for its vaccine, and its requirement for extra data to be provided has pushed back a decision on this until February.Workhorse vaccineThe problem is that this vaccine was conceived as the workhorse of European vaccination programmes, because it is cheap, easy to transport and works in a way similar to existing vaccines, unlike the PfizerBioNTech and Moderna treatments, which use novel technology.The EU went for a strategy of not putting all its eggs in the one basket by placing orders for six different vaccines. It may also, with the benefit of hindsight, have spent too long haggling over price. A number of last year’s likely contenders got delayed, and regulatory decisions moved slowly, leaving the bloc with insufficient orders for the vaccine that was out of the traps first, PfizerBioNTech.As a result, there is little point in the Irish vaccination programme “getting ahead of itself” until a secure and ample pipeline of vaccines comes on stream. Until that happens, we will have to make the best use of what we have. The UK has delayed the second dose of the vaccine so that a greater number can be administered a first dose and so enjoy the partial protection this offers. This approach has split scientific opinion. Even the drug manufacturers are ided, with Pfizer resolutely opposed to any delay in administering a second dose of its vaccine and AstraZeneca more favourably disposed to the idea.For now, this approach has been ruled out in Ireland but another idea we may adopt from the UK is to extract six doses from a vial of PfizerBionNTech vaccine rather than the recommended five. When the right needle is used, the content of the dose can be split six ways, rather than being used five times and leaving some fluid over. This could potentially increase productivity by up to 20 per cent.Who’s the boss?Some countries have decided to start their vaccination programme with working-age adults rather than vulnerable care home residents, but this approach is unlikely to find favour in Ireland.At this point, it is difficult to tell who is running the vaccine rollout programme here. Is it the Department of Health, which has decided the public health response during the pandemic? Or the HSE, which is administering the vaccinations? Or the taskforce that drew up an implementation plan and is still active?While the UK started administering the OxfordAstra Zeneca vaccine at 7.30am on Monday, Irish journalists seeking updates on supplies of the Moderna vaccine here were being referred by the Department of Health to the HSE, and by the HSE to the department. A plan for vaccinations in nursing homes was delayed on Monday, seemingly over consent issues. GPs are still wondering when they and their staff will be immunised.At least Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly was able to announce an increase in this week’s vaccination target from 20,000 to 35,000.None of these early teething issues will matter in the long run, hopefully, but greater clarity would do no harm.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4450030.1609799737!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 schools in north move to remote learning for an extended period","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tArlene Foster said on Monday that the advice was that “we will need to take action and that we’ll need to take action very quickly.”  Photograph: DUPPA WireSchools in the North are to move to remote learning for an “extended period”, the Executive Office announced late last night following an emergency meeting on Monday night. Ministers also agreed that advice on staying at home will be made legally enforceable. Ministers are due to meet again on Tuesday to consider a paper from the Minister for Health which will set out the detail of the proposals, including restrictions on travel, as well as a paper from the Minister for Education. Ealier Northern Ireland’s First Minister has warned the North is in a “very dire situation” and action must be taken “very quickly” to halt the spread of coronavirus. Arlene Foster said on Monday that the advice was that “we will need to take action and that we’ll need to take action very quickly.” She also said discussions would take place with the police “to see what more we can do in relation to enforcement.” At an emergency meeting of the Executive on Monday night as ministers discussed the introduction of further restrictions to limit the spread of coronavirus. Announcing a strict lockdown and the closure of schools in England in a televised address on Monday night, the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said “similar steps” were being taken in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Speaking to reporters before the Executive meeting began, Ms Foster said she did not want to prejudge the discussion but there were “very difficult decisions to take. “I would like to keep schools open for as long as possible but if it is the case that we do need to close schools as we did in March of last year, I will deeply regret that, but we will of course take whatever action is needed based on the medical evidence in front of us,” she said. A further 1,801 people in Northern Ireland tested positive for the virus in the last 24 hours, the North’s Department of Health (DoH) said on Monday, with a total of 12,507 new cases identified in the last seven days. A further 12 people with coronavirus died, bringing the total number of fatalities reported by the Department to 1,366. The meeting of the Northern Executive, which was due to take place on Tuesday, was brought forward because of concerns over the increasing number of cases. The Deputy First Minister, Michelle O’Neill, said the message to stay at home should be put back into law “because that is the only way you can enforce it. We are sitting with an alarming rise in cases,” she said. The North’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr Michael McBride, told the BBC ministers would consider whether more restrictions were needed, but said a “significant” number of restrictions were already in place. “There are not many more restrictions that remain open to us, so it’s a combination of restrictions but also, most importantly of all, following the advice and abiding by those restrictions,” he said. Northern Ireland entered a strict lockdown on St Stephen’s Day which is due to remain in place until at least the end of January. Non-essential retail is closed, and school teaching has been moved online for most pupils for the next week, but there have been increasing calls for schools to be closed for longer, and the transfer test exam, which is due to be sat by some primary school pupils on Saturday, to be cancelled. Dr McBride said the number of cases was “very deeply troubling”, demonstrating that the health service was going to come under “extreme pressures” in the coming weeks. The SDLP has tabled a motion calling for the recall of the North’s Assembly to discuss the increasing number of Covid-19 cases and urging the First and Deputy First Ministers to take “immediate action” and introduce new measures to limit the spread of the virus. Meanwhile, the first doses of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine were administered in Northern Ireland on Monday. The first person in the over-80 category to receive the vaccine was 94-year-old Eileen Lynch, who gave the thumbs up as she was vaccinated by Dr Michael McKenna at her local GP surgery on the Falls Road in west Belfast. Ms Lynch said she was “delighted and privileged” to receive the vaccine and thanked the nurses, doctors and staff who she said had all been “brilliant”.“I feel like I can really look forward to the year ahead now that I have been vaccinated,” she said. A total of 50,000 doses of the vaccine have been made available in the North, with more due to arrive this month. Priority is being given to the over-80s, and it is estimated that all of this age group will have received the vaccine by the end of the month. About 40,000 people have already received the PfizerBioNtech vaccine in Northern Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4450044.1609840433!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shebeen with draught beer and stout on tap is raided by garda%C3%AD","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGardaí raided the premises following a tip-off and on foot of a search warrantGardaí have raided and closed down a fully equipped shebeen in Westport, Co Mayo.

File photograph: Jonathan NackstrandAFP via Getty ImagesMore than two-thirds of the 15 million coronavirus vaccines shipped within the US have gone unused, US health officials said on Monday.In response, the governors of New York and Florida have vowed to penalise hospitals that fail to dispense shots quickly.In New York, hospitals must administer vaccines within a week of receiving them or face a fine and a reduction in future supplies, governor Andrew Cuomo said, hours before announcing the state’s first known case of a new, more infectious coronavirus variant originally detected in Britain.“I don’t want the vaccine in a fridge or a freezer, I want it in somebody’s arm,” the governor said. “If you’re not performing this function, it does raise questions about the operating efficiency of the hospital.”New York hospitals on the whole have dispensed fewer than half of their allocated doses to date, but performance varied from one group of hospitals to another, Mr Cuomo said. The NYC Health + Hospitals system, the city’s main public hospital network, has only administered 31 per cent of its allotment, compared with 99 per cent for a few private hospitals in the state.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an even lower vaccine uptake for New York overall, saying fewer than one in five of the 896,000 doses shipped to the state since mid-December have been given.In Florida, where officials have put senior citizens ahead of many essential workers for getting the vaccine, governor Ron DeSantis announced a policy under which the state would allocate more doses to hospitals that dispense them most quickly.“Hospitals that do not do a good job of getting the vaccine out will have their allocations transferred to hospitals that are doing a good job at getting the vaccine out,” Mr DeSantis said at a briefing.“We do not want vaccine to just be idle at some hospital system,” he added, although he did not say they would face fines.Florida, which has dispensed fewer than a quarter of the 1.14 million doses it has received, according to the CDC, will also deploy an additional 1,000 nurses to administer vaccines and will keep state-run vaccination sites open seven days a week, Mr DeSantis said.Mr Cuomo’s announcement that the more contagious Covid-19 discovered in the UK had been confirmed in a man in his 60s living in a town north of Albany gave new urgency to the state’s efforts to accelerate vaccinations.At least three other US cases of the so-called UK variant have been documented since last week, one each in Florida, California and Colorado. None of the four patients has a recent travel history, meaning the variant was likely spreading person-to-person within each of the communities where it turned up.Neither the UK variant, nor a similarly more contagious strain first found in South Africa, is believed any more lethal than the original form of the virus. Scientists say newly developed vaccines should be equally effective against both.The US death toll has climbed to well over 350,000 out of more than 20 million known infections, with the fatality rate averaging 2,600-plus lives every 24 hours over the past week.The staggering human toll, together with an upending of daily social life and a stifling of economic activity, has made the slower-than-expected uptake of available vaccines all the more vexing to authorities.Medical authorities have confronted widespread distrust of immunisation safety, even among some healthcare workers, owing in part to the record speed with which Covid-19 vaccines were developed and approved 11 months after the virus emerged in the US.But some US officials also have cited organisational glitches in launching the most ambitious mass inoculation campaign in the nation’s history in the year-end holiday season.“The logistics of getting it going into the people who want it is really the issue,” the leading US infectious disease specialist, Dr Anthony Fauci, told MSNBC. “We’re not where we want to be. No doubt about that. I don’t think we can blame it all on vaccine hesitancy.”The federal government has distributed more than 15 million vaccine doses to states and territories across the country, but only about 4.5 million have been administered, the CDC reported.Those figures put the government far short of its goal of vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020, although officials said they expected the rollout would pick up significantly this month. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis south african coronavirus variant worrying","story":"If the coronavirus was a horror film, we have now reached the obligatory ‘not dead yet’ scare, in which the seemingly conquered monster returns from the grave to give a final fright. Just as light was beginning to emerge at the end of a very long and gloomy tunnel, the South African variant of the virus threatens to undermine the vaccine and testing gains of recent months.Brian Pinker, 82, received the first Oxford vaccine on Monday, yet there are real concerns that he and the hundreds of thousands of others who have had their jabs may not be fully protected against this latest mutation.Clearly the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is expecting some vaccine tweaks to be needed as it has already begun to look at how quickly an altered jab could be approved, and Matt Hancock has said he is very worried.The problem lies in how the virus has mutated. Variants of coronavirus have been around since the beginning of the pandemic and are a natural evolutionary process by which viruses adapt to their hosts as they replicate.Most of these mutations have no effect, but occasionally they can improve the ability of the virus to infect or become more resistant to the body’s immune response. This is one such occasion.The South African variant has three mutations in important genes. One, the N501Y mutation, has already been found in the UK variant and could be responsible for it being so infectious.However, the South African version carries two more mutations (E484K and K417N) that are absent in the British version and make it far more worrying. “These two additional mutations may interfere more with vaccine effectiveness in the South African variant than in the UK variant,” said Dr Julian W Tang, honorary associate professor and clinical virologist, University of Leicester.“This does not mean that the existing Covid-19 vaccines will not work at all, just that the antibodies induced by the current vaccines may not bind and neutralise the South African variant as well as it would the other circulating viruses, including the UK variant.”The South African variant carries mutations in a gene which builds spike proteins – the rod-like structures on the outside of the virus which attaches to human cells.Spike proteins are also produced by vaccines so that the body knows what to look for and what to fight off. So, any significant changes to the spike protein may mean the body can no longer spot the virus, even after vaccination or a previous infection, and antibodies produced in anticipation may not be able to attach properly in order to clear it away.Worryingly, the mutations may also mean that it is harder to pick up cases through the normal Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, so it could have already spread widely. It quickly became the dominant variant in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa.Yet there is still hope. Even if the new variant is more infectious, it may not cause more severe disease. England\u0027s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and chief scientific officer, Patrick Vallance, are believed to have briefed Boris Johnson, claiming they are not overly concerned about the new variant.And even if the South African variant becomes more widespread and dominant, both vaccines can be modified to be more effective against this variant in as little as six weeks. Most scientists believe that existing vaccines will still work to some extent, even if the new variant lowers the overall efficacy. The mutations have not altered the shape of the spike protein to such an extent that antibodies cannot bind at all, they just may be less effective. “It is not anticipated that this mutation is sufficient for the ‘South African’ variant to bypass the protection provided by current vaccines,” said Prof Francois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology, University College London (UCL). “It’s possible that new variants will affect the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines, but we shouldn’t make that assumption yet about the South African one.”Researchers are working round the clock to find out just how dangerous this new variant is, and new lockdown measures introduced by the Government will undoubtedly help to stem the tide, and give scientists room to find a new solution.Prof James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, and University of Oxford, said: We can all help if we redouble our efforts to wash our hands, wear a mask and socially distance.

Nothing new there — the NYT has become a running joke on these shores for the standard of its dispatches from Albion. Such is the frequency of the inaccuracies, one might almost think they were deliberate. Perhaps we have brought it on ourselves heaven knows the British harbour unflattering views of the average American, existing on a spectrum somewhere between Homer Simpson and Eric Cartman. But the reasons for the NYT’s slanted view lie very firmly in the past, and its preoccupation with re-writing it to alter the present.It’s not just its dispatches about the UK that the Grey Lady has come under fire for recently — for a paper of record, it has recorded some howlers. The NYT issued one article, following a two month investigation into its award-winning podcast series “Caliphate” stating the paper had “fallen short” of its standards for giving “too much credence” to “false or exaggerated” evidence. Then there was the fallout over a comment piece, written by Republican Senator Tom Cotton, on deploying the US military against protestors over the summer, which led to the resignations of senior editor James Bennet, and star columnist Bari Weiss, the latter claiming she had been the victim of targeted bullying. Staff at the Times had apparently claimed publishing the column represented a physical threat to their wellbeing.Another NYT journalist, Nikole Hannah-Jones, led the charge against the likes of Weiss, and said she was “deeply ashamed” of the paper for publishing the Cotton op-ed. But Hannah-Jones, too, has been at the centre of fierce criticism as the architect of the paper’s feted 1619 Project (for which she won a Pulitzer Prize last year), the stated aim of which is to “reframe the country’s history by placing the consequences of slavery … at the very center of the national narrative.”Despite the accolades, the project has come in for intense scrutiny from an array of commentators and historians, amid claims it promotes factual inaccuracies to push an ideological agenda. The NYT initially defended it before later issuing several corrections — but it is through this last story that we can begin to understand the paper’s continued misreporting of life the other side of the pond. Americans tend to view Britain as a quaint place at best where everyone is either a cockney, an unemployed miner or a public school boy, where the food is bad, the teeth are worse, and we yearn for the days of red-coated flag-waving empire. For that last thing in particular, you can see why a certain animosity might exist at a newspaper bent on pushing a rewriting of history based on the transatlantic slave trade and historical injustice. Britain is the old colonial master — the birth place of the tyranny from which the patriots fought to free themselves, and the nation that brought liberal east coast America’s modern notion of evil “whiteness” to the continent. If slavery is America’s original sin (with an uncomfortable shuffle over questions on the fate of the natives) Britain is the serpent that despoiled this once tranquil Eden. Nor should we discount the fact that the NYT, based where it is, panders first to a community with deep Irish migrant roots, often away from the mismanagement and subjugation of their homeland by the British. All forms of Republican culture, from the country club sets and Ivy League networks to white trash and rednecks, are seen as Anglo-Saxon in heritage. Even the country’s hard Christian streak is typified by the arrival of the Puritan pilgrims aboard the Mayflower — so English that they broke with the Church of England for being a little too Roman Catholic for their liking. Britain, and specifically England, then, must forever be seen through this prism, as the backwards desolation America must leave behind - more a Troy to these Romans than a Greece. Combine that with the lazy comparisons between the Maga movement and Brexit, and the tenuous similarities between Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, and their fates, and you get the full package: America endured Trump and overcame, while backwards old Britain is stuck with Boris and Brexit. Not just a warning from history, but a live action alternative of how much worse things could be. If that is the fantasy world the paper wishes to inhabit, so be it. From afar, we have already seen what isive and delusional outcomes framing stories to suit your beliefs has brought to America in the past few years. Britain too has indulged in its fair share. But let us not pretend that it is anything other than fantasy, regardless of whether it’s a “paper of record” peddling it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"georgia run offs democratic odd couple carry joe bidens hopes","story":"The sky was pure blue and the trees heavy with Spanish moss on Sunday lunchtime when Jon Ossoff took the microphone in a park on the outskirts of Savannah, Georgia.“Y’all, Tuesday is it,” said the 33-year-old Democratic candidate for the US Senate, tie-less in a blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up. “Tuesday is everything.”Around 200 supporters had turned out, above expectations. Some muttered “yes sir” and “preach it” as Mr Ossoff’s stump speech outlined what was on the line.“The whole country is watching us right now,” he said. “The whole country is watching Georgia to see what kind of a statement we’re going to make about the values that we stand for, about what\u0027s in our hearts as a state and as a people.”He was not wrong. Across the rest of America, the US election - which happened two months ago - is already fading into the past along with the rest of 2020. But not in Georgia.Thanks to the quirks of the state’s electoral system, the occupants of its two US Senate seats will be decided on Tuesday after ‘run-offs’ were ordered when no candidate got more than 50 per cent of the vote in November.Hanging in the balance is not just state power, however, but control of the Senate. Currently the Republicans hold 50 seats and the Democrats 48 with these two races outstanding.Win both and the Democrats pull equal, with Kamala Harris, the incoming US vice president, casting the deciding vote - allowing them to control proceedings. Lose just one and the Republicans keep their majority and ability to veto measures.US president-elect Joe Biden’s legislative agenda is on the line.Those watching Mr Ossoff in the Savannah sun were pulling out all the stops to flip the seats in the Democrats\u0027 favour. Sam Gostomski, a 24-year-old volunteer checking the temperatures of attendees as a coronavirus safety precaution, had travelled all the way from Austin to help out.He was among a group of 25 young Texans who upped sticks to Georgia on Boxing Day to knock doors and help run events. Most had worked on the Biden campaign and saw the state as unfinished business.“All of that work doesn’t mean as much if we don’t take the Senate and get some reforms passed,” Mr Gostomski said. “It’s not an exaggeration to say this is the most important race in America right now.Mr Ossoff is a documentary filmmaker who shot to prominence in 2017 by almost winning a House of Representatives seat in Georgia and packs his speeches with lofty appeals to the greater good.He has a youthful exuberance similar to Beto O\u0027Rourke, the ex-Texas congressman who ran for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination.The Democrat seeking the other Georgia seat, Rev Raphael Warnock, is quite different. A 51-year-old African-American, he was the pastor at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church - famous for once being Martin Luther King\u0027s congregation - before turning to politics.Rev Warnock’s addresses have the ring of the pulpit. Speaking at a drive-in rally also in Savannah on Sunday - his hometown - he referenced his spiritual upbringing while taking aim at his Republican opponent Kelly Loeffler, 50. “She’s been busy, as we say in church, calling me everything but a child of God. Lying on me, misrepresenting my record. We say in church, scandalising my name,” Rev Warnock said.“But that’s alright. My mumma told me that it’s not what they call you, it’s what you answer to. And in just a few days she can call me Senator Raphael Warnock.”They make an odd couple, these two politicians who carry Mr Biden\u0027s hopes of passing bold new left-wing laws. “My brother from another mother” is how Rev Warnock refers to Mr Ossoff. They also represent two cornerstones of the Democratic Party\u0027s support base: young progressives and African-Americans.To win, supporters and politicians on both sides agree, the Democrats need vast turnout. They did just that in November, registering scores of new voters - many African-American - and making Mr Biden the first Democratic presidential nominee to win Georgia since 1992.The signs are encouraging. Early voting, which tends to favour the Left, has been high. Polling averages suggest both Democrats lead by around two percentage points.Donations have poured into the state, with Mr Ossoff and Rev Warnock each raising more than $100 million, making them the best-funded Senate candidates in US history - though their rivals are close behind.But Republicans, who have dominated politics in the southern state for decades, remain hopeful. They believe the chance to rob Mr Biden of Senate power will reinvigorate conservatives eager to block progressive causes.Ms Loeffler, who is married to the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange and estimated to be the richest US senator, dubbed her opponent Rev Warnock a “radical liberal” 13 times during a recent debate, summarising the key Republican attack line. Campaign adverts have dredged up controversial comments Rev Warnock made while preaching, framing him as anti-America. He in turn released a smiley ad of himself walking a puppy and while wearing a gilet to allay fears. It has been viewed 6 million times online. Mr Ossoff’s opponent, the 71-year-old incumbent Republican David Perdue, took a different track. He has attempted to ignore his young opponent, even refusing to debate him - leaving the Democrat free to answer questions next to an empty podium.The election\u0027s biggest unknown factor comes thanks to Donald Trump, who like Mr Biden was due to campaign in the state on Monday. His repeated insistence without evidence that mass fraud robbed him of election victory threatens to deter Republicans from voting.Furthermore he has gone to war with leading Georgia Republicans who have refused to meddle with vote counts to overturn Mr Biden’s win, most recently calling the Georgia secretary of state for an hour to demand action. The leaked audio triggered a new scandal.The political danger was evident on Sunday afternoon as around 50 Republicans gathered amid $50 cushions and wooden carved crosses at a boutique furniture store in downtown Savannah for a pre-vote pep talk.Tim Scott, the Republican senator from nearby South Carolina, praised the virtues of a sign he had seen in the Peach State which declared “pick peaches, not socialism”, hammering home the party’s main message while not mentioning claims of voter fraud.Both for some attendees that issue was front and centre. Melynda Loomis, the 52-year-old treasurer of the local Republican branch wearing a bright red MAGA face mask and a Trump Deplorable badge, expressed concern. “I’m terrified,” she said of the outcome of Tuesday\u0027s vote.Asked if the result will be close, she echoed Mr Trump’s unproven allegations: “It won’t be if you could only count the humans that are alive, but there are all the ballots from dead people.”Ms Loomis went one step further - she knows Republicans who will not vote in the run-off after losing faith with US democracy. “They don’t believe it anymore and that’s sad, she said. They don’t think their vote counts.If many others follow suit, Mr Trump’s last month in office could deliver a final irony: in pursuing claims of election fraud so relentlessly he could hand the Senate to the man who defeated him. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Travel latest news: Arrivals may need negative Covid test to enter UKPolitics latest news: \u0026#39Absent\u0026#39 Rishi Sunak under pressure over gaps in lockdown support Scotland lockdown: what are the new Covid rules and Tier 4 restrictions?Coronavirus latest news: Lockdown may not be enough to stop virus, Sage member warnsComment: Even the vaccine rollout has become a battleground for culture warriorsTeachers’ predicted grades likely to replace A-levels and GCSEs as exams are ruled outLockdown 1, 2 and 3: What are the differences, and what are you unable to do? readers on the vaccine priority list: \u0026#39Teachers before the elderly\u0026#39Analysis: why the South African coronavirus variant is so worryingWhat England\u0026#39s new national lockdown rules mean for youAustralian advert featuring man eating a \u0026#39bat sandwich\u0026#39 investigatedJapan appeals to student nurses to fill gaps on hospital wardsWhat are the rules for non-essential shops in lockdown?Schools to close in new Covid lockdown: latest news on when they could reopenCan I meet my friends outside?

I don\u0027t think that refugees would be treated like this.She said she was kept outside for an hour in -3C temperatures, left to sleep in a bare lounge, and denied food or bottled water for five hours.Border guards also rummaged through her luggage, she added. I said, \u0027why are you doing this?\u0027 And they said, \u0027because you\u0027re like every other country now - like Turkey\u0027.When the plane landed, only Swedish citizens were allowed to leave their seats, she said. Citizens of other countries were told they could only enter Sweden if they could show a negative coronavirus test less than 72 hours old from the UK\u0027s list of authorised providers.While most of those travelling had been aware of the PCR requirement, all were unaware it had to be from a specific provider - information that she said had been on neither the British embassy\u0027s website, nor on that of the Swedish police.Miss Smart, who is in the process of applying for Swedish residency, estimated that about 12 people\u0027s tests were rejected, of which around six agreed to stay on the plane and return to Manchester.The rest were then left to stand outside for more than an hour in temperatures of around -3C, she said.From the offset we were treated incredibly poorly, said British citizen Lauren Braithewaite, 32, who is also applying for Swedish residency. It felt like the police were using tactics to break us so we would give in and agree to taking a flight back to the UK.At 9pm, three British citizens, a Norwegian citizen and a Cypriot woman were admitted to a disused lounge, while a British couple and their two-year-old daughter were taken elsewhere.The five kept in the lounge had to wait five hours before they were offered food, and were initially given only cold water with which to make tea, which they had to microwave.It was just really demoralising, they were just completely trying their best to make me feel low, degrade me, just to make it really clear that I was from a \u0027third country\u0027, Miss Smart said.  At 12pm on Monday, Miss Braithewaite and another woman were allowed to leave when the Swedish authorities decided to accept their PCR test, which had been carried out by the National Health Service.By 6pm on Monday, Miss Smart was still waiting to see if her negative PCR test, given by a private company not included on the list of authorised providers, would be enough for her to gain entry. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph readers vaccine priority list teachers elderly","story":"All schools are to close as part of a strict lockdown, Boris Johnson announced on Monday night. The stricter measures are designed to contain the new coronavirus strain while the NHS works on a timetable to vaccinate all over-70s, health workers, care home residents and clinically vulnerable people. In an effort to reopen schools, a former Conservative education secretary as well as NASUWT, the teaching union, has called for teachers and dinner ladies to be prioritised for the coronavirus vaccine. Two  writers, Ross Clark and Calvin Robinson, debated whether teachers should be moved to the front of the vaccine queue and now  readers have had their say. Read on to find out whether your fellow readers think teachers should be prioritised for jabs and share your view in the comments section below.Vaccinate nurses, care home workers and all teachers over 50 as a priority. Then the doctors and extremely vulnerable, and then, and only then, the elderly.The sickly sentimental focus on the very aged has been an unedifying and distorting sham to conceal our disregard for all other interest and age groups.Other key workers should be offered a vaccine: medical staff dealing with Covid, supermarket workers, transport industry workers and power industry workers, for instance.We need a two-pronged attack here, the elderly and vulnerable and key workers essential to the operation of the country.The vulnerable have been dying in their thousands. How many teachers have died of Covid in the past year?I can see little justification for vaccinating teachers ahead of the vulnerable.It is laughable that this is even being debated.Teachers should be vaccinated in the first round to get children back into school. It is essential our children continue their education.You then also take away any excuses teachers have for staying away.Give all school staff the Oxford jab at the same time then all the schools can reopen in February. The kids go back to school, work hard to catch-up, and their parents can go back to work.All this talk  is boring and wasteful.Yes, with the teachers vaccinated, the kids wearing masks and continuing to practice social distancing, the schools can open, parents can go back to work (again continuing with health mandates) and some normality can return. Surely the teachers won\u0027t be able to continue to maintain it is not safe?With kids, even if they get the virus, not being badly affected, why should they not be at school?  They appear to be everywhere else playing, meeting friends and playing sports. If, after being vaccinated, teachers won\u0027t return to school, they should be fired.Why are you even asking that question? Teachers, NHS staff and care workers should have been first, even ahead of the very elderly.My parents didn’t need it first. Living a careful life in Cornwall, they would have been happy to wait.Anyone in a people-facing industry should be a priority. Yes, as part of the keyworker group as they are keyworkers. Children\u0027s education is important, and a lot of parents work – so keeping schools open requires vaccinated teachesrs.You know it makes sense.Teachers have gained unprecedented self-importance. The final shame would be if teachers take away vaccines from vulnerable people, elderly and key workers on the front line.All frontline workers, over 50, with pre-existing conditions, as well as BAME workers with health issues in key posts, should have priority. Why should these important workers be sacrificed and isolated?At the end of last term, Covid swept through my son’s primary school. It was frightening the speed at which it moved.Eventually, all children ended up in isolation, along with staff. It lasted for three weeks and then term ended – who knows how long the cycle would have endured had it not been for the end of term.If everyone is isolating then children aren’t at school. If they’re not at school they aren’t being educated. Vulnerable children are at greater risk. Some are not fed.Vaccinating teachers isn’t about the unions it’s about child welfare.I don\u0027t think teachers should be prioritised for the vaccine, because it\u0027s not going to make any difference with the forthcoming lockdown. Instead, I think the government should be bending over backwards to make sure they provide laptops to all underprivileged children.Calvin Robinson notes that the teacher unions appeared initially to oppose online learning, but he doesn\u0027t criticise the government for failing to provide laptops for these children.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mum two turns baby box","story":"AdvertorialMum-of-two turns baby box hobby into booming business during the pandemicSophie Lytton creates special sensory boxes for babies and has been able to grow her idea thanks to Clarion FuturesmirrorShareByDave Masters:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC AdvertorialSophie got the idea after taking her son to sensory classesWhen juggling work and a young family became too much for Sophie Lytton, she decided to step back from her role as a primary school teacher. And that’s when Clarion Futures helped her to turn her hobby into a thriving business. “Without the encouragement and support of Clarion Futures I may well have given up,” says Sophie, “but they gave me confidence in my business and my product, and with their help I was able to develop it and grow it quickly.” Clarion Futures is the charitable foundation of Clarion Housing Group, the largest social landlord in the country. The foundation runs one of the largest programmes of its kind in the UK, giving people access to everything from employment and financial support through to youth and community programmes. One of the areas it focuses on is jobs and training, providing free tailored support to help people find and sustain employment, develop their skills or start their own business, through the pandemic and beyond. The aim is to help more people like Sophie.  The -year-old mum of two from Suffolk explains: “I still work as a supply teacher, and I love the job, but when I went back to work full-time after my little boy was born I was struggling. I was spending time away from my family and it was having a big effect on my mental health. “My husband encouraged me to take time away.”  That’s when Sophie turned her thoughts to the special sensory boxes she loved to create: “Me and my little boy went to baby sensory classes, he loved them and I could see how they were helping him to develop. I had a dficult birth and they really helped us to bond. “When I went back to work and couldn’t go to classes I looked at buying single items like foil blankets and baby maracas, but they were so expensive I decided to make my own sensory boxes and gave them to family and friends to try. The feedback was brilliant. My sensory boxes provide everything parents need to create stimulating sensory play at home with their little ones.”A friend suggested she contact Clarion Futures about turning her hobby into a business, and A Sense of Wonder was born. GO VIRTUAL. Many employers are now conducting interviews remotely, so learning how to use s like Microsoft Teams, Zoom or Skype will boost your chances of success. ASK FOR HELP. Overcoming barriers to work can be daunting and scary. Speak to someone with the appropriate knowledge to help you plan a way to move forward and consider training opportunities to meet your goal. Let friends and family know you’re looking for work and network, too, to widen your reach in the job market.  BROADEN YOUR HORIZONS. When looking for work, focus on the core skills you have that you can transfer to dferent types of roles, rather than looking for specic job titles. Everyone has unique selling points and transferable skills – the trick is to highlight what they are and how you will use them to match what the employer wants.  FIND WAYS TO STAND OUT. Carefully tailoring your talents to the job description, doing some research and paying attention to details such as spelling, grammar and formatting can be the dference between an interview offer and a rejection. A thoughtfully prepared application shows you are genuinely interested in the role and helps the employer see that you could be a great fit. MAKE A PLAN AND LOOK AFTER YOURSELF. Healthy job hunting habits can help you stay on track. Create a plan and dedicate some time each day to job searches and applications but make sure you take breaks – it’ll help you to feel less anxious about finding work and renew your focus and energy.For more about the support available to people in England visit Clarion Futures here, or check out advice for jobseekers provided by Job Centre Plus here.Sophie says: “My Clarion Futures adviser, Rumana, helped me think everything through from building my social media presence and developing my website to helping me sort out my finances and secure a grant to pay for advertising.“She even suggested sending the boxes to celebrities with young children to help raise the profile of my business which has worked really well, with one or two taking to Instagram to share what they thought.“Throughout lockdown the support was still there, through email, phone calls and FaceTime. I’m now increasing my product range including Christmas boxes, and developing boxes for older children with autism and ADHD, and people with dementia.” Between April  and April , Clarion Futures supported , people into work, placed  people into apprenticeships and helped  people to start their own business.   "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus lockdown shielding full list","story":"NewsCoronavirus lockdown shielding: Full list of vulnerable people told to stay at homeMillions deemed deemed clinically extremely vulnerable could be forced to shield at home for months as a senior cabinet minister admits this Covid- lockdown could drag on into MarchmirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video michael-gove-says-government-hopes-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

The guidance was already in place for Tier  areas and it could remain for months after Michael Gove admitted this shutdown - triggered by a new, more infectious iant of Covid- - could drag on into March.New shielding letters are to be sent to those deemed clinically extremely vulnerable, defined by the NHS as those at high risk from the virus. The latest Government guidance, yet to be updated following Monday nightaposs lockdown announcement, says people who are extremely vulnerable should no longer attend work, school, college or university. They should only go out for medical appointments, exercise or another essential reason. The group includes those with reduced immune systems, specic cancers or severe respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma, adults with Downaposs syndrome, and pregnant women with signicant heart disease. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. Data from NHS Digital last month suggested there were more than . million shielded patients in England - almost % of the population. Those who are clinically vulnerable are being told they should not go out to the shops, pharmacies or work, eventhey are unable to work from home. They should avoid all non-essential travel. It is not known how long the guidance will be in place. This is similar to the advice in November. The measures mark a slight relaxation from last spring, when shielding patients were told to stay at home at all times and medical appointments were advised to be done at home.What do you think of the shielding guidance  Let us know in the comments sectionWho is considered extremely vulnerable  The clinically extremely vulnerable group includes people whose immune systems are suppressed or who suffer specic conditions. The conditions include specic cancers or severe respiratory conditions, such as cystic fibrosis. There are two ways people may be identied as clinically extremely vulnerable - they fall into the list below, or their GP has added them to the shielded patient list. As he announced the lockdown on Monday night, Boris Johnson said: If you are clinically extremely vulnerable, we are advising you to begin shielding again and you will shortly receive a letter about what this means for you.  Those with the following conditions fall into the clinically extremely vulnerable group: - Solid organ transplant recipients.- People with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy.- Lung cancer patients who are undergoing radical radiotherapy. - People with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment. - Those having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for cancer. - People having other targeted cancer treatments that can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors. - Those who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last six months or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs. - Patients with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . - People with rare diseases that signicantly increase the risk of infections , homozygous sickle cell. -People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to signicantly increase risk of infection. - Problems with your spleen, for example splenectomy- Adults with Downaposs syndrome. - Adults on dialysis or with chronic kidney disease . - Women who are pregnant with signicant heart disease, congenital or acquired. - Other people who have also been classed as clinically extremely vulnerable, based on clinical judgement and an assessment of their needs Anyone in the clinically extremely vulnerable group will have previously had a letter earlier in the pandemic from the NHS or their GP informing them of their status. What does the guidance say  Socialising Stay at home as much as possible, except to go outdoors to exercise or attend health appointments. Try to keep all contact with others outside of your household to a minimum, and avoid busy areas. You can still remain in your support bubble and receive informal care at home from people within your support bubble. As well, you can still receive care at home from professional social care and medical professionals. But you cannot meet with friends and family you do not live with unless they are part of your support bubble, according to the guidance. Try to stay two metres away from other people within your household. Going outside Avoid all non-essential travel, but continue to travel to hospital and GP appointments as required unless told otherwise by their doctor. Those who are extremely vulnerable are strongly advised not to go to any shops or to pharmacies, and government support is available for those who need it while they remain at home.

Mr Gove told Sky News: “The Education Secretary has been talking to the exams regulator Ofqual in order that we can find a way of recognising the immense hard work that students across the country have put in this year. “Obviously we can’t have A-levels, GCSEs or BTECs in the way that we have had them in the past but there are ways of ensuring that we can assess the work that students have done, give them a fair recognition of that and help them onto the next stage of their education. “The Education Secretary will be saying more about that but it is critically important that parents and students recognise that their work will be recognised at the end of this year – it is not the case that anyone would, or anyone would want to, down tools as it were. “It is critically important that children maintain their learning and we will be supporting them to do so by making it easier for more and more students to access remote learning.” Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said there is still “wriggle room” to make modications to exams. He told BBC Breakfast: “I think what will happen with the Prime Minister’s announcement is people will have heard what people wanted to hear. “What I heard was it would not be fair to continue with the current arrangements. “I am sure what that did was give some wriggle room to say that maybe all exams couldn’t run, that would be unthinkable, but maybe there could be some modication to exams.” Mr Barton, said it seems “impossible” that BTEC exams can go ahead. He said: “Well, the Government says they are happening. The trouble is that,you were listening to the Prime Minister’s speech, you wouldn’t know that and there might be lots of young people therefore who are assuming they should be following the advice and not going to college.

The controversial Leader of the Commons was spotted ignoring his own Government’s guidance not to travel between tiers on Sunday. He was seen attending St Mary’s catholic church in Glastonbury, Somerset, which is in Tier  and fteen miles from his posh manor house home in West Harptree, which is in Tier . While people are allowed to attend church in Tier  areas the Government’s own guidance is that people should not travel from one tier to another and keep social contact to a minimum. Writer Liz Williams, , from Glastonbury was told Jacob Rees-Mogg visited town to attend the Latin mass conducted on Sunday. She told The Mirror: “A number of people are very cross about this, while not as egregious as what Dominic Cummings did, he is still crossing from tier  to tier  just to go to mass, which we are told not to do. “I think the anger in town is the fact that not only is this not essential, even though he may argue dferently as a Christian, but that he is actually a member of the Government that is setting this policy. “It just seems yet again like there is one rule for us and one rule for the rest of them. “Look I am not a Christian, I am not a Tory, I am just a normal upstanding member of the community who is fed up of this hypocritical approach from the people that are setting these rules.” Father Bede Rowe, of St Marys church, confirmed to The Mirror that Jacob Rees-Mogg attended the afternoon Latin mass at there on Sunday. When askedhe saw Jacob Rees-Mogg at the holy ceremony on he simply said “yes” but refused to be drawn on whether it was appropriate for the politician to have crossed tiers to attend the service and said he did not speak to him. He said: “We are not allowed to speak to people before or after mass due to the Diocesan guidelines. “All I know is that our churches are open and people can come to mass, you would have to speak to himabout this.” Another Glastonbury resident, who says he has attended services with Rees-Mogg at the church in the past but does not want to be named, said: “He is not there every week, but it is a very nice environment to be in.  “The priests there, who are also Benedictine monks, have set-up this kind of little mystic order and they are using all these old kinds of worship that dates from before the Reformation using Latin and the Latin mass that they are doing in there is the thing that has apparently attracted Mogg. “But does the Leader of the House of Commons really need to cross tiers to go to a Latin mass though  “I don’t know why he would have chosen to be there on Sunday, I don’t know why he considered it important enough to completely ignore all the guidance his own people are putting out there. “Recently we had a lot of revellers in town during the Winter Solstice and they raised a lot of eyebrows and got a lot of hostility because they were ignoring the regulations and the bottom line is people are responding the same to him on this as they did with them.” "},{"url":null,"title":"keeping nurseries open lockdown been","story":"NewsKeeping nurseries open in lockdown may have been political decision, says SAGE expertNursery leaders call for reassurance amid fear and confusion over safety of allowing early years settings to operatemirrorShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN News \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Virologist Professor Calum Semple said it was vitally important to close all non-essential activities as infection rates soar - and claimed allowing nurseries to operate had not been a scientic decision. Nursery leaders warned of fear and confusion over how safe the settings were and said parents needed reassurance from Government. It comes as Boris Johnson ordered schools and colleges in England to close from Tuesday except for vulnerable children and key workersapos kids as part of the third national lockdown. Pupils will move to remote education until mid-February when the lockdown rules are due to be reviewed. But early years settings, such as nurseries and child minders, will still be allowed to operate, and existing childcare bubbles can continue. Prof Semple suggested restricting nursery capacity to the children of key workers. He told BBC Breakfast: Soa political decision has been made here to keep nurseries open in order to keep the essential staff at work, then that could be tempered by restricting the nursery capacity to those essential workers. Butweaposve got to the point of closing the universities, secondary schools and primary schools on the grounds of public health, then I would be looking to close all other non-essential activities. And it may be that a political decision has been made here that nurseries are essential. But itaposs not a scientic one. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of National Day Nurseries Association , said parents, nurseries and staff were worried. She said: Nurseries want to keep open so they can continue to support children and give them a safe and nurturing place during this lockdown. However, the Government are asking a lot of childcare providers and their staff and have to recognise this."},{"url":null,"title":"new lockdown rules last until","story":"NewsNew lockdown rules may last until March not February, Michael Gove admitsWhen Boris Johnson announced the lockdown last night he had suggested it could end as early as February , but that date appeared to change this morning.mirrorShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video michael-gove-says-government-hopes-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

When Boris Johnson announced the lockdown last night he had suggested it could end as early as February , but that date appeared to change this morning.Speaking on Sky News, Mr Gove warned that the country was in for a “very dficult” few weeks and could give no firm date for lting the lockdown. He told Sky News: “The Government is doing everything it can in order to ensure that we can roll out the vaccine more rapidly, help the vulnerable by getting the inoculations they need and make sure that at the end of what will inevitably be very, very dficult weeks, that le can eventuallyto normal.” Pressed on whether the lockdown was likely to last until March, Mr Gove added: “We will be able to review the progress that we’ve made on February , just before the traditional school half-term, and we hope that we will be able to progressively lt restrictions after that but what I can’t do is predict – nobody can predict – with accuracy exactly what we will be able to relax and when. “What we do know is that the more effective our vaccination programme, the more people who are protected in that way, the easier it will be to lt these restrictions.” He added: I think it’s right to say that as we enter March, we should be able to lt some of these restrictions but not necessarily all.Mr Gove confirmed that Chancellor Rishi Sunak will also unveil support packages for businesses later today. Last night, Mr Johnson shut schools to most pupils and imposed the toughest restrictions since March in an attempt to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed by surging coronavirus infections.In a televised address to the nation on Monday evening, the Prime Minister pinned hopes on the rollout of vaccines to ease the restrictions in mid-February.  He ordered the country to stay indoors other than for limited exceptions and bowed to signicant pressure to order primary schools, secondaries and colleges to move to remote teaching for the majority of students from Tuesday. His move followed Nicola Sturgeon imposing a lockdown on Scotland for the rest of January, with a legal requirement to stay at home and schools closed to most pupils until February. Schools and colleges in Wales will also remain closed until at least January  and move to online learning, while in Northern Ireland – which is already under a six-week lockdown – “stay at home” restrictions will be brought back into law and a period of remote learning for schoolchildren is to be extended. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:true,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,tcfVersion:,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,codesplit:,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,loginRadiusAPIKey:d-da-d--ccee,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,delayAdsUntilConsented:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,loginRadius:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,prebid.sendHBKeys:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,enableUserProfile:true,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,smartAdServerDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,verizonDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,enableAboutTopics:true,GDPRConsentEnabled:,viafouraComments:true,swipeNavigation:true,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,fundingChoicesEnabled:true,customAdExperience:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,LoginRadiusDomain:https:reachplc.hub.loginradius,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,ixDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,commentCountEnabled:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,video.suppressDates:true,delayVideoAdsUntilConsented:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true\" In a bleak statement, Mr Johnson said the new iant of coronavirus, which is up to % more transmissible, was spreading in a “frustrating and alarming” manner and warned that the number of Covid- patients in English hospitals is % higher than the first peak. “The weeks ahead will be the hardest yet but I really do believe that we’re entering the last phase of the struggle, because with every jab that goes into our arms we’re tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people,” the Prime Minister said. He said people in the top four priority groups would be offered a first vaccine dose by mid-February “ things go well and with a fair wind in our sails”, to allow restrictions to be eased.

All schools must shut until at least the February half-term and you must stay at home except for five specic reasons. Shielding will resume and all pubs must shut - with takeaway pints banned. Boris Johnson gave a TV address after , people tested on a single day - December  - came back positive.England has , patients in hospital, % more than during the first peak of the virus in April, as a new iant rips through the nation. And the case rate in England up to December  was over  per , - three times the . on December . The lockdown will begin tonight but only actually begin in law as soon as possible - probably tomorrow or the next day. People and businesses are being asked to follow the rules from now, even before they become law. How will the new lockdown affect you  Have your say in the comments below. The new lockdown applies across the whole of England, even the Scilly Isles which had been in Tier . There is no set end date, but it will be reviewed by February . People who have been vaccinated will not be exempt from any lockdown rules. MPs will get a vote on the new measures when parliament is recalled on Wednesday. There is likely to be fury at the PM for delaying over precious days after he knew the new iant was spreading through society. The lockdown is more similar to the first one in March than the most recent in November but there are subtle dferences. Here are the new rules that have been announced and what they mean for you. Full details are also published on gov.uk here. aposStay at homeapos order  There will be a very firm “stay at home” message similar to the March lockdown - and effective immediately. You may leave home for one of these five specic reasonable excuses:To go to work or volunteerit’s impossible to do so from home, e.g. a construction or critical worker who can’t work from home. To shop for necessities including food and medicine. To exercise, which can be with your household or up to one other person from outside your household or bubble. The exercise should ideally be limited to once per day. Guidance is that people should try to do this locally. To provide care or help to a vulnerable person. This includes buying food or medicine for a disabled person or someone self-isolating. To attend medical appointments or seek medical care or fleeing the threat of harm or violence.There are other aposreasonable excusesapos on top of these main five ones. You may also leave home for education and registered childcare,your children are eligible to attend despite closures. You may also leave home to be with your childcare or support bubble,you have one, but you are advised to keep it local. You can also leave home to:provide emergency assistance be with someone giving birth visit someone who is dying visit a care home, hospital or hospice resident fulfil animal welfare reasons including going to a vet attend a support groupattend communal worship or le events such as weddings and funerals fulfil a legal obligation carry out activity related to buying, selling, letting or renting a property fulfil respite care where that care is being provided to a vulnerable person or a person with a disability, or is a short break in respect of a looked-after child.Police will have legal powers to enforce through fines and dispersing orders. Fines will stay at their current level of £ for a first offence. Schools, education and childcare  All primary schools, secondary schools and colleges will shut to almost all pupils from tomorrow. Only children of key workers and vulnerable kids can attend in person. Others will learn remotely. This is in line with the March lockdown and much stricter than the November lockdown. There will be a system to get free school meals to eligible kids but it hasn’t been announced or rolled out yet. BTec exams will go ahead this week but GCSEs and A-levels this summer are unlikely to proceed as planned. Boris Johnson said: We recognise that this will mean it is not possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this summer as normal. The Education Secretary will work with Ofqual to put in place alternative arrangements. Thereaposs no current plan announced to hand out more laptops to disadvantaged children, but itaposs something ministers are looking at.Early years such as nurseries alternative provision and special schools remain open in the lockdown. Nursery age, vulnerable kids and kids of critical workers over  can still attend childcare. University students will not be able toand will be expected to study from their current residence where possible until at least mid February. In person teaching at university will only be allowed for a small number of critical courses previously announced such as those studying to work in the health service. Meeting friends and family  You cannot meet people from outside your household or bubble anywhere - indoors or outdoors. The only exemption is that one person can take exercise outside with one person from another household. But you cannot sit down and have a drink together in the park, as you could previously under Tier . You also canapost do anything that counts as recreation and leisure with them, which was allowed under the November lockdown. When you do meet one person from outside your household, you should stay two metres apart, orthataposs not possible, one metre with extra precautions. Under Tier , children under  or certain adults with care needs didn’t count towards that two-person limit. It’s not fully clear yetthat rule has survived into the full lockdown. Boris Johnson saidpeople were shielding before, they must begin shielding again. They will receive inidual letters shortly. However, itaposs thought that, practically, rules for the million-plus previous shielders remain as they currently are in Tier . The ‘clinically extremely vulnerable’ should stay at home as much as possible and should only leave for exercise and health appointments. They should not go to work eventhey cannot work from home, and avoid busy places including shops and pharmacies. But there is not a special support or food parcel package like there was in March. Contrary to reports, the shielding group is not being expanded to include blanket groups such as the over-s. Support bubbles  Support and childcare bubbles will remain as they currently are under the new lockdown. Support bubbles allow a single-adult household, or a couple with a child under one, to permanently ‘bubble up’ with one other household of any size. They can act as though they’re in the same household. A childcare bubble is where one household links with one other household to provide informal childcare - unpaid and unregistered - to anyone under .Children of orced parentsChildren of orced or separated parents can continue to move freely between both parents’ homes, as in previous lockdowns. Furlough  There is no change to furlough in today’s announcement. Employees not at work can be paid % of their usual salary up to a cap of £, a month, funded by the government. It applies to anyone who was employed on October  last year. The furlough scheme has been extended several times and currently expires on April . Parents who can be at work themselves, but have kids out of school, can be furloughed but that’s up to the employer. Unions have called for firms to “do the right thing and support parents” who can’t work due to childcare responsibilities. All non-essential shops shut  All non essential retail, hospitality and personal care services must shutnot already, and remain closed. Essential retailers which include supermarkets, pharmacies, garden centres, and buildersapos merchants may stay open. Non-essential retail stores that must shut include: clothing and homeware stores, vehicle showroomsbetting shops tailors tobacco and vape shops electronic goods and mobile phone shops auction housesmarket stalls selling non-essential goods.All pubs, cafes and restaurants shut - and takeaway pints banned  Restaurants, cafes, pubs and other hospitality venues must shut. They can continue doing delivery or takeaway - but only for food. Takeaway pints will no longer be allowed from pubs.

So she decided to treat herself on her th birthday, booking a two-night solo staycation half an hour up the road from her Florida home. It was the first time sheaposd used the rental app Airbnb, and little did she know it would change her le forever. The nanny booked to stay at a property owned by Dennis Weisse,  - and they ended up falling in love. After a three month whirlwind romance, Dennis popped the question despite the -year age gap. She said: “I was beginning to lose hope that I’d ever meet the love of my le. “It may sound corny, but Dennis has transformed my le and he treats me like a princess.” However, things almost didnapost work out as Dennis initially turned down her stay request as he thought she was planning a Covid- rules breaching party. Thankfully he realised his error and allowed her to stay, even surprising her with birthday presents, cupcakes and tequila. Bonding over their love of old school hip hop and rock music, they soon realised that, despite an age gap of more than quarter of a century, they had plenty in common. A whirlwind romance followed, with former UPS driver Dennis proposing to Angie, a nanny, at sunset in September, just three months after they met.  Angie, whose dad is  and mum is , said her family had been supportive of her decision – and had joked with Dennis’ -year-old son about being closer in age to him than her fiancé. In response to critics of age gap love, she said: “I would just say ‘live and let live’. “If you find somebody you love and they happen to be much older or much younger than you, as long as you are not harming anyone  and it is consensual and you love each other, you should never let age get in the way of true happiness and the chance of love.” For the four years before she met Dennis, Angie had been living just half an hour away in neighbouring Lehigh Acres, although their paths had never crossed. Their lives changed forever this summer when, unable to throw a traditional birthday party due to Covid- restrictions, she booked a two-night solo stay at his Airbnb.  “It was actually the first time I’d ever used Airbnb,” she added. Misinterpreting her message, in which she explained it was her th, Dennis thought Angie was planning to host a gathering, so initially rejected her request. She explained: “I wrote a very chatty greeting message for Dennis and told him it was my birthday. “But he misunderstood and thought I was planning to have a party, which I was not – I’m very cautious about Covid – so he rejected my request.” Realising his mistake, Dennis called Angie the following day to apologise – hoping to convince her to come for her trip as planned. “I said I understood and was okay with the rejection, but he was so friendly and such an outgoing and gregarious character. We had a really nice chat,” Angie continued.  “In the end, he sweettalked me and convinced me to go ahead with the trip.” In another twist of fate, Dennis was not even originally supposed to be in the state at the time of Angie’s visit. The way Airbnb works means that hosts do not always stay at the property with their guests. Some rent out entire homes, while others offer a private room. In Dennis’ case, he had intended to be in Colorado, almost , miles away, meaning Angie would have the place to herself. But when a couple who had been looking after the property back in Florida unexpectedly had to leave, he had no choice but to fly home and make sure the house was ready for her arrival. And to ensure she had the best birthday possible, he even arranged a special surprise for her. He said: “Because of all the confusion with the site, I wanted to do something really nice for her birthday. “I had the couple who had been looking after the property arrange some balloons, a birthday banner, card, cupcakes and tequila on the kitchen counter before they left. “If they hadn’t left, I would never have come back to Florida, so never would have met Angie in person. The Lord works in mysterious ways.” When Angie arrived on July  – the day before her th – she was blown away by the gesture. That night, Dennis came back home from Colorado and the pair spent the evening chatting, immediately hitting it off. Dennis stayed in his bedroom, while Angie slept in one of the guest rooms on the other side of the house. She said she was a ‘little bit nervous’ about him being there for her stay, but because of the ‘wonderful phone call’ they had shared beforehand she already felt comfortable around him.  Angie said: “The next morning – my th birthday – we had coffee and he made me breakfast. We drank champagne mimosas on his pool patio. “The conversation got even easier and more relaxed. Despite our age dference it’s very easy to get along and talk to each other.” On July , she ed home to Lehigh Acres with thoughts of Dennis on her mind. Angie, whose previous largest age gap in a relationship was five years, said she ‘ per cent knew’ there was a romantic spark between them. Three days later, she went back to North Fort Myers to stay with him for a few days – and their relationship quickly progressed. “We quickly started to fall in love and became basically inseparable,” Angie said. Their first moment of intimacy sealed the deal for Dennis. He said: “We were floating in the pool and our first kiss was in the water. Again, the light-bulb went off and it was a kiss like no other.”  And at the beginning of September, Dennis invited Angie to move in with him. She added: “He entrusted me with a key and even got down on one knee to offer it to me. “Living together is great. Dennis always cooks lovely meals for me. We make each other laugh, and dote on one another.” Their relationship going from strength to strength, Dennis took things to the next level on September , when he got down on one knee for a second time and asked Angie to marry him on a trip to Captiva Island,  mins away from North Fort Myers on the Gulf of Mexico. She recalled: “We’d had dinner at a fancy restaurant, then afterwards, he got down on one knee again to propose marriage with a stunning sunset backdrop.  “It was so romantic.” It did not come as a big shock to Angie – because they spoke about marriage in late July, and picked out the ring together a couple of days prior to the engagement. She said: “It was no big surprise – but it was a wonderful, wonderful moment.” Now, the couple, whose family and friends are overjoyed for them, are planning an intimate wedding ceremony next year. Reflecting on her amazing love story, Angie cannot believe what was supposed to be a quiet birthday staycation has changed her le so drastically. She concluded: “I could never have imagined I would fall in love with my Airbnb host. My le has been totally transformed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"couple rearrange wedding just 24","story":"NewsCouple rearrange their wedding in just  hours to beat new coronavirus restrictionsKimmi and Mark Fiander had planned to get married on New Years Eve but they were forced to rearrange their wedding plans quickly after new restrictions threatened to have it cancelled againmirrorShareCommentsByAmy ReastOliver Loveridge-GreeneKieren Williams:,  JAN NewsMark and Kimmi Fiander on their wedding day that they rearranged in only  hours \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Their original plans to get married in New York, in the US, in September  were postponed and led them to rearrange it for the end of . But on December , when new lockdown measures were announced that would plunge their county of Norfolk into Tier , the couple were faced with another postponement. The new Tier  restrictions would come into force from Boxing Day, cancelling the couple’s wedding. England will now enter a full lockdown from Wednesday. Have you had a wedding during the pandemic  Let us know in the comments below However, the couple refused to let it stop them and raced to rearrange their wedding at the very last minute. The pair, from Heacham, Norfolk, were forced to forgo a wedding cake and improvised the bridesmaidsapos dresses as the couple scrambled around to make sure their big day went ahead in time. Kimmi phoned up the vicar who got back to her within an hour saying they could be squeezed in the next day. The two jumped at the chance of walking down the aisle within only hours, despite Kimmi’s dress not arriving until Christmas Eve morning.  The couple called up their  guests to tell them of the hastily rearranged plans before they got married at Heacham Church. Now happily man and we, the couple are looking forward to spending  planning their honeymoon. Mark said: It was a crazy  hours. “Butwe hadn’t done it, we’d still not be married now, it had to be Christmas Eve or nothing. When the announcement was made The Mrs was pretty upset about it so we had to do something.  We agreed to the wedding for the next day but Kimmiaposs wedding dress hadnapost even arrived When the new tier system was announced, we were in Tier  things were looking up with the vaccine, so we decided to book a small local on New Years Eve at our village church. We had arranged it with our local vicar, Veronica, which would then be followed by a reception at the Rose and Crown. “But when we finished work on rd December we listened to the Tier announcements as everything was changing. We were in Tier  at the time and we thought we might go to Tier  so we could still have the wedding but then they jumped us from Tier  to Tier .”  The couple were left distraught, and Kimmi in tears, as it felt like they’d never be able to get married. On the off chance their vicar, Veronica, would be able to do something, they rang her up. Little did they know she was “already working on it”. As soon as Veronica heard the news she was on the phone to the Bishop, trying to work something out for the couple. They realised the only way was to squeeze them in before New Years, so she asked the couplethey could do the next day. Using Zoom, they virtually applied for their marriage licenses and were able to have a happy wedding in the end.  We had a Christmas themed wedding. Because the two bridesmaids dresses didnapost arrive we dressed them in burgundy ones as it fitted with the theme.” Mark said, He added: We couldnapost get a cake done in time and we had to get extra flowers from the florist as we hadnapost finished all that yet. “We had  people all together, me, Kimmi, the vicar Veronica and  guests.” Thankfully, everything went to plan and the couple were happily married at the time. Mark said: “It wasn’t what we had planned, but we didn’t have time to even think about that, or feel nervous, and I don’t think it could have gone any better.

He claimed gyms were essential to the physical and mental health of the population. A member of the public called the police when they saw the business was still open and officers warned Mr Whitcombe he needed to shut his doors. Shortly afterwards seven or eight armed officers descended on the gym and told the owner to kick out his customers and he was fined £, by Merseyside Police. Do you think gyms should remain open  Let us know in the comments below However, when Lancashire entered Tier  shortly afterwards, the county was allowed to keep its gyms open, prompting an outcry from Merseyside leaders and eventually a change in policy. Mr Whitcombe, who made appearances on TV about his case, tested positive for the virus on December .He told the Liverpool Echo he has been experiencing mild symptoms including fatigue, a raised temperature and a sore throat. Revealing the news to his , followers on Instagram, he said: Inevitable I suppose wasn’t it... I had what I thought was an extremely mild cold, minus one night of a high temp, the only symptoms I can report are a slightly runny nose and I’ve slept an extra hour for the last nine days. One of my close friends has it too, similar age, vegetarian diet, non smoker, it’s hit him like a moderate flu, much harder than me. Point being person to person our symptoms manest dferently. He added: I have elderly relatives who mean the world to me who would not survive this, I have a partner with respiratory issues and would likely be hospitalised.  Caution is unquestionably warranted. It’s important for me to continue to mention in each post that although I am anti-lockdown, I am not anti-Covid. He stressed he is not a covid denier after receiving online abuse from some, although he has received criticism for suggesting the risks of coronavirus, which has claimed the lives of more than , people in the UK, are exaggerated for healthy people. Mr Whitcombe insists he did not contract the virus in his gym as he had been working abroad until mid December and has not been training.

Rescue centres and pet websites have been flooded with ed pups and adverts trying to sell them. During the first lockdown many adopted puppies but are now struggling to properly provide the time and care needed for the animals. Sellers have flooded websites with adverts for young dogs aged between six and  months to try and move them on. Many owners have been forced to admit they do not have time or money or desire to keep looking after their puppies. Did you buy a puppy during lockdown  Let us know in the comments below When people began working from home last year demand for puppies surged and prices rocketed to as much as £, for some breeds. But now, charities have been inundated with calls to help rehome animals. Dogs Trust have received calls from over , people over the past three months, wanting to hand over dogs younger than one-year-old. They received  calls on December  and  alone, including for  puppies under nine months old. Others have taken to online reselling sites to move their pets along.  Sites like Petsyou and Preloved are seeing dozens of new adverts as owners try to sell their pets on. Two Pomeranian Chihuahua puppies are being sold from Haringey, London after the owner does not have the time they deserve. The owner selling a seven-month-old springer spaniel explained that the £, dog “needs more than we can offer her”, according to the Sunday Times, whose investigation exposed the issue. In Buckinghamshire, an owner selling a six-month-old collie-spaniel cross said: “Unfortunately, due to work commitments now we are no longer able to give him the loving and care he requires and deserves.” Research by the Kennel Club says that one in five owners who bought a puppy during the pandemic had not considered the long-term responsibilities looking after a pet brings.  It also found that a quarter of new owners admitted impulse buying their puppy in the first months of the pandemic. The RSPCA was “really concerned” that so many dogs were being ed and resold and the organisation was “bracing itself” for animals to be abandoned. The charity added: “We were worried that many families who found themselves at home with time on their hands during lockdown would make impulse decisions to take on pets – and now, just a few months on, would be seeking to rehome their new dogs after realising how much commitment they are, having run into financial dficulties due to the pandemic, or because theyaposve ed to work and no longer have time for them.” Adam Clowes, the operations director for the Dogs Trust stressed the importance of owners knowing that a dog was a ten to -year commitment. He said: “All that initial lockdown excitement – aposWe are never going to have to go into the office again, letaposs get a dog!apos – we are now seeing the consequence of that.”  RSPCA inspector Mike Beamen has come across examples of dogs who have been abandoned during the pandemic. Scooby, a Jack Russel terrier cross Corgi, was found in an alleyway in Surrey on th December. Mr Beaman said: “A member of the public had found the little tan and white dog tied up to a lamp post down an alleyway when he was walking his own dog at around pm. “When he passed again, around five hours later, the little dog was still there, wearing a harness and attached with a metal chain. “It was raining, cold and the poor little dog was shivering so he untied him and took him home before calling us.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle admits unladylike habit","story":"NewsMeghan Markle admits unladylike habit after a few drinks - but shes tried to stopMeghan Markle used her old lestyle blog, The Tig, to share details about her le, writing honestly about the things she loves but also the things she hoped to change about herselfmirrorShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  JAN NewsLike all of us, Meghan Markle has a few things she wishes to change about herself \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Claire Haythorne, from Hillsborough, Sheffield, had spent weeks in a coma battling Covid- before doctors administered Anakinra as a last resort, Yorkshire Live reports. Just over a week after taking the drug, which is normally used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, care worker Mrs Haythorne awoke from her coma.Her daughter, Leah, , was gobsmacked by her mumaposs swt recovery, with the doctor who prescribed the medication describing it as a little Christmas miracle. Mrs Haythorne, , was in a coma at Northern General Hospital for weeks after contracting the virus at the start of November. Medics decided to administer the drug Anakinra as a last resort, telling her family at the time she had three days to live. Mrs Haythorne is now on the road to recovery and set to head home in the coming fortnight to her children Leah, Jordan, , and her husband Tariq. Itaposs been something of a harsh wake up call for the family, who were initially sceptical of how bad the affects of the virus would be on them. As a care worker, Mrs Haythorne found out she had the virus through one of the mandatory tests she had every week at the start of November.She didnapost display symptoms at the time but went home to isolate. Her daughter Leah Haythorne, , said: She was alright to quarantine for two weeks. On Friday she got in bed and by Sunday the th November, sheaposd lost all the colour in her face. You couldnapost recognise her. Then Monday she got rushed into hospital. That was the last time we saw her. Mrs Haythorne continued to deteriorate rapidly while in ICU at Northern General Hospital and was placed in an induced coma on Thursday, November . Leah said: Her kidneys and lungs were proper bad. She was needing lots of oxygen.  After weeks of trying ious cures, on December  doctors decided to start giving her the drug Anakinra or Kineret. Leah said: The doctors said it was a last resort. But the improvements were instantaneous. The eighth was my brotheraposs birthday and thataposs the day she made the most improvement, said Leah. By the th she was awake. They started slowly reducing the medication and she slowly started to wake up. She started by reacting to her name and moving her arm and then she woke up. When she went on the medication theyaposd given her three days to live. Theyaposd saidit didnapost work they wonapost know what to do next. It was just a waiting game. Literally waiting day in and day out. The family became increasingly supportive of each other while Claire was going through treatment, with Leah saying: Itaposs made me and my brother close. We didnapost know what we had until it was taken away from us.

We live together, but don’t have any children.We’ve always had a good relationship – we laugh together, we’re close friends and sex has always been good, too. However, the other night I was checking the internet history on a shared computer to find a shopping page I’d been on earlier and I came across loads of searches for gay porn.There’s no one  who has access to this computer, so it’s clearly my boyfriend. I’m not prudish about pornography – I’ve looked at it myself, we’ve looked at it together and I know he looks at it when he’s on his own sometimes.However, naturally, I’m now wondering whether he’s gay or perhaps bisexual. I’m shocked because he’s never mentioned finding men attractive since we’ve been together and I’ve never suspected he’s anything but a straight guy. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since, but haven’t been able to pluck up the courage to confront him.

The Prime Minister ordered schools to shut - after just one day back after Christmas - and told people again to stay at home in ato the stark messaging from March. But scientists have warned that the strict lockdown may not even succeed in lowering infection rates as the first national shutdown did last spring. A new national lockdown was still inevitable and necessary, experts have said, with daily cases yesterday reaching a record high of more than ,.  But the new virus iant is a game changer and its high transmissibility means the latest lockdown may not be as effective as the initial March shutdown, warned Professor Mark Woolhouse. The professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh said: The new iant is a game changer and made the Prime Ministeraposs announcement of a full national lockdown for England almost inevitable. Given the estimates of the transmissibility of the new iant, this lockdown may not be as effective as the one last March. It may be that the best we can hope for is that the situation does not deteriorate further. He urged the Government not to just focus on lockdown but to ramp up other measures such as mass testing, better surveillance of cases, and support for people required to self-isolate to maximise compliance with the crucial intervention. Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome, said the point had been reached where national lockdown restrictions were needed immediately and called on people to respect the measures as health staff battle the virus on the front lines. He said: Healthcare workers are working with unselfish and inspiring dedication, but the demand is overwhelming the capacity of what can be delivered by these amazing professionals.  They must have all our support, meaning we all respect the restrictions, helping to reduce transmission of this awful virus, ultimately reducing hospitalisations and preventable deaths. He reiterated the importance of ensuring global access and supply of Covid- vaccines, warning: Leave one country behind and we are all exposed to risk, and to le taking longer and longer to ing to anything like normal. Professor Sir Gordon Duff of the University of Oxford, former co-chairman of the Governmentaposs Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , said the lockdown is justied in a time of national emergency. He said: The measures announced, although hard to endure, are justied. It was good to see the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition putting aside political dferences in the best interests of all.  There is no doubt that we face tough times, but vaccines will give us eventual victory. Sage member Professor Calum Semple said the easing of restrictions in some areas over the festive period, and the new more transmissible iant, made fresh national measures inevitable. The University of Liverpool academic told Sky News: Weaposre only now seeing the start of the price we have to pay for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day mixing. With that and the new iant it was inevitable we were going to have to hit a hard lockdown at this stage. His comments were echoed by Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Governmentaposs New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group . He said: The new iant made these measures inevitable and necessary.  The next few weeks will show whether they are enough to suppress the much more transmissible new iant which is now predominating in the country. Dame Til Wykes, professor of clinical psychology and rehabilitation at Kingaposs College London, said closing schools is not a decision to be made lightly but it is clearly the right decision to slow the transmission risk and save our NHS. She added: NHS staff continue to need our support. We donapost need to clap for them, we just need to stay at home and follow all the rules. The evidence is that most people are being very careful, but there are still some who think that Covid- is a myth or that they are immortal - neither are true.Dr David Strain of the University of Exeter Medical School, co-chairman of the British Medical Associationaposs medical academic staff committee, said: We welcome the PMaposs definitive actions to halt the rise in coronavirus and the hospitalisations that accompany it, albeit a little later than we would have liked and the science would have dictated.In a televised address to the nation on Monday night, the Prime Minister told the nation to stay indoors other than for limited exceptions, with measures expected to last until mid-February.

That was the start of the Industrial Revolution, which put the Great into Britain. But now it’s more profitable to send them home to work, employers are happy to do that. “Bosses predict the end of full-time office working” read the headline over a story that three-quarters of businesses will keep home working that was introduced last year. I suspect it won’t be a matter of choice, but a condition of the work relationship that passes for employment these days. Do you feel your bosses are benefiting from the pandemic  Have your say in the comments section Pandemics can produce profit. If it suits the bottom line, people will have to do the job from their child’s bedroom – or find other work. “Working from home, or workshy at home ” I asked early on. But productivity has held up well, because six out of  say they find it impossible to switch off.  Instead of working from home, we’re living at work. I’ve been doing it most of this century. Fragmentation of employment has been going on for years. Covid- has accelerated the trend, putting greater power in the hands of the employer, who no longer has to provide office space, heating, lighting or car parks. And there will be no office romance on Zoom.

Toilet roll, vegetables and rice have reportedly been running low in some stores. Retailers have also experienced increased demand for online delivery slots after Mr Johnsonaposs announcement.

A source close to the Duke of York said that his future role will only be resolved once the legal process has concluded. Andrew faces questions over his relationship with the late paedophile financier who is alleged to have trafficked sex slaves. These include claims by Virginia Giuffre that she was made by Epstein to have sex with the Duke. The Duke, who stepped back from royal duties after a disastrous BBC interview on the claims in , strongly denies any wrongdoing. Last year it was reported that he was keen toto a frontline role - but he now accepts this is unlikely, it is claimed. The source told The Mirror: The Duke’s future role is only likely to seriously considered once the legal process has been resolved and the Duke’s side of the story properly explained. Until then, the Duke is sensitive to the public mood and to the fact that the institution must come first. Last month the Queen was reported to have created a new team of eight royals who would carry out royal engagements - with Andrew left in the cold. US prosecutors are keen to speak to the Duke of York following the arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is awaiting trail on child sex offences. US prosecutor Geoffrey Berman claimed Andrew has repeatedly declined to be interviewed, despite fresh calls to do so following Maxwellaposs arrest in July. He is reportedly prepared to give a written statement, but has not agreed to be interviewed face-to-face. The Dukeaposs representatives have declined to comment, saying: We cannot comment on the legal process as any communications would be covered by the DOJ’s own confidentiality rules, which we have always observed. Andrewaposs representatives also declined to shed light on whether the public is paying for his legal and PR representation, saying: I’m afraid we would never comment on the contractual terms of the working group.”  The royal has previously dismissed the allegation by Ms Giuffre, who claimed she had sex with him at Maxwellaposs London home in . In a car-crash interview with the BBC, he claimed Ms Giuffreaposs story couldnapost be true because he was at a birthday party with his daughter Beatrice on March , . Ms Giuffre - who was  at the time - alleges that she partied with the Duke of York at West End nightclub Tramp that night, before they went back to Ms Maxwellaposs home. A photo, which is thought to have been taken at around the same time, shows Andrew with his arms around Ms Giuffre, whose name was Virginia Roberts in .

With pub, restaurants and bars also closed - those living in Englandwill only have access to supermarkets and a few other retailers offering essential food and drink items. Much of the national lockdown restrictions will mirror those of Tier , where all non-essential businesses closed days before Christmas.Tonight, Boris Johnson addressed the nation with a firm stay at home message.Acceptable reasons to leave home are strictly reduced to travelling to workyou cannot work from home, to volunteer, to exercise alone or with one other person outside your household or bubble, to care for a vulnerable person, to attend medical appointments and to shop for necessities. When it comes to shopping, supermarkets have adapted how they operate throughout the year in order to account for social distancing measures and accommodate vulnerable customers. But how will the latest lockdown affect your local supermarket Asda Asda announced it would increase coronavirus safety measures at stores across the country in the run-up to Christmas.Asda also released a new virtual queueing app called aposQudiniapos which is available for all  main stores. It allows customers to wait in their cars until there is a slot availablethe store is busy. The  busiest stores will also have automatic counting technology which allows the store to control access and help customers social distance. In addition, the supermarket has added a protective antimicrobial coating to several customers touch points, such as fridges and freezer handles, in all stores. The coating adds a protective film which helps to kill bacteria and viruses and is being applied to all basket and trolley handles too. Face covering for everyone who is not medically exempt must also be worn. Tesco  Some Tesco stores have cordoned off non-essential aisles such a kitchenware and clothing. The superstore has also brought in a one in one out system that will be used to limit the number of people in stores at any given time. Social distancing will continue to be maintained while customers are shopping and face coverings must be worn unless a customer is medically exempt. The supermarket has placed staff at the entrances of larger stores to inform customers of the procedures in place and ensure they are wearing a face coveringthey are not exempt. A traffic light system has been implemented in some stores which will let customers know when they can enter safelyand when it is at capacity . Hand sanitiser is readily available for customers around the store and extra cleaning products for customers to wipe down trolleys and baskets will be available also. Protective screens have been installed at the front and back of all checkouts so they can all be opened to speed up serving time. Aldi  Aldi has introduced a traffic light system and was one of the first supermarkets to do so during the initial lockdown The store is encouraging shoppers to pick quieter times to do their shopping which is often between the hours of pm to pm. NHS and emergency services staff will be given priority access to the store. Lidl Lidl has no specic store-wide restrictions in place, but managers are able to use their discretion to limit panic buying. The supermarket asks customers to shop at quieter times and face coverings must be worn, unless a customer is medically exempt. Sainsburyaposs  Sainsburyaposs says it is constantly reviewing in-store rules. These include Perspex safety screens between checkouts and additional cleaning, to hand sanitiser and signs inside and throughout stores which remind customers to keep a safe distance. Queueing systems outside of Sainsbury’s stores will be implemented when necessary and only one adult per household will be allowed into the shop at any one time. Sainsbury’s will continue to be prioritising elderly and vulnerable customers for online delivery slots but no current confirmation is available on how long customers will need to wait for a slot. Elderly and vulnerable customers still have priority entry from  am to  am on Monday, Wednesday and Friday while NHS staff and care workers still have priority entry from : am to  am between Monday and Saturday. Face coverings, unless medically exempt, are also mandatory.Morrisons Morrisons has encouraged customers to book their food shop delivery well in advance due to high demand. The supermarket offers a next-day doorstep delivery service for customers who are self-isolating or unable to get to a store. Those who are self-isolating and in need of an emergency grocery delivery can phone    and select option five. NHS workers also still have priority access to a Morrisons store and can visit from - am, Monday to Saturday, and : am on Sundays to be able to shop when it is quieter. The supermarkets are also managing queues outside of shops by allowing customers with a basket to skip the queue. Customers doing a smaller shop can get into the store where three customers who are only carrying a basket can enter for every one person with a trolley. Face covering are also mandatory.

Gareth Baines gave up his position as a Welsh Conservative association chairman following the unsavoury message about people waiting in accident and emergency units.He said that many parents were taking their children to hospital just so that they could gain sympathetic likes on Facebook, the Daily Post reported. On New Year’s Eve, Mr Baines tweeted from his account @DrGABaines: “AEs in Germany aren’t full of fat mums in pot noodle-stained leggings  pjs taking their kids for a day out at AE to harvest Facebook likes because their darling little snot-covered Asbo fell over. Happy New Year.”  Mr Baines – who says on his Twitter profile that he has an honorary doctorate in business administration - quit his role as chairman of Clwyd South Conservative Association after the tweet was met with severe backlash. He remains a member of Chirk Town Council and at the December  General Election acted as agent for the winning Conservative candidate Simon Baynes, who took Clwyd South from the former Labour MP Susan Elan Jones.In another tweet, he said: “Our NHS is treated as a sacred cow and cannot be criticised. Those arguing for reform are deemed to be Satan incarnate. “I’m sorry, but after spending most of my le working on the continent, the NHS isn’t the best in the world - it isn’t one of the best in Europe.  Pales when compared with systems like Germany and Norway.” Mr Baines was strongly criticised after sending out the first tweet. Former local Liberal Democrat council candidate Aimi Waters, a planning analyst and a foster parent, tweeted: “Chairman of Clwyd South Conservatives showing his true colours there. Oh dear. Come on though, are we all surprised  #NeverTrustATory.” A later tweet from Ms Waters read: The actions of the @clwyds chair are totally unacceptable.

Little Kennedy Mercer - sister of TOWIE star Ky Stratford - spent three weeks in intensive care after contracting the virus, with medics telling parents Paul and Jeanette to prepare for the worst.The schoolgirl has a rare condition called Spinal Muscular Atrophy , which makes her extremely vulnerable to coronavirus.Her twin brother Karter died from Type  SMA at just five months old, and Paul said he feared losing Kennedy as she battled Covid- late last year. Paul said it isnapost just adults who are at risk of dying from coronavirus, and said clarity is needed on when vulnerable youngsters can be vaccinated. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror The dad, from Grays in Essex, said: We didnapost knowshe was going to make it. She went through a torrid time, it literally impacted her whole body. It was awful to watch. The doctors told us they were changing the antibiotics they were giving her, and that it needed to work because there was nothing  they could do. Paul has now called on authorities to clary when high-risk children will be given a vaccine, saying: There are a large group of vulnerable children who will lose their livesthey catch the virus. Weaposre not asking to jump the queue, we just need to know whataposs going on, Paul said. Thereaposs a lot of extremely vulnerable children who would benefit from receiving the vaccine. Current guidance says extremely vulnerable children can be vaccinated - but no timetable has been issued. He said families have been pushing for answers on when youngsters are expected to receive vaccines, but to no avail. In spite of her family making huge efforts to shield Kennedy - including taking weekly tests and separating her from her five-year-old sister Marli, who ed to school in the summer - she became ill in late October.Her temperature soared, and she developed pneumonia and sepsis. As her condition worsened, medics told to prepare for the worst. During their anxious wait at Kennedyaposs bedside at Londonaposs Great Ormond Street Hospital , Paul said there were many other children who were seriously ill with Covid.During Kennedyaposs fight for le, TOWIE star Ky posted on Instagram : We are all so heartbroken as kennedy has severe breathing problems from her terminal illness SMA as it is.So this is very dangerous for her.  Kyaposs post continued: She is in intensive care but really fighting like she always does, so i just need everyone to keep her in your prayers and hopefully she gets through this my strong little girl she doesn’t deserve any of this. Harrowing pictures show the little girl fighting for le as her temperature soared past F, when course after course of drugs failed to make an impact. Thankfully her temperature came down, but we donapost yet knowshe had any long-term damage, Paul said. When Kennedy was discharged in November, she still had inflamed kidneys. She is due to a scan next month to find outthis has improved.Paul said medics told him that antibodies may last for as little as  weeks - leaving Kennedy at risk of reinfection. While shielding, the youngster is missing out on the experiences her parents are desperate for her to have. Every parent Iaposve interacted with who has an extremely vulnerable child is concerned that thereaposs no information, Paul said. Despite the rollout of two vaccines - one manufactured by Pfizer and the other by Oxford University and AstraZeneca - families are yet to learn when vulnerable children will be given a jab.  Both the Department of Health and NHS England declined to comment, saying the guidance on the vaccine rollout was drawn out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . The JCVI says: The committee advises that only those children at very high risk of exposure and serious outcomes, such as older children with severe neuro-disabilities that require residential care, should be offered vaccination. Clinicians should discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with a person with parental responsibility, who should be told about the paucity of safety data for the vaccine in children aged under  years. SMA, which affects around , children and adults in the UK, is a deadly condition which means children struggle to breathe, swallow or even sit up without support.

A yellow weather warning for ice remains in place until am in the East of England, Northern Ireland, the West Midlands, East Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, the North East and the Grampians. Overnight temperatures are set to drop to -C in parts, with the daytime not a whole lot better as the mercury struggles in the lower single digits - hovering just above freezing in Scotland. Later in the week, temperatures will drop well below freezing in Scotland and northern England. Temperatures briefly touching  or  degrees in the afternoon and then going right back down again during the course of the evening, BBC meteorologist Tomasz Schafernaker said. Persistent rain is expected in the South East, with between mm and mm set to fall over two days.  Some parts of the UK could see sleet and snow, though it will largely stay on higher ground. Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said the South East could see some snow on Thursday and Friday, butit happens, it wonapost stay around for long. She added: We may see the odd flurry down to lower levels, particularly in the North East, maybe the North West depending on what day youaposre looking at, but certainly any snow to lower levels will be quite transient really and not last very long.  Meanwhile, meteorologists have observed a sudden stratospheric warming is under way, which is associated with very cold weather. Sudden stratospheric warming three years ago brought the heavy snow termed the Beast from the East. However, the Met Office said the event is more likely to bring more cold weather without heavy snow, though it is dficult to predict.  The agency is also tracking a La Nina in the Pacic, which could bring wet and stormy weather as it increases the UKaposs chances of westerly winds. Ms Maxey said: Youaposve got the two events happening at the same time so they vie against each other in a sense. Theyaposre sort of fighting for influence over the UK, weaposre a very small dot in the middle of the ocean. She added that the warming in the stratosphere takes at least  days to move down into our atmosphere. Ms Maxey continued: The feeling at the moment is that we may see some colder weather towards the end of January into February, but probably the sort of weather that weaposre seeing at the moment, as opposed to what is popularly perceived as a Beast from the East. Thereaposs still a lot to play for, weaposre keeping an eye on the situation, the experts are working on how that might influence our weather.

It has provided so much entertainment during lockdown. My friends think I am crazy, they even bought me Boris Johnson books and t-shirts for Christmas.

Police claim her victims include an eight-year-old girl who was allegedly killed after she cheekily threw ice cream at the OAP after being told to be quiet. When police arrested the grey-haired pensioner they found human intestines in her fridge and she was dubbed the Russian Sweeney Todd. Sweeney Todd is a British Victorian tale about a barber who sells people pies made with human flesh. A few fragments of human remains were found at the time that they identied as belonging to the child - shocking the girlaposs mother Natalya Alekseenko. Even when the woman was put on trial she refused to accept that her daughter might not still be alive somewhere. Police claim she started to carry out the murders after the death of her husband in . She was held by police after janitor Vasily Shlyakhtich, , who had agreed to rent a room in her apartment in the village of Berezovka, located in the Khabarovsk urban district of the Khabarovsk Territory, vanished in January . Locals said the woman had spent years working as a labourer and was strong for her age, and often carried an axe with her. They had often complained about her killing local cats, but had never suspected her of also killing people.  One local identied only by her first name Tatyana said at the time: We always found it strange that despite being surly and unfriendly, she would often find the time to cook things for the local children. They were always meat dishes. Sometimes she gave them to the adults, she bought me and my husband plates with jellied meat. She added: I remember it well because my husband said letaposs not eat it, you never know what it was made from, and now it looks like he was right. Tatyana said police had claimed that she used meat from the people she killed for the dishes. The three murders she was on trial over include the eight-year-old girl, Mr Shlyakhtich and a -year-old woman.  Under interrogation, she is said to have admitted to killing her lodger, and as the police probed deeper, they were shocked when she then allegedly also admitted to killing an eight-year-old girl who disappeared in December . She went on trial in October over the other murders where she shocked the court by laughing as the charges were read out, and the hearing continued into last year when the court ordered a retrial in June. The case which was being heard at the Khabarovsk Regional Court was then delayed because of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions. As well as the three people she was accused of murdering, police also believe that she was responsible for the murder of a female friend, Nina Babenko, aged , after she moved in as a lodger in April . She was never seen again.

The animal sanctuary in South Africa has come under criticism for its decision to allow the gym-owner to pose for pictures which show her hanging from the elephant’s tusks. The South African woman, who has been identied as Emma Roberts, was described as “absolutely abhorrent” and the sanctuary has come under fire too. But this isn’t the first time that the sanctuary, Adventures with Elephants, in the Mabula District, has allowed such a thing to happen. Pictures from their social media have shown others hanging off the tusks, and as many as three people riding the elephants - a practice widely considered cruel because of the strain it puts on elephant’s backs. What do you think  Let us know in the comments below Ms Roberts was pictured performing the pull and the incident sparked anger online. One person said: “Absolutely abhorrent. People donapost understand the horror that wild animals go through to aposperform.apos Elephant spines are not meant for holding humansapos weight.” And another added: “Canapost believe she did that. She doesnapost have common sense and empathy. The elephant deserves to be treated with respect. Be kind to them.” However, Ms Roberts released a statement on her now-deleted Instagram defending her actions. She suggested anyone who criticised her was unenlightened and that her pull-up had been an “amazing moment with this animal”.  The gym owner refused to apologise and added: “For the sake of this amazing facility I have opted to remove my post. “I do not agree that sharing an amazing moment with this animal is cruel in any way. However, there are many humans out there who only see the negative. “Beating elephants is cruel, riding them is not ideal, keeping them in horrible environments and killing them for their ivory is cruel.” The RSPCA has advised against riding elephants on holidays because it is cruel to the animal, and the animals often have to be illegally captured and beaten until compliant, the charity said.“Providing them with a home in their natural environment and educating people about how intelligent and wonderful they are is not cruelty.” She said. She added: “Unfortunately only a small percentage of the world is enlightened enough to see this. “Those of you who have sent me wonderful messages, thank you. “Those of you who have made this amazing experience for me feel like something I should be ashamed of... Shame on you.” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.31879719-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.31879719-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.31879719-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.31879719-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"fundraiser for dundee footballers family raises more than 11000","story":"More than £, has been raised for the family of a popular junior footballer following his death.The body of Ryan Blair, , was found on Hogmanay.Ryan, described as “football daft” by his family, had played for a number of Dundee teams, including North End Football Club, Lochee United, Broughty Athletic and, most recently, Downfield JFC.In the days following Ryan’s death, North End started a fundraising drive to raise money for the talented defender’s wider family.The club have received vast support following the launch of the JustGiving page and remain on track to achieve their £, goal.Bruce Harper of North End Football Club said that they were overwhelmed by the generosity of those who have donated thus far.The club launched their appeal at pm on Saturday night and by mid afternoon yesterday £, had been raised.Bruce said: “The response has been overwhelming.“We wanted to do what we could for his young daughter at this tragic time to ensure that she has something behind her for the future.“I would ask all clubs in Dundee to get behind this and raise as much money as possible for Ava‘s future.”Meanwhile, Ryan’s most recent club Downfield have also been raising money for Ryan’s family.And they have received help from Dundee legend and former Celtic goalkeeper Rab Douglas.Peter Marr, president of Downfield JFC, said: “All at Downfield JFC were devastated to hear the sad news of defender Ryan Blair passing away.“Although he did not spend long with the club, Ryan became a treasured team mate and friend of all.

waiting game for new signings in the january transfer window","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes admits he may have to be patient in the bid to land signings this month.McInnes confirmed he has a #plan in place# to strengthen his squad for the second half of the campaign.However, he could face a sweat until the end of the January transfer window before landing targets.We have a plan in place of what we would like to do.“It is called the January window, but a lot of the time nothing really happens until the last few days.#Derek McInnesMcInnes recently confirmed he wants to secure an attacking game-changer this month.However, players will have to first exit Pittodrie first to open up space, and funds, for any new additions.McInnes said: “We have a plan in place of what we would like to do.“It is called the January window, but a lot of the time nothing really happens until the last few days.#I know where I would like to freshen up.“I would like to bring in one or two that could give us that bit more threat in the forward areas.“However, we are restricted in what we can do.“For us to really be able to do anything we need one or two players to move out to try something  and get regular football.“At the minute we stay as we are until that situation changes.#One player set to exit Pittodrie is Venezuelan international full-back Ronald Hernandez.The -year-old is back in Venezuela after the Dons gave special dispensation for him toto his family over the festive season.Hernandez’s we and young daughter have been stranded in Venezuela all year due to the coronavirus pandemic.Signed for £, on a four-and-a-half-year deal from Norwegian side Stabaek in January last year, Hernandez made just three starts for the Dons.MLS side Atlanta United, who entered into a strategic partnership with Aberdeen in November , are understood to be set to sign Hernandez on a four-year deal.McInnes was keen to extend the loan spell of Bristol City attacker Marley Watkins, who is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury.Bristol boss Dean Holden confirmed Watkins, out of contract in the summer, will notto fitness until next month – after the transfer window closes.Holden said Watkins will remain at Ashton Gate to complete his rehabilitation.However, Watkins was surplus to requirements in the first half of the season at Bristol and, with his contract set to expire at the end of the season, the -year-old remains an option for the Dons.McInnes is also keen on securing Ross County striker Ross Stewart on a pre-contract agreement for next season.Ross County view Stewart as pivotal to their bid to stay in the Premiership and would be reluctant to part with him this month.I have been a manager a long time and it is always traditionally dficult to get exactly what you want in January.#Derek McInnesMcInnes also recently refused to rule out ato Pittodrie for winger Gary Mackay-Steven, who is now a free agent.MLS side New York City recently opted not to renew Mackay-Steven’s contract.McInnes said: “As ever in January you want to maybe bring one player in that can improve the starting  and maybe another that can come in and really bolster the squad.“If you can get two to come in and do that then you would be happy with that.“I have been a manager a long time and it is always traditionally dficult to get exactly what you want in January.”Meanwhile, Aberdeen have recalled striker Bruce Anderson and midfielder Miko Virtanen from their loan spells in the Scottish Championship.McInnes confirmed the clause for both toin the January transfer window from scheduled season-long loans has been activated.Anderson, , had been on loan at Ayr United and netted two goals in  appearances, seven starts and three off the bench.Striker Anderson led the line in the first game of the season for Aberdeen due to a centre-forward injury crisis with both Sam Cosgrove and Curtis Main sidelined.Aberdeen lost that game, against Rangers, -.Finnish U international Virtanen, , made  appearances for Arbroath in the first half of this season, with  starts.Both rejoin the Aberdeen squad this week.McInnes said: “We have spoken to the clubs and Anderson and Virtanen will both come back into things.“They were allowed to play for their clubs on Saturday and then will come back in with us this week.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content,

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print please be aware that track and path closures can happen at any time. All walks are undertaken at your own risk. Please continue to adhere to current guidelines as set out by the government, exercise responsibly and use appropriate clothing and equipment for your chosen outdoor activity.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes amiss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!First footingA tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.TelevisionAs always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. Therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.Live eventsThe events that Scotlandrsquos festive season is famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year.

Naturally, this would not be the last time an IndyRef would be brought up this year.On January , the UK confirmed its first two cases of Covid-.FebruaryBy February , the forthcoming coronavirus pandemic seemed a million miles away ndash with only three cases confirmed by this point.Attention instead was on Storm Ciara ndash a powerful and long-lived cyclone which battered parts of the country with gusts of up to mph.Flooding and heavy wind caused damage to buildings and train services, and on February , a -year-old man died after falling on icy surfaces and banging his head during the storm.Another major news story to unfold in the last year was surrounding former finance secretary Derek Mackay MSP.Once tipped to become the next First Minister, the Scottish Sun revealed the now shamed politician had been pestering a -year-old schoolboy on social media.The paper reported the -year-old MSP had contacted the boy out of the blue without knowing his age the previous August, then sent him  messages over six months.MarchThen came March ndash a month that can only be described as the month coronavirus pandemic really hit home in Scotland.On March , Scotland had its first confirmed case of the virus in the NHS Tayside, followed soon after by its first death on March .By March ,  cases had been confirmed in the country, with the virus clearly beginning to spread into other health boards.The inevitable news then came ndash with all pubs, cafes and restaurants being forced to close on March , before a nationwide lockdown on March .On the same day, Alex Salmond was cleared of sexually assaulting nine woman while he was the First Minister.As the BBC reports, a jury found the former SNP leader not guilty on  of the sexual assault charges facing him, while another was found not proven.A further charge of sexually assaulting a th woman had previously been dropped by prosecutors. Throughout the trial, Mr Salmond said he was innocent of all charges.On March , Clap For Carers was launched - coined up as a way to show appreciation for those on the NHS and other frontline services during the pandemic.The event saw people taking to their doorsteps and windows at pm every Thursday to clap, cheer, ring bells and play bagpipes to show their support.The last formal clap took place on May , followed by an extea Clap for NHS on July  marking the nd anniversary of its establishment.AprilOn April , the Queen made a rare broadcast to the UK and wider Commonwealth, in which she thanked people for following social distancing rules and said the UK ldquowill succeed in its fight against the coronavirus.Echoing the words of Vera Lynnrsquos wartime song, she added ldquoWe will meet again.On the same day, Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer Dt Catherine Calderwood resigned after facing intense criticism for breaking lockdown rules twice to visit her second home during the pandemic.Dr Calderwood concluded with the First Minister that her position was untenable given the need for consistent and trustworthy public health messaging.Sticking with the pandemic, all eyes were on -year-old war veteran Tom Moore on April , who raised millions of pounds for NHS charities for walking more than  laps of his garden.In less joyful news, just four days later on April , Scotlandrsquos new temporary coronavirus hospital the NHS Louisa Jordan opened to receive Covid patients.MayOn May , Boris Johnsonrsquos senior advisor Dominic Cummings faced calls to resign after an investigation alleged he travelled  miles from London to his parentrsquos home in Durham while displaying coronavirus symptoms during lockdown.On May , Cummings held a press conference in the Downing Street Rose Garden, in which he said: ldquoI donrsquot regret what I did. The following day, Tory MP for Moray Douglas Ross, resigned as a Scotland Office minister over his views on the alleged breach.JuneOn June , a man with a kne stabbed six people, including a police officer and hotel staff, in the Park Inn Hotel in Glasgow.The attacker, Badreddin Abadlla Adam, was shot dead by a police officer on the scene.Police said the incident was not being treated as terrorism.JulyAfter a tough few months, beer gardens were allowed to reopen from July  ndash taking advantage of some warm weather that was about to come.Following weeks of guidance, Scotland made it officially law to make it compulsory to wear a face covering in shops across Scotland on July .AugustPupils in Scotland finally began ing to classrooms on August , without the need to socially distance ndash with pupils initially not having to wear face coverings. This was later changed on August , requiring the need for masks in corridors, canteens and other communal areas.The following day, on August , three people died after a passenger train derailed in Aberdeenshire.The . ScotRail service from Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street hit a landslide near to Stonehaven following heavy rain and thunderstorms.The victims were named as driver Brett McCullough, , conductor Donald Dinnie, , and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, .SeptemberOn September , the NHS Protect Scotland app was released to the public on iOS and Android devices, providing anonymous and Bluetooth-enabled contact tracing for those who download it in Scotland.On September , Nicola Sturgeon announced a ban on meeting in households as she came down hard following a rise in cases across the country.A pm curfew on pubs, similar to that already in place in England, was also confirmed.OctoberOn October , Margaret Ferrier, MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, was suspended by the SNP and referred herself to the police after it became known she had travelled from Scotland to Westminster the previous weekend, despite awaiting the outcome of a Covid test.She then chose to travel home again by train, despite being notied of the positive result.And on October , James Bond actor Sir Sean Connery died at the age of .The Scottish actor, best known for his portrayal of the  spy, died in his sleep in the Bahamas ldquohaving been unwell for some time, his son said.NovemberA new five level, or ldquotier, system of lockdown was introduced in Scotland on November , bringing in new targeted restrictions to dferent parts of the country.And after an agonising two-decade long wait, Scotlandrsquos menrsquos team finally reached the finals of a major football tournament after beating Serbia on penalties.A masterclass penalty save from keeper David Marshall sent Scotland through, with subsequent celebrations leading to the rise of now Tartan Army-favourite Yes Sir, I Can Boogie, to the top of the charts.DecemberWhat could only be described as a potential light at the end of the tunnel, the first coronavirus vaccinations were administered in Scotland on December .Thousands of people have so far been given their first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, which after two doses is thought to be % effective against Covid-.However, the good news didnrsquot last long, and following an outbreak of a new strain of Covid in the UK, the co-ordinated plan for Christmas across the UK was cancelled on December .Nicola Sturgeon announced a travel ban to other parts of the UK during the festive period, with people within Scotland only allowed to ease the rules on Christmas Day ndash not between December  and  as previously planned.On Boxing Day, Scotlandrsquos toughest levels of lockdown came into effect across all mainland areas, with schools now no longer resuming in the classroom until at least January .The tough new rules mean non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gums will close for at least four weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"steak-pie-scottish-new-years-day-tradition","story":"SCOTS love a steak pie to celebrate the New Year and cannot get enough of them, according to an industry expert.But therersquos a surprising reason as to why itrsquos become an annual tradition across the country.Bruce McColl, the member services manager for the Scottish Craft Butchers Association, was able to provide some insight into our January  delight.He said: ldquoOne theory holds that steak pie became the national dish at New Years because January  wasnrsquot generally taken as a holiday so families were too busy to cook, said Mr McColl.ldquoThey would buy steak pies to feed their families instead, this continues to this day as people want a delicious meal after the previous nightrsquos celebrations.ldquoSo it was essentially one of the first ready meals.Steak pie then could be the nationrsquos hangover cure on what is often the roughest morning of the year for many, after a night of celebratory drinking.Mr McColl added: ldquoThe other train of thought is that people would have it as their main meal on Hogmanay before they started to drink.ldquoItrsquos a good meal to be made in advance so a lot of people have it as their main meal before the bells.ldquoAnother theory is that because it is a big meal you can keep warm and serve to visitors throughout the day, as people come to the house.Steak pie, it seems, fits Scotlandrsquos New Years celebrations perfectly - whether as a meal which can feed a number of visitors popping in throughout the day, soak up the booze from the night before or to line onersquos stomach for a big night ahead.Do you enjoy a steak pie on January   Let us know in the

UK citizens will be allowed to stay in the EU for  days in any -day period without a visa, and the same will apply for EU citizens in the UK.The European Commission says the choice to end free movement ldquoinevitably means that business travel between the EU and the UK will no longer be as easy as it currently is.People heading from the UK for business have been told by the Government to check the requirements of the country they are travelling to.British passport holders will no longer be able to use the EU passport queue at airports and other borders.Will I need a visa for my holiday From , you will have to purchase a pound visa-waiver for holidays and short stays.UK nationals will not need a visa for short trips to EU countries theyre just going on holiday.But they will have to pay for a visa-waiver ndash this will cost euroand will be issued under the European Travel Information and Authorisation System.Can I work in the EU From  onwards you may need extra documents to work or study, or for trips longer than  days.Details of this have yet to be confirmed and it will likely depend on what you are doing and where you are going.But those going to work or study abroad, plus those just going on business trips, might be affected from January , , onwards.Will I need a blue passport No, your current passport is still eligible.Pre-Brexit, you could travel to EU countries on your passport right up to the point it expires ndash and that willcontinueto be the case this year, and will be until the end of the transition period on December .However, next year, the rules are changing.These changes were announced prior to the trade deal and arent expected to be affected by it.Under the new rules, fromJanuary , , when you visit most EU countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, your passport will need to have at least six months left on it until expiry and be less than ten years old on the day you travel.Will security change The UK will lose access to a iety of key EU databases - used by the police- covering things such as criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons.However, the UK will still have access to other systems which include cross-checks on fingerprints across Europe. This means that security co-operation will no longer be on ldquoreal-time access.The UK and the EU have reached an agreement on extradition, and the UKs role in Europol, the cross-border security agency, allows it to sit in on meetings but not have a direct say in decisions.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"absolutely confident\" the deal \"protects our police co-operation, protects our ability to catch criminals and to share intelligence across the European continent in the way that we have done for many years\".What about fishing The value of fish being caught by the EU in UK waters will be reduced by % and will be phased into transition over a five-and-a-half-year period.Once the transition period is over, the UK will fully control access to its waters and could make much deeper cuts.What is the impact on EU citizens living in the UK While Brexit affects everyone in the UK, the most immediate direct impact is on the . million people living here who are citizens of other EU countries.If you are a European Economic Area or Swiss citizen living in Britain, you wont have to leave the UK because weve left the EU.

This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.\"The First Minister added: \"Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.\"The decisioncomes as cases of Covid- have dramatically risen across the country, with, new positive cases announced today.Heres the key points from todays announcement:Stay at home messageFrom tomorrow,you live in a Level  areayou cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose - much like back in March.This means when you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Schools will stay closedNicola Sturgeon confirmed that schools will stay closed until February  for the majority of pupils.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.\"The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.\"We, therefore, have to adopt a cautious approach.\"So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.\"This decision will be reviewed on January  whether they canto school on February .Meeting people outdoorsFrom tomorrow,the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.Previously, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Working from homeAnyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Shielding advice changesIf you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Hospitals near capacityNicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to twoweeks ago.Other restrictions will also come into effect includingplaces of worship closing,no wakes, two-metre distancing in canteens and further premises closing.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.What help will be provided Grants areavailable for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions.

Everybody needs to try and make this work and that includes the companies that can take away the charging for data, he said.This is information for parents and carers, pupils and college students about the national lockdown in England.More details: https:t.co IwumBJZRZpic QZWLlomkpmdash Department for EducationJanuary , Mary Bousted, general secretary of the National Education Union , said it was down to the Prime Minister to push network operators to make data more affordable.ldquoWith child poverty figures on the rise, the challenge remains large ndash but action must be swt, immediate and game-changing, she said.ldquoWe must hear no more of rationing of equipment, as we did late last year. If the stockpiles exist, as the Department for Education claim they do, then they must be distributed urgently.ldquoWe have heard too many stories of requests from schools not being met, or not being fully met.ldquoWe must also see swt action to make internet connections and data allowance affordable for remote learning. This can only come from the top, with the Prime Minister speaking to communications companies and making that change immediately.On Monday, a letter sent to the Prime Minister from senior public figures including former education secretaries and former prime minister Tony Blair cites figures from Ofcom which estimate that between . million and . million children in the UKdo not have home access to a laptop, desktop or tablet, and that more than , children live in a household with only a mobile internet connection.And according to the communications regulatorrsquos Connected Nations report, published last month, around , properties across the UK cannot access a ldquodecent broadband connection.With the new lockdown underway, children need the tech  data capacity in place this week. Those children who havenrsquot got the tech should be offered a priority place in school from Monday.

They are surviving on broken phones ndash those children now need to be seen as a priority to get into the classroom and deemed to be a vulnerable child.ldquoThere is also the issue of the cost of data, and I think this is something that tech companies and broadband companies really need to step up to now.A number of technology providers have pointed to schemes they already have running to help disadvantaged pupils ndash Vodafone said its Schools.Connected initiative had so far distributed more than , SIM cards to primary and secondary schools across the UK in an effort to provide free connectivity to students.Vodafone also confirmed that it was in talks with the DfE about joining the GB free data-a-month scheme.While broadband provider Virgin Media launched an Essential broadband service late last year which it says offers a reliable and affordable internet connection to those facing financial dficulty..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Tech firms pledge to help with data and device access for students in lockdown"},{"url":null,"title":"david buchanans retirement podcast","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Clearly, we will stay closely involved and be seeking the best possible outcome as we have done in the past.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOSpy camera scheme takes a step forwardThe group planning to set up a town centre security system in Campbeltown is considering applying to the government for funding.The Scottish Office has just made £ million available to pay for , new closed circuit television cameras to help fight crime in Scottish towns.The driving force behind Campbeltown’s proposed system, Kintyre Crime Prevention Panel, recently received an estimate for the cost of installing a system from a leading security firm. Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A year that saw so many things we took for granted taken from us – our normal family events, our employment and our interaction with our friends.In true Kintyre style, we found ways of minimising the effects of these disruptions by using technology, supporting the vulnerable and keeping in touch by telephone. But it was a scary time for all of us.When this #Thought for the Week# was in the planning stage, we imagined that in our corner of Scotland, in Kintyre, we would be well rid of strict lockdowns, have a low position on the tier system and le would be getting back to some sort of normality. We are not there yet.When parents are bringing up children, they teach them by repetition – clean your teeth tidy your bedroom I love you, you are special.God, as our Father, does exactly the same.

Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!A tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.As always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.The events that Scotlandrsquos festive season are famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year. However, many are embracing a digital approach for the first time, making it easier for us to enjoy the festivities from our homes.Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay, which usually takes the form of an incredible street party with live performances and festivities, will instead be heading online.

Naturally, this would not be the last time an IndyRef would be brought up this year.On January , the UK confirmed its first two cases of Covid-.FebruaryBy February , the forthcoming coronavirus pandemic seemed a million miles away ndash with only three cases confirmed by this point.Attention instead was on Storm Ciara ndash a powerful and long-lived cyclone which battered parts of the country with gusts of up to mph.Flooding and heavy wind caused damage to buildings and train services, and on February , a -year-old man died after falling on icy surfaces and banging his head during the storm.Another major news story to unfold in the last year was surrounding former finance secretary Derek Mackay MSP.Once tipped to become the next First Minister, the Scottish Sun revealed the now shamed politician had been pestering a -year-old schoolboy on social media.The paper reported the -year-old MSP had contacted the boy out of the blue without knowing his age the previous August, then sent him  messages over six months.MarchThen came March ndash a month that can only be described as the month coronavirus pandemic really hit home in Scotland.On March , Scotland had its first confirmed case of the virus in the NHS Tayside, followed soon after by its first death on March .By March ,  cases had been confirmed in the country, with the virus clearly beginning to spread into other health boards.The inevitable news then came ndash with all pubs, cafes and restaurants being forced to close on March , before a nationwide lockdown on March .On the same day, Alex Salmond was cleared of sexually assaulting nine woman while he was the First Minister.As the BBC reports, a jury found the former SNP leader not guilty on  of the sexual assault charges facing him, while another was found not proven.A further charge of sexually assaulting a th woman had previously been dropped by prosecutors.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon. This gives immediate reassurancea problem does arise with your pet.At Dunedin Vets, we offer free puppy and kitten checks and for all new pets as soon as you acquire them this may be carried out by telephone during these Covid- times. Lots of advice is given by vets, qualied veterinary nurses and reception staff.Everyone is thinking about vaccination against coronavirus for humans just now. Vaccination has been the major controller of lethal diseases since the process was developed by Edward Jenner centuries ago.We must vaccinate our pets to prevent several fatal conditions. Pups can be vaccinated from six weeks of age. However, vaccinating at  and  weeks of age is the new normal during this Covid- pandemic, when most vaccinations are given.Pups should be kept isolated until two weeks after the first vaccination, then limited contact with other dogs until after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis leptospirosis and kennel cough.It is advisable to vaccinate your kitten against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia. Two vaccines are usually given three weeks apart from nine weeks of age. Kittens should be kept isolated until one week after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains. One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-29-31-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoPLEASE drink up... the pub is on firersquo was a headline in the East Lothian Courier on December , .Time was called early at the Auld Hoose pub in North Berwick last Wednesday after a fire broke out in the public bar.Customers spotted smoke coming from the floor near a fireplace about pm and the local fire brigade was alerted.The premises were evacuated ndash including an upstairs flat occupied by Jean Borthwick and her Labrador dog, Freeway ndash as landlord Ian McMinn tried to tackle the blaze with a fire extinguisher containing powder.But help was soon at hand in the shape of his brother Hugh, a local fireman, and the rest of the retained crew who began fighting the dense smoke and flames.Sub-officer McMinn explained that cracks in the old hearth at the pubrsquos real fire had caused joists and beams on the floor to burn.AN EAST Lothian pupil became the first from his high school to be accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .Ian Graham, son of Sergeant and Mrs Graham, Tranent, has been accepted for entry into Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in October .Ian is at present in his sixth year at the Ross High School.He was Dux of the School in his fth year and is at present Head Boy.He is a young man of high intellectual ability but at the same time he is an accomplished games player, playing in the School XV and also in the Badminton Club.He is an office-bearer in the Literary and Debating Society and last summer was a gold medallist in athletics at the Scottish Schools Athletics Championships.A MAN was fined pound after being caught stealing a bird from a train station, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .In the Burgh Court, on Friday, before Bailie Main, James Kelly, railway porter, Church Street, Haddington, pleaded guilty to having, on Tuesday, st, stolen a cockerel from a hamper lying in the booking-hall of the station.The Fiscal stated that, about eight orsquoclock on the night in question, a booking-clerk heard a person entering the booking-hall on tip-toe.On going out, he found Kelly alongside the hamper.He made the excuse that the label had been torn off the hamper, and that he was putting it on.The label was afterwards found lying on the floor, but it was discovered that the hamper had been opened and the cockerel removed."},{"url":null,"title":"7am-wait-worth-mum-bonnie-babies-champion-2020-harris-tait","story":"Harris Tait, who celebrated his first birthday on December , was announced as the winner in last weekrsquos Courier.He lives on East Lintonrsquos Longstone Avenue with mum Kirsty, , and dad Andrew, , a maintenance team leader at Torness Power Station.Kirsty described Harris as a ldquofunny and cheeky little boy with ldquosuch a little personality.She added: ldquoHe knows what he wants and is a determined little guy, which I think he takes from me and Andrew.Kirsty, who has been on maternity leave this year but is ing to work on Monday as a customer trade manager at Asda in Livingston, said Harrisrsquo win had been a boost to the family after what has been a tumultuous year.She said: ldquoItrsquos not really been the greatest year and hersquos not been able to interact with other kids and I thought, lsquoWhat have we got to lose rsquo so decided to enter him.ldquoYou never think that you are going to win competitions like these.When the results were announced in last weekrsquos Courier, Kirsty said she was ldquobuzzing and ldquoa bit emotional.

And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high.

Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Anyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to twoweeks ago.Other restrictions will also come into effect includingplaces of worship closing,no wakes, two-metre distancing in canteens and further premises closing.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Grants areavailable for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lockdown-rules-scotland-covid-restrictions-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules on Monday afternoon, asthe latest restrictions came into effect from midnight today in all Level  areas of the country andwill continue throughout the month.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes.

Where  in modern society would this level of accident, injury and probable death be allowed without intervention by the Health and Safety Executive, and prosecution of those causing the hazard  Modern red deer numbers are four times higher than in my young days, kept so by landowners, and the animals are substantially less than wild now, human-familiar and sometimes human-fed. No wonder they are happy around our main roads ndash until hit.The best long-term solution, and probably the easiest short-term solution too, would be the re-introduction of a few wolf packs. The first effect of this would be to scare the deer off easy lower ground where they know they would be vulnerable to wolf attack. The killing of deer by their proper predators would be good for the herd in the longer term, with many wider benefits to the environment. Much evidence of this comes from the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone Park in the United States years ago a fascinating short film, How Wolves Change Rivers, can be found on YouTube showing the wider beneficial effects.There are around , wolves in Europe, rising year by year.

She then published a new Independence Referendum Bill.In March , the day before Article  on leaving the EU was passed by Parliament, the First Minister formally requested the consent of Westminster to hold a referendum on Scottish independence. Theresa May said: ldquonow is not the time. The SNP lost a third of its seats in the  snap election that followed.Undaunted, she unveiled a ldquoreset timetable for indyref  which was now scheduled for the autumn of . When that didnrsquot happen she moved the dial to the autumn of , but before that date the SNP switched to supporting a Peoplersquos Vote for Brexit instead of indyref. That didnrsquot happen either. Indeed, the Peoplersquos Vote turned into a Tory General Election landslide of December . A triumphant Boris Johnson announced that he was now Minister for the Union and would reject a Scottish independence referendum for ldquoa generation.Sturgeonrsquos latest forecast is for a referendum in the first half of the new Scottish parliamentary cycle ndash meaning sometime around . You might think that after all these  dawns, independence supporters would have lost hope ndash but not a bit of it. After every deadline has been missed, support for independence has eventually ticked up.More voters than ever appear to have been convinced that Scotland should be an independent country. Some  polls have shown a majority for Yes, reaching a peak of  per cent in a Savanta ComRes poll in mid-December.Of course, that poll excluded donrsquot knows, and all recent polls have been conducted under the shadow of Brexit and latterly the pandemic. It is dficult to know just how much of this is actual support for independence and how much is down to loathing of Boris Johnson and Brexit. However, any objective assessment of the polling evidence would have to conclude that independence is gradually becoming the settled will of the Scottish electorate.This doesnrsquot mean a referendum is in the bag or even that it will certainly take place. Personally, I think the odds of a legally-binding referendum being held in the next decade are fairly remote. This is because the Conservatives now have a very solid majority in Westminster, despite losing a raft of Scottish MPs in .Boris Johnson is triumphant after his Brexit deal and will argue that there is no justication for holding a ldquoisive referendum to break up Britain at the very moment the UK is going through the complex process of rebuilding after the twin shocks of Covid and Brexit.The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, is also of this view. He is promising further devolution instead of a referendum and has enlisted one of the stars of the  Better Together campaign, the former PM Gordon Brown, to front it. That is the surest sign that, unlike Jeremy Corbyn, Starmer is not prepared to flirt with independence.So, eventhe SNP win the expected landslide in the May Scottish elections, the prospect of Westminster agreeing a legally binding referendum on Scottish independence is remote.Nor will there be much enthusiasm in Brussels for Scottish secession, now that a Brexit deal is in place. Those politicians in the European Parliament who had been saying theyrsquod changed their minds about Scottish independence were mostly playing a tactical game to discredit Brexit. Countries like France and Spain are as resolutely opposed to ldquoseparatism as ever, and are not going to allow Brussels to get involved in the internal politics of a country no longer in the European Union.Nicola Sturgeon has always said that the independence referendum has to be ldquobeyond legal challenge ndash in other words, expressly authorised by Westminster through a Section  Order.She is not interested in declaring UDI after a General Election victory or staging a wildcat referendum of the kind held by Catalonia in . That led to the incarceration of many of the referendum organisers and the self-exile of the Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont.The First Minister is the queen of caution. But that doesnrsquot mean shersquoll do nothing. Her personal popularity has never been higher following her handling of the pandemic, and the SNP has a commanding lead in the opinion polls. The FM is fully aware of just how dficult it is to win an absolute majority in a proportional parliament.But she will probably secure the support of the Greens at Holyrood for a referendum.So what happens then  Joanna Cherry MP, one of the stars of the anti-Brexit court actions, hopes that she will take on the Westminster Government in the Supreme Court,Boris refuses to accept the Scottish Governmentrsquos ldquomandate for a referendum.It is clear, under the UK constitution, that Holyrood has no power to hold a legally binding referendum on independence, but that doesnrsquot mean it canrsquot hold a consultative or advisory ballot asking the Scottish people what they want.There is a chance that the courts would agree that Holyrood has the power to hold a nationwide opinion poll.But would that make any dference  The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, is promising to boycott any such advisory referendum and is calling on Unionists not to participate in it. Even some supporters of independence might think that now is just the wrong time to be holding a isive referendum. It could lead to a repeat of the Catalan situation in  when their referendum was condemned as unrepresentative because unionist voters refused to vote.Nationalists might say: a votersquos a vote andpeople donrsquot take the opportunity of expressing a view they canrsquot complain about the result.But it is not Holyrood they need to convince but Westminster. Boris Johnson would use a half-baked referendum result to rule out a referendum even more emphatically than before, and Keir Starmer would back him.We are in a strange limbo, therefore. There is no obvious reason to expect a Scottish referendum in the near future and yet almost everyone does. There is no politically plausible route. However, politics is very fluid right now. We live in turbulent times.Support is clearly rising and it may be that a mass movement of Scottish opinion exerts moral pressure on the Westminster establishment to change its mind.

It was last revalued by the trustees in .A full valuation was ldquoconsidered to be onerous compared to any benefits to be derived from it, principally due to the dficulty in establishing a value of enhancement resulting from the ownership by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, said the trust.ldquoThe valuation basis used by the trustees was the market value and the current trustee is content with the valuation and is not aware of any changes.The castlersquos furnishings were also revalued in  at pound, - again a full valuation was also considered ldquoonerous with the problem of calculating the value of the Queen Motherrsquos cache.Almost pound.m of the trustrsquos donations were funds restricted to a specic use.Though donors were not named, the multi-million pound, ten bedroom B and B, Granary Lodge, in the grounds was was funded by cash from The Gosling Foundation, American philanthropist Julia Irene Kauffman - the daughter of the late pharmaceutical magnate Ewing Kauffman - and investment financier Louis de Seacutegur de Charbonniegraveres and his we Priscilla.In , it was revealed that a wooded area near the castle had been renamed in honour of a wealthy Saudi businessman who reportedly donated pound, to its restoration.The woodland, located to the east of the th Century Castle of Mey, was renamed Mahfouz Wood in honour of Dr Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz.

In , to mark the th anniversary of the battle, Charles Dorville Pilkington Jacksons statue of Bruce was put in place and the same year saw the construction of the Rotunda. By this point, there were only two Borestone fragments remaining and they were removed and placed inside the new visitor centre for safe-keeping.In his online article, Mr Welsh highlights an account by a Robert White who saw the stone in  when he said it had been chipped around on every side by souvenir hunters and described its colour as blue, while an account in John Parkerrsquos  book ldquoHistoric Tales of the Wars of Scotland, Volume Two described it as a large piece of granite.Mr Parker wrote: ldquoThe stone bears the marks of many a ruthless pilgrimage, and in many parts it has been chipped off by thousands of persons who wanted to possess a piece of the relic.Meanwhile, in an account in , documented in a letter published in ious Scottish newspapers, a William Ireland wrote that he had visited the stone and many pieces were still being taken.He wrote that it was ldquogreenstone, or some similar igneous rock capable of taking a high polish. Ireland wrote of the souvenir hunters in the hope it would alert Scots to do something about it and protect the stone from trophy hunters.Mr Welsh said that letters were then sent in response to Mr Irelandrsquos words, explaining: ldquoOne correspondent didnrsquot think bits were being taken away as much as implied. All the communications demanded something be done about it and they blamed the landowner and the locals for the state of neglect. The enclosure subsequently rested on a concrete base.

At the same time, Mr Trump encouraged his supporters to show up in force for Georgiarsquos Tuesday contests. vw,vw,px, px\"Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Georgia ldquoYoursquove got to swarm it tomorrow, he told thousands of cheering supporters, downplaying the threat of fraud.Democrats must win both of the statersquos Senate elections to gain the Senate majority. The Senate would be equally ided -, with vice president-elect Kamala Harris serving as the tie-breaker for Democrats.Democrats secured a narrow House of Representatives majority and the White House during Novemberrsquos general election.Even a closely ided Democratic Senate is not likely to guarantee Mr Biden everything he wants, given Senate rules that require  votes to move most major legislation.ButDemocrats lose even one of Tuesdayrsquos contests, he would have little scope for his most ambitious plans to expand government-backed health care coverage, strengthen the middle class, address racial inequality and combat climate change.A Republican-controlled Senate also would create a rougher path for Mr Bidenrsquos cabinet picks and judicial nominees. vw,vw,px, px\"Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock during a campaign rally in Augusta ldquoGeorgia, the whole nation is looking to you. The power is literally in your hands, Mr Biden said at his own rally in Atlanta earlier on Monday.ldquoOne state can chart the course, not just for the next four years, but for the next generation.Georgiarsquos January elections, necessary because no Senate candidates won a majority of the general election votes, have been unique for many reasons, not least because the contenders essentially ran as teams, even campaigning together sometimes.One contest features Democrat Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor of the Atlanta church where murdered civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr grew up and preached.The -year-old black man was raised in public housing and spent most of his adult le preaching in Baptist churches.He is facing Republican senator Kelly Loeffler, a -year-old former businesswoman who was appointed to the Senate less than a year ago by the statersquos Republican governor.She is only the second woman to represent Georgia in the Senate, although race has emerged as a campaign focus far more than gender. Ms Loeffler and her allies have seized on some snippets of Mr Warnockrsquos sermons to cast him as extreme. vw,vw,px, px\"Kelly Loeffler with Donald Trump The other election pits -year-old former business executive David Perdue, who held the Senate seat until his term officially expired on Sunday, against Democrat Jon Ossoff, a former congressional aide and journalist.At  years old, Mr Ossoff would be the Senatersquos youngest memberelected. The fresh-faced Democrat rose to national prominence in  when he launched an unsuccessful House special election bid.Despite fears among some Republicans that Mr Trumprsquos baseless claims of voter fraud could depress turnout, the partyrsquos two candidates have pledged loyalty to the president.The results also will help demonstrate whether the sweeping political coalition that fuelled Mr Bidenrsquos victory was an anti-Trump anomaly or part of a new landscape.The Democrat won Georgiarsquos  electoral votes by about , ballots out of five million cast in November.Democratic success is likely to depend on driving a huge turnout of African Americans, young voters, college-educated voters and women, all groups that helped Mr Biden become the first Democratic presidential candidate since  to win Georgia.Republicans have been focused on energising their own base of white men and voters beyond the core of metro Atlanta.copy -.

Everybody needs to try and make this work and that includes the companies that can take away the charging for data, he said.This is information for parents and carers, pupils and college students about the national lockdown in England.More details: https:t.co IwumBJZRZ pic QZWLlomkpmdash Department for EducationJanuary , Mary Bousted, general secretary of the National Education Union , said it was down to the Prime Minister to push network operators to make data more affordable.ldquoWith child poverty figures on the rise, the challenge remains large ndash but action must be swt, immediate and game-changing, she said.ldquoWe must hear no more of rationing of equipment, as we did late last year. If the stockpiles exist, as the Department for Education claim they do, then they must be distributed urgently.ldquoWe have heard too many stories of requests from schools not being met, or not being fully met.ldquoWe must also see swt action to make internet connections and data allowance affordable for remote learning. This can only come from the top, with the Prime Minister speaking to communications companies and making that change immediately.On Monday, a letter sent to the Prime Minister from senior public figures including former education secretaries and former prime minister Tony Blair cites figures from Ofcom which estimate that between . million and . million children in the UKdo not have home access to a laptop, desktop or tablet, and that more than , children live in a household with only a mobile internet connection.And according to the communications regulatorrsquos Connected Nations report, published last month, around , properties across the UK cannot access a ldquodecent broadband connection.With the new lockdown underway, children need the tech  data capacity in place this week. Those children who havenrsquot got the tech should be offered a priority place in school from Monday. The alternative is that they are not able to learn which is just not acceptable.mdash Anne LongfieldJanuary , Anne Longfield, the Childrenrsquos Commissioner for England, said the Government needed to treat pupils without laptops and access to sufficient technology as a priority.She told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoThere is no doubt that remote learning and a large amount of time out of school has a very negative impact on children.ldquoRemote learning now needs to be a high priority for the Government and we need a plan around that to ensure there is consistency in what schools are able to offer but also that tech issue.ldquoA lot of pupils still donrsquot have laptops. They are surviving on broken phones ndash those children now need to be seen as a priority to get into the classroom and deemed to be a vulnerable child.ldquoThere is also the issue of the cost of data, and I think this is something that tech companies and broadband companies really need to step up to now.A number of technology providers have pointed to schemes they already have running to help disadvantaged pupils ndash Vodafone said its Schools.Connected initiative had so far distributed more than , SIM cards to primary and secondary schools across the UK in an effort to provide free connectivity to students.Vodafone also confirmed that it was in talks with the DfE about joining the GB free data-a-month scheme.While broadband provider Virgin Media launched an Essential broadband service late last year which it says offers a reliable and affordable internet connection to those facing financial dficulty.copy -.

Although transfer tests start this weekend, no announcement was made on Monday night.With all non-essential retail already closed, and ato school for thousands of children delayed, the Executive’s lockdown options are limited.The most recent plan was for primary pupils to be taught remotely for the week from January -, while for secondary school Years  to , remote learning is due to last for the entire month. Sources on Monday night indicated there would be an extended period of remote learning until February.Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said Health Minister Robin Swann and Education Minister Peter Weir would bring recommendations to an Executive meeting today about exams.Earlier, First Minister Arlene Foster had hinted at such a move.“If it’s the case that we need to close schools as we did in March last year I will deeply regret that,” she said. “But we will of course take whatever action is needed based on the medical evidence in front of us.”Boris Johnson’s announcement that pushing ahead with all exams in England this summer “as normal” would not be fair or possible also puts pressure on Mr Weir to postpone this weekend’s first transfer test for pupils hoping to attend grammar schools in Northern Ireland.Mrs O’Neill on Monday called for it to be abandoned. “The transfer tests should not proceed,” the Sinn Fein vice president said. “The Education Minister needs to act now.”It is understood that the two exams bodies that run the tests will make announcements on Tuesday. Mrs Foster said they were private bodies that make their own decisions, but will have to abide by health advice.Schools had already been advised by Mr Weir to have contingency plans ready should there be a need to cancel the tests.A Department of Education spokesperson said: “The minister has highlighted the need to ensure that all schools hosting the tests have carried out a full risk assessment and that the arrangements for the tests are compatible with public health guidance and public health legislation.“The minister has stressed that there cannot be any compromise to ensuring the safety of children and families.”But the Department added: “The minister has also highlighted the need for schools to ensure that contingency admissions criteria are in place in the event that entrance tests cannot be operated.”After his announcement on Monday night, the Prime Minister said the Government had been doing “everything in our power to keep schools open”.“The problem is not that schools are unsafe for children,” he said, adding that children are still very unlikely to be severely affected even by the new iant of Covid. But he said schools may act as “vectors for transmission”, causing the virus to spread.He added that all the devolved nations share his thoughts, and are taking similar steps.SDLP education spokesman Daniel McCrossan has now called on Mr Weir to follow suit.“The Prime Minister announced that all GCSE and A-Level exams have been cancelled in England,” he said.“It’s time Peter Weir made the same announcement and cancelled exams and the transfer test. The SDLP have been calling for exams to be cancelled for months. The minister must act.”Public sector union Nipsa last night called on Mr Weir to close schools “until they are safe”.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"VideoCoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Extended period of remote learning for schoolsThere will be an extended period of remote learning for schools in Northern Ireland, the Executive has said.

On the date she was detected speeding, May  of last year, the defendant already had nine penalty points on her licence.Mr Jack said his client now faced the possibility of being disqualied for six months. She is a nurse in the Covid ward in the Causeway Hospital, he said. On the date in question she was feeling unwell and went to Altnagelvin Hospital for a Covid test. Unfortunately the test proved to be positive and after receiving the result she became distracted when driving home and exceeded the speed limit.I spoke to the PPS and explained the background to them and askedthey could mark it by way of a caution rather than by proceeding with the case.But I was told the case had been allocated to a prosecutor and nothing could be done. I am concerned thatshe receives a y disqualication today that she will have dficulty in getting to and from her work.The judge said she would deal with the matter by way of a short disqualication today and disqualied the defendant from driving for three days and fined her £.Belfast Most ReadSammy Wilson defends Portrush visit after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Extended period of remote learning for schoolsCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates January DUP and Sinn Fein on collision course as O#Neill adamant weekend transfer tests should be droppedBelfast woman Lucy McIlhatton killed in Springfield Road crashLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland transfer tests cancelled and schools #closed to mid-term#Coronavirus Northern Ireland updates January Hit-and-run driver who crashed on M while high on cocaine disqualied for  monthsNumber of Westminster constituencies in Northern Ireland to remain at Northern Ireland constituency boundaries to change but it will still have  MPsLatest from Belfast England to gain  more MPs in boundary shake-up before  electionApplications for mortgage exceptions expected to surge to record levelsLondon-listed Hipgnosis buys catalogue of ex-Fleetwood Mac guitarist BuckinghamDeath to  review: ‘The script is so embarrassingly lame it’s in urgent need of a pair of crutches’Sturgeon urges people to stay at home as mainland Scotland s to lockdown,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

After the most dficult of  months, Jon Tonge rates our ministers.Arlene Foster: First MinisterThis was the First Minister#s best year in a while, although that may damn with faint praise.Mrs Foster got her job back, devolution was restored, she sailed through the RHI inquiry report and earned praise even beyond her community for Covid consistency.Then her party bizarrely forced a cross-community vote against lockdown before agreeing to tougher restrictions within a fortnight. That at least united lockdown zealots and sceptics in anger and bafflement.Brexit yielded an Irish Sea border, and many blamed the DUP as midwives of their misfortune.Arlene nonetheless celebrated five years as DUP leader, most spent not dealing with Sammy Wilson or Edwin Poots.She was also confronted by the biggest rebellion in DUP history as  MLAs refused to support their leader on the Executive Functions Bill.Yet all the endless talk of leadership challenges remains just that - chatter. Foster remains the undisputed leader of unionism as her beloved country enters its centenary. Michelle O#Neill: Deputy First MinisterPaid a price for attending what seems the longest funeral in history, given the arguments it still attracts.Having survived a curious party leadership challenge from John O#Dowd in , the Deputy First Minister began the year promisingly. Sinn Fein#s quiet compromise on a standalone Irish Language Act helped facilitate New Decade, New Approach and theof Stormont.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMichelle O#NeillPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMichelle O#Neill Via existing legislation, Irish language provision was to be extended and a dedicated commissioner appointedO#Neill#s party got most of what it wanted, on terms nonetheless acceptable to the DUP. O#Neill#s pronouncements on the need for an all-island strategy to deal with Covid made good sense. But at the end of June came that funeral furore. This extended even beyond those whose views on republican commitments to public safety were shaped by an earlier era.We did not really miss the joint briefings from the First and Deputy First Minister. Loveless marriages on public show are not a great watch. But their absence symbolised the void in joined-up government. And no one was surprised when Michelle found  reasons why she was unable to attend Arlene#s big centenary party next year.For the Deputy First Minister, the hope is to seize the main office in . Sinn Fein#s strong performances in the South increase expectations, and pressure, on its northern leader. Robin Swann: HealthThe lockdown king had a strong year, commanding respect across the political spectrum. LucidTalk surveys showed most of the public backed tough Covid restrictions. Swann immunised Northern Ireland from the wildlyoptimisticus virus strain offered by the Prime Minister.The Health Minister must have had moments of regret at choosing the one job more taxing than his former role leading the UUP. Still, such experience helped with the crisis management.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRobin SwannMichael Cooper FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueRobin Swann Northern Ireland#s NHS crisis long pre-dated Covid, shocking testimony to the three-year absence of devolved government. Swann helped prevent total collapse and quickly settled the health workers# strike.Critics suggested Swann was optimism#s antidote. They criticised his early warning that , might die as alarmist, % beyond the actual toll. There remained concern over whether the Covid focus was at the expense of other treatments. Businesses raged against stop-start lockdowns. Van Morrison declined the invitation to the Swann Christmas household bubble. Ironically, Swann ended the year being criticised for being too soft in not imposing a travel ban from Britain.But overall, no one could accuse Swann of swerving science or ducking extraordinarily dficult challenges. Edwin Poots: AgricultureAppeared at times a masked version of Sammy Wilson in terms of lockdown scepticism and leadership challenges.In an extraordinary scientic breakthrough in October, Poots seemed to discover a mutant strain of the virus in which transmission in nationalist areas exceeded that in unionist communities by six to one.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEdwin Poots FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueEdwin Poots When sticking to his agriculture brief, Poots is well regarded as a capable and often conciliatory minister who listens and engages.

Peter Weir: EducationSometimes seemed so keen on keeping children in school at all costs you half-expected them to be in class on Christmas Day morning. But it#s a strange world when an Education Minister - or Under-fire Education Minister, to give Peter Weir his full title for most of the year - gets criticised for wanting children to go to school.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePeter Weir FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePeter Weir Arguments over transfer test locations at least deflectedfrom the age-old battle about the tests themselves. Public opinion is evenly ided. Those whose kids are most likely to pass are most in favour of the tests, funnily enough. Such arguments will persist long beyond the DUP minister#s tenure.An Arlene loyalist, Weir deserves credit for wanting to keep education as normal as possible. He recognised that remote learning experiences y wildly and disadvantage most those in greatest need. Nonetheless, January classes in school look unlikely. Expect his decision to persist, with some GCSE and A-level examinations next summer to come under further pressure. Another climbdown seems likely. Nichola Mallon: InfrastructureThis ought to be one of the more attractive Executive posts, allowing strategic development.

Diane Dodds: EconomyAttempted valiantly to keep alive an economy potentially suffering more damage from lockdowns than  years of the Troubles.

Barman Andy Nutt is preparing to pour the last measure at the well-known local pub.Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Dec   addthis, Knobbsrsquo Tavern closed in March, just before the pandemic arrived. In the week leading up to its final hurrah, we caught up with barman Andy Nutt and a few regulars.A well-known County Derry pub that has been in operation since  will close its door for the final time on Thursday.Knobbs’ Tavern in Kildoag, between Claudy and Donemana, was originally a grocery store that serviced the local area, but the community it sustained has been shrinking.On Saturday, they held a packed farewell concert, and when the County Derry Post caught up with a few of the regulars on the Friday afternoon, they were in reflective mood.“We’ll miss the yarns and the company,” said previous owner, Jack Knobbs, who was perched at the corner of the bar with his dog, Honey.“It was originally what they call a licensed shop and the first time it was opened as a bar was in . Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.” googletag.cmd.push Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. googletag.cmd.push  “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed. “It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!     “I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble. “I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above. There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil discoThe Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. googletag.cmd.push “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” googletag.cmd.push As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us.     “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. googletag.cmd.push The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. googletag.cmd.push By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore.     “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Colette Rogers, Strategic Lead for Tobacco Control with the PHA, said: “During the COVID- pandemic, our health is more important than ever. Stopping smoking now will have a positive impact on your health, not only in the long-term, but also sooner in ways you probably hadn’t thought about. For example,you smoke, your fingers are in contact with your lips, increasing the possibility of transmission of COVID- from hand to mouth. “This has been a dficult year in lots of ways, but you can use the New Year as an opportunity to take a positive step to quit smoking and make use of our free support services to help. googletag.cmd.push “Due to the present COVID- situation we have put plans in place to ensure you can access PHA-funded Stop Smoking Services while still following social distancing guidelines,” said Colette. “This may include telephone contact or video calls as opposed to face-to-face support. These measures will ensure you can still access Stop Smoking Services in a manner which is safe and convenient for you.” Studies have shown that you are four times more likely to quit with help. Local Stop Smoking Services, nicotine replacement therapyand support from your family and friends can make all the dference when you are quitting, so make sure you are familiar with all the help available. googletag.cmd.push “We know quitting smoking isn’t easy and it can take several attempts for many people to quit for good, butyou are determined you can do it,” said Colette. “There is lots of help available to support you to quit. If you have tried to quit before and relapsed, accept it, work out why it happened, and focus on how you can avoid it happening again. If you found you have relapsed due to the dficulty and stress of the pandemic, remember the positives. You have quit before and you can do it again! “We would encourage people to take the time to look at our website at www.stopsmokingni.info.     As well as support and advice, you will find real le stories of people in Northern Ireland who have quit successfully. You can get insight from their experience and what has motivated them as you consider your smoke free choices this New Year.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson said she is to meet the Norths Minister for Sport this week to discuss the proposal. The talks with Minister Deirdre Hargey take place on Wednesday amid mounting support for soccer to be reorganised on an all-island basis. The Foyle MLA said: “The past year has been hugely damaging for all sports, given the loss of gate receipts and other revenues. “Having two soccer federations on an island this size never made commercial or sporting sense and there had already been signicant support, North and South, for existing proposals to create an all-island structure. googletag.cmd.push “However, in the wake of the Covid pandemic and the impact it has had on the game, more and more soccer clubs are assessing their long-term sustainability and finding that the appeal of an all-Ireland league is obvious. “Structured proposals are already in place and signicant progress has been made regarding potential sponsorship of an all-island league. “It is also abundantly clear from the success of other all-Ireland sports such as rugby, boxing, golf, GAA, hockey and cricket that we can achieve great things when we work on an all-island basis. “This should not be a politically sensitive issue but rather one of what makes best economic and sporting sense to soccer clubs throughout the island. googletag.cmd.push That is the basis on which we will pursue our discussions with the minister and as we continue to progress this issue in the time ahead.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half. I canrsquot praise the boys enough, our bench helped us over the line and it was a superbly taken goal from Francis.Meath: J Fagan, R Ennis, H Cottrell, E Cole, P Connelly, J Coyne, K OrsquoGorman, J Cole , E Grehan, R Byas , J Meagher , S Donnelly, R Fagan , J Harris, S Cunningham .Subs: M Cullyfor Harris, E McCormack for Donnelly, D Darby for Cunningham.Down: P Smyth, J Higgins, D Mallon, J McCollum, N Kelly, C Savage, F McFall, R OrsquoNeill, J Duggan, F Turpin , T McGrattan , M Dorrian , O Coulter , J Clarke, F Caldwell .Subs: S Milliganfor OrsquoNeill, F MacManus for McGrattan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan woman’s releases debut children’s book  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman has joined the ranks of childrenrsquos book authors.Kathleen McPolin, who is a Speech and Language Therapy Assistant in Downpatrick SureStart, has just published the first in an exciting new series featuring the farm-based adventures of Boomer and Blanky.Produced by Shanway Press in Belfast, the books are aimed at encouraging early yearsrsquo interest in reading and promote new vocabulary.Part of Kathleenrsquos work with SureStart over the past  years has been helping to facilitate rhythm, rhyme, and story sessions each week for children - with their parents or s.ldquoBecause this age group have short attention spans, I find the books that really capture their attention are the colourful ones with few words but yet have a story to tell, explained Kathleen.After finding it dficult to get the right books to cover everyday topics such as transport, weather, clothes, and food in a short-story style, Kathleen decided to create her own.ldquoChildren love to see the same characters appear regularly in their books.

He had lived in London most of his le, leaving Saul at the age of .Engaged to be married, but struggling to find the right ring, he found himself back in Northern Ireland on business he decided to call on his uncle Will, his only surviving Irish relative.It was the eve of the longest night of the year, a few days before Christmas, and a bitterly cold late afternoon. On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door. She ripped of her shoe and attacked the window screen. She turned to Jim. lsquoWhat do you know about fixing cars rsquo Jim shrugged.The bride pierced him with fiery blue eyes.lsquoAre you going to a fancy dress party rsquo he asked. lsquoI am going to be married,rsquo she replied. She banged the roof of the car with her shoe a number of times, hopping about attempting to put the shoe back on to her foot. lsquoLet me give you a lt,rsquo suggested Jim.In order to steady herself the bride hung on to Jimrsquos shoulder and finally won the battle of the shoe. lsquoThought yoursquod never ask.rsquo She lashed out at the motor with her fist, missed, spun around and fell into Jimrsquos arms.Saul Church was only a mile away. The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man. The bride jumped to her feet. Well done.rsquo She kissed him on the nose. lsquoItrsquos a lovely ring,rsquo said an embarrassed Jim. lsquoI am engaged, havenrsquot got the ring yet.rsquoThe bride grabbed the ring and placed it on to her finger lsquoThen you had best get a move on, you donrsquot want to lose her.rsquo She took out a hanky and blew her nose with considerable force.Jim noticed in the torch light that she was muddy and dishevelled, her face and red hair littered with spots of mud.lsquoYou donrsquot have a driver rsquo he asked. lsquoSmelly little man, didnrsquot trust him, kicked him out a mile or so back,rsquo she replied. Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring. Where did you get yours rsquo Jim inquired.                                                                    lsquoYou like it rsquo asked his odd passenger as she struggled in vain to apply lipstick. Jim smiled and nodded his head. The bride inspected her ring lsquoItrsquos very nice, expensive,rsquo she boasted. lsquoWas it handed down through your fianceacutersquos family rsquo The bride didnrsquot reply. lsquoI live in London, I am visiting my uncle Will, do you know him, Will OrsquoBrien rsquoJim noticed that the young lady was gazing out of the window, looking slightly lost, she was not in the mood for conversation. The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding. She and he didnrsquot hit it off.rsquoUncle Will poked the dying embers of the fire. lsquoHe wasnrsquot one for bathing,rsquo he mumbled under his breath.lsquoShe died a few hours ago.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

The pupils I spoke to were confident and articulate users of the digital resources at their disposal. The school has developed effective support links during the pandemic to support distance learning.St Josephrsquos also received a special recognition badge last month for Cyber Resilience and Internet Safety, becoming the third primary school in Northern Ireland to be awarded this badge.The school had completed a pioneering education initiative developed to encourage online safety and cyber resilience amongst pupils in schools.The assessment report noted: lsquoSt Josephrsquos is a dynamic school which has a careful, considered and planned approach to developing and delivering a safe and secure digital technology learning environment for their pupils and have fully engaged their parental community in this development.rsquoPrincipal Laura Fitzsimons said: ldquoWe are delighted to have been awarded these prestigious titles which highlight the schoolrsquos continual investment in resources and training.ldquoWe are very pleased and proud of our teachers, student digital leaders and all our pupils for their commitment to digital learning.ldquoIt was particularly pleasing to receive this positive news in light of the challenging times which we are currently living in..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Talking.jpg","title":"Talking about coercive control  ","story":"TODAY there are mothers and their children from the wider Downpatrick area living in refuges run by Womenrsquos Aid.There may be more over the Christmas and New Year period as the festive time can be a dangerous time for people living with their abuser.The prospect of a six-week lockdown means that demand for help is also set to increase as Womenrsquos Aid supported , women and children during the last lockdown.Eileen Murphy, chief executive officer of the charity, has in her -plus years of working provided support to women from the Downpatrick area.Based in Newry, she works closely with the South Eastern Domestic Violence Partnership run by the local Health Trust and in partnership with other agencies, including the PSNI.ldquoOur refuges run at % capacity but we also work with many women who never stay in our refuges, said Eileen.She is all too aware of the worry and fear that some women will be experiencing over the holiday period.ldquoMothers will be trying to make the best Christmas Day possible for their children, no matter the situation. They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence. When itrsquos over he will say it was the drink or whatever. But I always say to that isI woke up tomorrow morning to see my partner battered or bruised and he told me I had done it last night with drink in me, would I take a drink again  Yet these guys continue to do it.ldquoThere is no doubt about that we work with traumatised women and children and people try and deal with it in many dferent ways.

Engraving by David Edwin sIto the account of Dr Crawford again today because there was a reference in it to Francis Rynd - “the Irish inventor of the hypodermic needle.” As you read this page, the roll-out of vaccinations here and around the UK has reached enormous proportions, with the figures rising fast and burgeoning rapidly in other countries too. And all of this is all possible because of an Irish physician, Francis Rynd, born in Dublin in .Some biographers focus on Rynd’s student days in Trinity College Dublin, where he was apparently regarded as ‘wayward’, preferring his hectic social leto his medical studies. \"Alexander WoodThe Lancet, one of the world’s most authoritative medical journals, reveals the historic signicance of Francis Rynd’s medical innovation which has made today’s massive vaccination programme possible. According to the Lancet, Rynd “made subcutaneous injections” to a woman patient in  for neuralgia , using a ‘syringe’, described as a “slender trocar and cannula” - a metal awl for cutting into the skin and a hollow tube.“It was inserted subcutaneously,” the Lancet recounts, “and the trocar retracted by means of a spring. Narcotic liquid descended from the hollow handle into the puncture site as the instrument was withdrawn.”At the time Francis Rynd was a surgeon in Dublin’s Meath Hospital , and was treating a woman who had suffered for years with severe neuralgic pain in her face. \"Report on Rynds Procedure in The Dublin Medical Press She’d been prescribed a solution of morphine, taken by mouth, to kill the pain, but this had failed miserably. Rynd decided to try putting the morphine directly under her skin, close to her facial nerves.He designed his innovative hypodermic needle and on June ,  performed the world’s first ever subcutaneousinjection, basically giving his patient what today would be regarded as a powerful local anaesthetic.His syringe incorporated two standard medical implements - a trocarto puncture the skin on the woman’s face, and a cannulawhich allowed the morphine to flow under her skin. In an article headline “Neuralgia, Introduction of Fluid to the Nerve” published in  in the Dublin Medical Press, Mr Rynd was reported to have said that after the procedure the woman slept well for the first time in months.For six years previously, after falling off a wall, -year-old Margaret Cox had been in acute pain “over the entire left side of her face…shooting into the eye, in the cheek, along the gums of both upper and lower jaw.” The Dublin Medical Press described Hynd’s procedure - “a solution of fteen grains of acetate of morphia, dissolved in one drachm of creosote, was introduced to the supra-orbital nerve, and along the course of the temporal, malar, and buccal nerves, by four punctures of an instrument made for the purpose. In the space of a minute all painhad ceased, and she slept better that night than she had for months.”Surgeon Rynd’s new procedure was soon used widely to treat pain and was championed around the world as “the greatest boon to medicine since the discovery of chloroform”. Florence Nightingale benefited from it herself during an illness and declared: “Nothing did me any good, but a curious little new-fangled operation of putting opium under the skin, which relieved [the pain] for  hours.”But it was an Edinburgh physician called Alexander Woodwho was first to properly publish an academic paper on the subcutaneous therapeutic injection of drugs in . He used one of the “elegant little syringes constructed … by Mr Ferguson of Giltspur Street”, and was thus championed as the inventor of the hypodermic syringe. In Rynd’s initial design, the liquid being injected simply flowed slowly out of the needle under gravity. In  a plunger was added to the syringe, allowing for a faster injection, directly into a vein, against the flow and pressure of the blood. So Francis Rynd should also be thanked for making blood tests possible - the addition of the plunger allowed the taking of blood samples, which could then be subjected to diagnostic tests. After his invention became a vital tool in hospitals and surgeries Rynd became an important figure on both the Irish medical and social scenes.A history of the Meath Hospital and County Dublin Infirmary published in  records that “Francis Rynd was a perfect gentleman, and had very polished manners he mixed in the best society, had most of the nobility in Ireland among his patients, dressed most fashionably, and was a great favourite with the ladies.”Francis Rynd died in Dublin in .   \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularDays after Brexit, many products vanish from Sainsbury’s in Northern Ireland and are replaced with Spar brandNI weather alert - sub-zero temperatures of -°C in next  hours as Met Office issues yellow status weather warning for Northern IrelandIs the ‘Beast from the East’ set to  Sympathy expressed after young female pedestrian Lucy McIlhatton is killed on major NI roadInjured motorist rushed to Royal Victoria Hospital after collision between van and lorry in busy NI roadMost PopularTributes pour in for brave Jade Caughey -‘our hearts are broken’- friends invited to pay last respects as funeral cortege passes on FridayMajor NI road now reopened after being closed in both direction during PSNI enquiryFULL statement released by NI Executive after last night’s emergency meeting on Coronavirus regulationsAlex Kane: Unionists must understand UK priorities to avoid ‘betrayal’NI hospital ‘extremely busy’ - patients asked to ‘Phone First’                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-lhVmIH sc-bYSBpT cqvPrG\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleEating OutChristmasCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlesCoronavirusGetting outMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help.

In these woods live Barbastelle and Bechsteinrsquos bat, and rare birds like lesser redpoll, lesser spotted woodpecker and woodcock.The Vale council is currently consulting the public on the proposals. The consultation runs until December , after which the council will consider what to do next mdash potentially drawing up a full business case for the new road.Coed Cadw is encouraging people to register their concerns about the loss of ancient woodland on their website, with six days left to register objections.A spokesman for the Vale of Glamorgan council said: ldquoNo decisions have been made on this matter, which is currently the subject of public consultation.Natalie ButtrissldquoEarly in the new year, a consultation report will be presented to cabinet and a decision taken on next steps.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local community\"The increasing numbers of Covid- case numbers across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan Health Board area could not be any more serious or alarming.Therefore, this message needs to be acted upon urgently and be seen as a warning to each and every one of us about the seriousness of the health situation we are all now facing.If current projections continue, then by Christmas week we will be seeing more than four times the number of new infections each day, than we were seeing at the start of December. These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This means it will have few storage and transportation issues, making it much easier to use in community settings such as care homes and primary care settings like GP surgeries.Wales health minister Vaughan Gething said: ldquoWe understand there are high expectations and excitement at the arrival of a second vaccine. However it will take time to reach everyone as this is not an instant fix. We wonrsquot receive all the doses at once and we have to be realistic about the scale and pace of delivery when we are vaccinating the entire adult population.ldquoWe will not see the impact of the vaccine for some months and the pressure on the NHS will continue during this winter.

To help the NHS to help you please wait to be invited for your vaccination.Senior responsible officer for Walesrsquo Covid- vaccine programme Dr Gillian Richardson said: ldquoThe vaccine has been approved as safe and effective by the MHRA, based on the same high standards as applied to all medicines and vaccines.ldquoIt is great news that a second vaccine has met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the MHRA.Dr Nicola Williams, director of support and delivery at Health and Care Research Wales, which is nationally co-ordinating research and study-set up in Wales, said: ldquoOur research community is working hard to provide the evidence we need to fight this pandemic and the approval of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is an important step forward. We have two further vaccines being tested in Wales right now, with more trials due to be set up in the coming weeks and months.ldquoThis research, alongside the other Covid- studies taking place will help us to not only protect the most vulnerable but also to provide the best care possible for those who become ill.ldquoIrsquom proud of the role our researchers in Wales have played in this UK-wide effort and I would like to thank the participants too who have volunteered.

At the same time, Mr Trump encouraged his supporters to show up in force for Georgiarsquos Tuesday contests. vw,vw,px, px\"Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Georgia ldquoYoursquove got to swarm it tomorrow, he told thousands of cheering supporters, downplaying the threat of fraud.Democrats must win both of the statersquos Senate elections to gain the Senate majority.

The fresh-faced Democrat rose to national prominence in  when he launched an unsuccessful House special election bid.Despite fears among some Republicans that Mr Trumprsquos baseless claims of voter fraud could depress turnout, the partyrsquos two candidates have pledged loyalty to the president.The results also will help demonstrate whether the sweeping political coalition that fuelled Mr Bidenrsquos victory was an anti-Trump anomaly or part of a new landscape.The Democrat won Georgiarsquos  electoral votes by about , ballots out of five million cast in November.Democratic success is likely to depend on driving a huge turnout of African Americans, young voters, college-educated voters and women, all groups that helped Mr Biden become the first Democratic presidential candidate since  to win Georgia.Republicans have been focused on energising their own base of white men and voters beyond the core of metro Atlanta..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Polls open in Georgia with Senate majority at stake article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If the stockpiles exist, as the Department for Education claim they do, then they must be distributed urgently.ldquoWe have heard too many stories of requests from schools not being met, or not being fully met.ldquoWe must also see swt action to make internet connections and data allowance affordable for remote learning. This can only come from the top, with the Prime Minister speaking to communications companies and making that change immediately.On Monday, a letter sent to the Prime Minister from senior public figures including former education secretaries and former prime minister Tony Blair cites figures from Ofcom which estimate that between . million and . million children in the UKdo not have home access to a laptop, desktop or tablet, and that more than , children live in a household with only a mobile internet connection.And according to the communications regulatorrsquos Connected Nations report, published last month, around , properties across the UK cannot access a ldquodecent broadband connection.With the new lockdown underway, children need the tech  data capacity in place this week.
