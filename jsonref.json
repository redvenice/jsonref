It’s hard to not think about the border when you live here’I have photographed these sisters, Sam and Lizzy, many times, in many costumes, over many years. This was a particularly difficult time in my life. It was late February, and my mum had been killed in a car crash the September before. After she died, I just wasn’t interested in photography. My mother had liked to sew when I was young, so instead I started cutting up old clothes or using scraps to make crude flags. I was just trying to make sense of what was happening in my world. I thought I might use them as props in the future.I was also going for daily walks with my dog, and a few houses down the road I came across this bizarrely tied-together pegboard fence. I see things cinematically. Bits of stories emerge from whatever I’m looking at. This image came from me sitting at my mother’s sewing machine, sewing those flags, and then finding that fence. I called up Sam and Lizzy and said: “I really need to do a picture – I need you to come over.”I’ve been collecting uniforms for a long time. I link it to my mother and my Roman Catholic upbringing, and the fact that we’re from a military family – my dad was a pilot. There was always a uniform tucked around somewhere. The ceremony, the iconography, the formality all appealed to me. This shot wasn’t so much about the specific uniform the girls are wearing, but the palette of those red jackets against that pink fence.It was the middle of winter, on a day that had started out cloudy but then we got this really nice band of light. I love how alike the girls look. They’re a year apart, but even their mother couldn’t tell who was who in the picture. They’re not professional models, but I knew I could do something interesting with them. I didn’t realise why at the time, but I needed a sense of forward movement in the poses they struck. My mother was on my mind on the day of the shoot. “It’s time,” she’d say, “time to do what you do.” She was always creative, and very encouraging. After the shoot, because I wasn’t really working, I had the luxury of being able to spend several months manipulating the image, printing and reprinting it. I was thinking about Velázquez and working on the lights and darks – the different blacks, in particular.This was in the months leading up to to the 2016 election. I’m from Texas, and I split my time between Dallas and Marfa, which is about 60 miles from the Mexican border. It’s hard to not think about the border when you live here. This image might not be a traditional version of what Texas looks like, but to me it is quite Texan, at least in my fantasy world.I started thinking about the role fantasy plays in everything – identity politics, cultural pluralism, nationalism – and these blended geographic areas that are constantly changing. I started researching the archetypes of the wild west and how they were interpreted by the Italians and the Spanish in spaghetti westerns. I watched a lot of Sergio Leone movies – I must have rewatched the last 10 minutes of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 100 times – and listened to Quentin Tarantino interviews. And so this image launched an entire project, a contemporary staged spaghetti western, entitled Smoke Bombs and Border Crossings, which featured three main archetypal characters: the military soldier, the American cowboy and the Mexican charro, or traditional horseman.I’ve had such a strange few years. I had my own car wreck last year, very close to where my mother died. I broke both legs, in several places, and an arm. I was sort of in that same kind of mental state, where I have had to put down my camera, but I’m getting to the point where I can pick it up again. I’m trying to be brave enough to. People ask you when you’re going to be better. You’re not better, you’re just different. I’m getting on with it, handling my life day by day, trying to make images in a new way.Influences: “So many … Travel, my mom, of course, Stephen Shore, Ana Mendieta, Henry Darger, Velázquez, anything that’s in the Prado museum in Madrid.”High point: “This picture being in the National Portrait Gallery.”Low point: “There are a lot of low points when you’re an artist.

It has been plagued by compromises since architect Jørn Utzon’s walkout in 1966Significant buildings generate their own mythology. For the Sydney Opera House, the story that the Unesco world heritage-listed design was fished out of a rejection pile before being declared a work of genius is a pleasing fable, despite its dubious origins.What is not in dispute is that the clashes that plagued the Opera House’s origins have reverberated – not always pleasingly – down the decades. The ambition of the Danish architect Jørn Utzon’s design, his walkout mid-project, and Peter Hall’s subsequent takeover in 1966 resulted in compromises that have bedevilled the building ever since.Now, as part of a five-year program in which the Opera House has been progressively upgrading its core infrastructure, construction is about to begin on a $150m revamp of its largest performance space, the 2,500-seat concert hall, designed to remedy the shortcomings born of the project’s messy origins.The irony of the Sydney Opera House is that it has become an international cultural landmark for the way it looks, rather than for being “the best opera house that can be built”, as the New South Wales premier Joe Cahill hoped when he launched the design competition in 1954.It is very far from the best in the eyes, and ears, of some who have experienced it at close quarters. The actor John Malkovich once said the acoustics in the concert hall “would do an aeroplane hangar a disservice”. Members of the resident Sydney Symphony Orchestra have long complained that they cannot hear their fellow musicians on stage. And the rise of the rock concert has further challenged the venue, with amplified music and electronic sets being precisely the opposite of what the hall’s infrastructure was built to accommodate.That concept was thrown out midway through construction – after Utzon’s enraged departure – and the objectives of the building’s two main venues were switched. Operas and plays were moved to the smaller Joan Sutherland theatre, where rigging was installed to support theatrical performances, and the concert hall was decked out for classical music instead, the justification being that symphonies would be more popular.But, at 45 metres, the concert hall is at least 10 metres longer than most acoustic-oriented spaces, and double the optimum height. As a consequence, much effort has gone into compensating for its cavernous proportions, including wood-panelled walls to aid reverberation, and fibreglass acoustic reflectors hung from the roof to create a sonic ceiling.But in the years since it was built interest in symphonies has been challenged by the ubiquity of pop, hip-hop and rock. While rock bands – including Massive Attack and the National – are often set up in the outdoor forecourt, acts including Lizzo, Interpol, Nick Cave, Iggy Pop, the Wu-Tang Clan, José González and Hot Chip have played the concert hall.They take some wrangling.“The shows that we currently put in there were never in the initial scope for the hall,” says Andrew Mackonis, Sydney Opera House’s production manager. He leads a team of nine.“Essentially it’s designed to be a big echo chamber, and that’s the opposite of what you want when you’re doing an amplified event,” he says. “You want the space to be as dead as possible. You have these two diametrically opposed ideals.”The space has had multiple smaller upgrades along the way to help it cope, including a high-quality PA system being installed and heavy drapery created to hang over the wood panelling. But the process of getting the hall ready for an amplified show is cumbersome – the drapes alone take hours to install – and the PA system is long past its prime.The other problem is weight. Contemporary musicians, especially dance acts, will often tour with complicated sets – big LED walls and lots of light production, in addition to their sound requirements. That all has to hang off the roof – which at the moment can only support 10 tonnes.“You could say we are the masters of the compromise,” Mackonis says. “Between budget, safety, timeline and the artistic values of the show that we’re putting in there, we are the ones who have to find the compromise.”He hopes the increased weight capacity of the roof – up to 38 tonnes when completed – will mean compromising fewer artistic visions, and that the new automatic drape system will cut down on pre-show manual labour.But that’s not all. The stage, which is now flat and fixed in height, obscuring the view from the stalls in favour of the boxes, will be put on multiple hydraulics. This will allow it to be elevated in sections, to give it the traditional orchestral horseshoe shape – helping the musicians to hear one another – or raised or lowered entirely if required. The boxes will be reoriented to reduce competition with the sightlines from the stalls, and more accessible seating and passageways will be installed.In measures aimed at further improving sound for classical performances, the fibreglass acoustic reflectors on the roof will be upgraded, and new wood panelling with a rippled surface will replace the flat timber walls, to give what Herron calls “a softer, more surrounding sound – a truer sound”.The singer Solange will perform the last concerts in the space this year on 31 January, though her health has reportedly reduced what was originally a four-night residency to two. Once the show is bumped out, the concert hall and sections of the viewing deck will be boarded up for a full two years while the work takes place.While some sections of the community may balk at the idea of a heritage venue hosting hip-hop artists and electronic dance acts – especially given the scale of the works required to accommodate them – Herron is firm about the necessity of the Opera House moving with the times.“The Opera House belongs to everyone,” she says. “The Opera House needs to cater to all of the community, not just certain sections of the community.”“We need to not only maintain our fabulous heritage but we need to be as prepared as we possibly can be for the next 50 years. What is it that audiences of now and the future are going to want and how can we best prepare the Concert Hall for that? That’s been the driving force behind our approach.”Herron says she expects the Opera House to take a $20m hit to its revenue during the concert hall’s closure, but believes that – as when its smaller venue, the Joan Sutherland theatre, closed for eight months for renewal works in 2017 – audiences will ultimately reap the rewards.“The Sydney Symphony Orchestra has wanted the concert hall acoustics to be improved since it opened,” she says. “You could say it’s a project that’s been in the works for 47 years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/614ea5ee6f0d855610a4a7a7656fdeaf4bd6a7a5/76_0_2839_1704/master/2839.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad0308dac0f6beeb1e859dd37d8cdfc9","title":"interest rates left at 075 amid hopes for uk economy","story":"Bank of England notes post-election surge in business confidence despite BrexitThe Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates on hold amid early signs of a rebound in the economy following Boris Johnson’s election victory.The MPC said the reduction in political uncertainty and the government’s plan to raise spending would probably boost economic growth over the months ahead.This was Mark Carney’s final rate-setting meeting before he stands down from Threadneedle Street in March. Carney will be replaced as governor by the head of the Financial Conduct Authority, Andrew Bailey.In a sign of the challenges that Britain still faces ahead of leaving the EU, two members of the Bank’s nine-strong MPC voted for an immediate cut in rates to provide additional support for households and businesses. In a repeat of their decision at last month’s meeting, Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel voted for lower borrowing costs.Despite leaving interest rates unchanged, Threadneedle Street warned that Britain’s departure from the EU would significantly downgrade the country’s ability to generate non-inflationary growth in future.The Bank said that productivity growth, a key measure of economic efficiency considered to be vital for improving living standards over the long term, would be damaged by tougher restrictions between Britain and the EU, even if the government secured a deep free trade agreement with Brussels.Johnson’s demand to complete trade talks by the end of this year will also concentrate the impact, rather than allowing the economy to gradually adjust to the new relationship with the EU.“Productivity growth might pick up a little from current rates, but was expected to remain subdued. That reflected how persistently weak productivity growth had been since the financial crisis, the consequences of the recent weakness in investment and the adjustments necessitated by Brexit,” the Bank added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2018a6d9e03f347f3ced1dae1d1a021aefd4675/0_117_3388_2033/master/3388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=119e6f441eba9c7dae252b9e34b1e90c","title":"pg tips and lipton tea poised for sale as young people switch to coffee","story":"Unilever considers sale as lukewarm sales hit household names such as Lyons, Brooke Bond and PukkaUnilever is considering selling its €3bn global tea business, which includes PG Tips and Lipton, after battling declining sales of traditional black tea for several years.The traditional cuppa has fallen out of favour in western markets such as the UK and US, particularly among younger people, who are more likely to drink coffee. Those who still drink tea prefer herbal, fruit and decaffeinated brews as part of the trend towards healthy eating and drinking.Black tea remains Britain’s favourite hot drink but the number of cups of tea brewed fell by 630m to 18.3bn in the year to February 2019, according to research firm Kantar.PG Tips has long been the market leader in the UK but was overtaken by Twinings, owned by Associated British Foods, for the first time last year. It was launched in 1930 by Brooke Bond and Company, a Manchester firm founded by the tea dealer Arthur Brooke, under the name “Pre-Gest Tea”, later becoming PG Tips. In 1960, it introduced tea bags which soon outsold loose leaf tea. The brand had annual sales of nearly £100m in the UK last year and is still made in Manchester.Unilever’s tea business is the biggest in the world, with brands such as Brooke Bond, Bushells, Lyons, Pure Leaf and Pukka. Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever’s chief financial officer, said the company was considering all options for the tea ision, including a total or partial sale and partnerships.The group has invested in premium black tea along with fruit and herbal variants. It said its herbal brand Pukka was performing well. It operates in almost 60 countries and has an annual turnover of nearly €3bn.Pitkethly said the tea business was similar in scale to the spreads business, which makes Flora and I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter and was sold by Unilever in 2017 to private equity firm KKR for €6.8bn. He said consumer goods companies must continually change their portfolios in response to changing consumer tastes.Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at trading platform Markets, said: “Surely the move to ever-greater coffee consumption in the west has been a drag on tea sales as we swap out our cup of Assam for giant mugs of Arabica. It comes not long after the disposal of the spreads business which similarly fell prey to changing consumer trends in developed markets.”Pitkethly said Unilever had held board meetings in the last two days to discuss the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China, which could be significant for global manufacturing, he said.

It’s just a new wave of shallow self-helpIf I have to hear one more astrologer telling me I am doing my best, I am going to lose it.We are living through an astrological boom, people keep telling us. There are many new books out on the subject there are celebrity astrologers there are half a dozen astrology apps with major VC investment every women’s media outlet from fashion magazines to Vice subsidiary Broadly has regular horoscope columns Prada, Versace and Gucci have released astrology-inspired fashion.And if you’re on social media, you’ve probably been attacked by astrology memes, where whole careers have been made from a person’s ability to tell you which character from the Netflix show You you are, based on your astrological sign. Oh my God, I’m such a Dottie! (Who the hell is Dottie, by the way?) Astrology is entering the mainstream.As someone who has studied astrology and the esoteric arts, I am here to give you my expert opinion on this trend: this has absolutely nothing to do with astrology. It’s just a new wave of self-help.Throughout history, astrology has been deeply intertwined with religion and spirituality – because its concerns were often religious and spiritual. How do I live a good life? Why am I suffering? What do the gods want from me? And yes, a lot of people just wanted to know when they were going to fall in love, and leaders like Elizabeth I and Ronald Reagan just wanted to know when it was the best time to go harass the poor people again, but every major religion has at one time or another used astrology to ease communication between earth and the heavens and show its followers where their free will collides with the vagaries of fate.Contemporary astrology has all the spiritual content of a feelgood Lizzo anthem – you know, the one where Lizzo allegedly stole a tweet from fellow female musician Mina Lioness and turned it into a lyric without attributing it, made a fortune off it, and then only after a year of hounding and some legal proceedings finally admitted she didn’t write her most famous hook.Divorced from its religious framework, then, astrology just becomes a form of self-help. How should I dress as an Aries rising? What music does my Scorpio sun want to listen to? And, as in self-help, everything bad that happens is just a lesson or an opportunity for growth. It’s the same line of thinking that gets you to “Cancer is a gift”. If you’re struggling financially, maybe you have some money karma to resolve. If you’re lonely, maybe you’re just not “showing up for yourself” romantically.The implication is that everything in your life is ultimately within your control it’s just a matter of working it the right way. Take, for example, the hottest new astrology book, Chani Nicholas’s You Were Born for This: Astrology for Radical Self-Acceptance (sigh).Nicholas is often credited with creating a new woke astrology. She runs workshops with names like “Self-Care Strategies for Crushing the Patriarchy” (sigh). She uses words like “capitalism” and “colonialism” in her horoscopes, yet her focus remains almost entirely on helping the inidual thrive under such conditions through changes of behavior.Pluto, god of the underworld, often represents the darker experiences, and a square is seen as a difficult aspect. Of my Pluto square sun, Nicholas writes: “You are someone who, if you chose to heal from your more harrowing Pluto experiences, is comfortable plumbing the depths of the psyche and soul. The kind of personal power this creates in you is undeniable.” Oh, well, if only I “chose” to “heal” sooner, maybe I would be rewarded with the riches and the blessings she speaks of throughout her book.This way of thinking, which was popularized by the New Age and Oprah industries, is pernicious in contemporary astrology. If you’re having a hard time, it is probably your fault. (It’s also a total misunderstanding of what Pluto actually does in a chart, which is more of a representation of the shadow side of society and cultural shifts controlled by the powerful, but sure, OK, whatever.)I’ve had an astrologer tell me that the reason I lost a job was because it wasn’t helping me “live out my higher purpose”. Well, it was helping me pay for groceries, so who cares about a higher purpose? This kind of thinking might be useful to the type of person who can pay hundreds of dollars for a private consultation with an astrologer. For those who are scraping by, however, it’s condescending and insulting.Nicholas might use terminology borrowed from astrology – like moon signs and sextiles and whatever – but ultimately she could be talking about Myers-Briggs or blood types or any other attempts to ide people into cohesive little groups. With so much of contemporary astrology focused on how each sign just is, perhaps it’s no wonder we’re starting to see discussion of whether or not it’s legal to discriminate against a specific astrological sign. (And anyway, a sun in Taurus is about understanding yourself through your good and painful experiences with Venusian values like beauty and money, but sure, OK, whatever.)A true astrological revival seems like it might be useful, because what astrology is really good at is bestowing and creating meaning. It’s not about truth, it’s not about destiny, it’s about finding meaning in your life through story and metaphor and reflection. It can help a person understand where the intersection lies between the inidual and the family, community and society exists and whether how that influence changes from positive to restrictive. It helps to bring a long-term perspective to changes, rather than keeping them in a sometimes terrifying present.Meaning, however, is not easily distilled into a 200-page book, and a search for meaning often leads us into the arms of predatory con artists, gurus and those trying to capitalize on a moment. When the astrology boom is over, something else that will tell people what they want to hear will replace it, but the millennia-old practice of real astrology will remain. The bust will come when Neptune gets out of Pisces, despite all the astrologers who promised that transit would bring us “a renewed spirituality”. (Pisces is also about insanity and fraud, but sure, OK, whatever.)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d5d7924582f547eef055835a6afbe9e120061ae/0_33_5784_3471/master/5784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f917e4c69d1381fcb7f2181bdaabd77","title":"banning huawei 5g china tech revolution free market","story":"China’s hi-tech firms are challenging the west’s belief in the free market’s ability to innovateThe US military is one of the most powerful forces of state-financed technological innovation in the world. It has produced such important innovations as the internet, GPS technologies and LCD screens. But outside the military’s immediate technological needs, the US political economy is largely a “free market” system in which venture capitalists and private banks are often the only source of funding for innovations. We are now seeing the unravelling of this laissez-faire attitude, as China has for the first time outpaced the US with its development of 5G technology.Public funding for private-sector innovations is sometimes forthcoming, but nowhere near the scale China used to develop Huawei’s 5G technology. Huge amounts of funding from the Chinese Development Bank (CDB) and Export-Import Bank – two of the three banks devoted to bankrolling state policies – allowed Huawei to outcompete established firms such as Nokia and Ericsson in price, and later in the quality of their products. As one employee of Alcatel-Lucent, the telecommunications subsidiary of Nokia, said at the start of this process in 2005: “We won’t die at the hands of Huawei if we die, it will be at the hands of China Development Bank.”The telecommunications giant’s credit from the CDB totalled $30bn between 2004 and 2009, allowing the company to expand markets and spend $4.5bn on research and development in 2012 alone. Overseas, the Export-Import Bank has offered roughly $2.9bn of loans to 49 Huawei projects in 22 African countries since 2004.Simultaneously, under China’s “go global” policy, Beijing offered subsidies and credits to companies entering overseas energy markets or buying foreign technologies. Huawei’s network of 38 joint innovation centres and 14 research and development centres is a testament to this. These centres are dotted all over the world, predominantly built in more technologically developed countries, with a view to collaborating with local businesses and thus tailoring their products to those markets more effectively. Only last year, Huawei opened a joint innovation centre in London.Alongside state investment from the CDB, from 2006 onwards China moved away from its policy of facilitating investments made by foreign companies, in the hope that it would lead to a trickle down of knowledge and technologies. The problem with leaving trickle down to occur from foreign direct investments was that private companies didn’t willingly share intellectual property to do so would be tantamount to sacrificing profits. Even though international companies invest a lot in manufacturing in China, most of it has been for processed components, which generates minimal profits.The Chinese government started forcing foreign companies to share a certain amount of designs, code and technological knowhow with a Chinese collaborating firm if they wished to continue operations in China’s market of 1.3 billion potential customers. The policy change created joint ventures between western tech leaders and their Chinese equivalent firms.The Barack Obama administration blocked numerous attempts by Chinese tech companies to buy western technology firms as they sought to acquire the intellectual property involved. In 2018, the Donald Trump administration took action against China’s policy of trading market access for intellectual property, deeming it an affront to free-market principles, and issued a wave of trade tariffs on China. This was not a huge policy shift, though.In the case of Huawei, Trump banned the 5G network from operating in the US and is discussing ways in which competitors such as Nokia and Ericsson could be funded the US is essentially taking a page directly out of China’s subsidy playbook and violating the free-market principles it claimed to hold dear. To complicate matters, just last week the Pentagon stepped into the fray, defending US tech companies’ right to sell to Huawei, lest they lose the money they themselves need to innovate.The proposed quick fix of banning Chinese technology in western countries may offer a degree of increased security, depending on the equipment and networks in question. More broadly though, such tools will do little to interrupt the ongoing economic and innovation achievements of China’s technology leaders. China’s hi-tech firms are reaching technological frontiers by violating many contemporary beliefs and principles around free-market innovation. The trading of market access for technological knowhow and the concerted financing of national champions have been vital elements of their success.As far as the west is concerned, the horse has likely already bolted on who will be selling the first 5G equipment globally. However, if the US hopes to produce viable competitors to companies such as Huawei in the future, it might more seriously consider the value of a national development bank and the importance of international collaborations.

South Africa’s Durban delivers 320 days of sunshine every year, as well as surfing, foodie adventures and sensational land and sea safariOnce seen as the quiet cousin of cosmopolitan Cape Town and fast-paced Johannesburg, the natural wonders and cultural charms of Durban and its surrounds put it firmly on South Africa’s must-see map. Fly direct from London Heathrow to Durban with British Airways, then get exploring.The best place for a first-look at “Durbs” – as the locals call it – is down on the Golden Mile, an iconic stretch (nearly three-miles long, not one, as its name would have you believe) of powdery beaches backed by a colourful pedestrian promenade, all of it smartened up for the 2010 World Cup.Shimmering off to the north is another legacy project of the tournament, the Moses Mabhida Stadium. An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world’s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.With miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa’s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade – try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf – will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.From May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde’s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn’t enough, you can often spot dolphins ing in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time’s environmental research.Oceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you’ll find a neat cross section of the city’s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha’s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.But when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don’t leave without braving the famous “bunny chow”: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You’ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (£4.19).It’s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It’s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.There’s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.A 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You’ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers’ market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa’s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views – of breaching whales and the ocean – but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there’s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.Another 30 minutes’ drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort’s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.South Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours’ drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.Or head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.So now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow? One thing’s for certain, Durban is no longer second fiddle when it comes to cosmopolitan coastal escapes in South Africa.How to bookWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Durban, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

It would do this by burning wood or plants and then capturing and storing the emissions. She said Drax’s carbon negative ambition could be achieved alongside “new, high efficiency gas power capacity as part of our portfolio” and provide electricity when the wind was not blowing or the sun shining.The UK government’s actions to tackle the climate emergency are under particular scrutiny this year as it will host a vital UN summit in Glasgow in November. The world’s nations must dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions at the summit to avoid a disastrous 3-4C rise in global temperatures.In its planning application, Drax said its proposal for four new gas turbines was warranted to replace its existing two coal-fired units ahead of the government’s proposed phase-out of coal in 2025. It said the new gas plant would be “capable” of having carbon capture technology fitted in the future.In overruling the planning inspectorate, Leadsom argued that the plant’s high carbon emissions were not a reason to block approval under the existing rules. “While the significant adverse impact of the proposed development on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted to atmosphere is acknowledged, the policy set out in the relevant National Policy Statements makes clear that this is not a matter that should displace the presumption in favour of granting consent.”ClientEarth says the government’s latest forecasts estimate the UK will need 6GW of new gas generation up to 2035. The UK has already approved more than 15GW of large-scale gas plants, it said, so approving Drax’s project would take this to three times the government’s estimates.The environmental lawyers argued the combination of the project’s large scale, level of carbon emissions and long operating life made it a significant threat to the UK’s carbon targets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f42f17efe241c188c5bd5e94a04b787eafa4084/20_132_1969_1181/master/1969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f76dec8988f80edd527a2a97f87c7c60","title":"the most disturbing talking animals in film ranked","story":"As Dolittle hits the multiplex of our hearts, we take a look at the creepiest vocalising varmints of cinema historyImagine Dolittle, but about a depressed zookeeper whose girlfriend had left him because he was a zookeeper, and the subsequent efforts of the animals at the zoo to teach the zookeeper how to get laid. That’s Zookeeper. Bernie, voiced by Nick Nolte, is a full-grown gorilla that the titular zookeeper breaks out of the zoo so that they can go to TGI Fridays, sing Flo Rida songs together and apparently get drunk together. Bernie ends the evening by slow dancing with a sexually aroused secretary while the zookeeper smashes up an acoustic guitar. If you have children and A Boy and His Dog appear on any streaming services, don’t watch it. At first glance, it looks like the sort of earnestly dumb Disney movie that Kurt Russell would have made in the 70s, but it is not that at all. A Boy and His Dog takes place in the aftermath of nuclear war, as a young man scavenges for food with a dog of contemptible character. Voiced by Tim McIntire, Blood’s one job is to find post-apocalyptic women for Don Johnson to have sex with in return for food. They eat a woman at the end. Like I said, not for kids.First there was a talking baby. Then there were two talking babies. And then, in the third Look Who’s Talking film, they introduced a dog. Voiced by Danny DeVito, Rocks was a dog so sexually confident that his opening line to a poodle is: “What do you say you and me go play Bury the Bone?” He accuses his best friend of being the product of incest. Why is he called Rocks, you ask? Because he’s incontinent. This is a kid’s film.The first film produced by MTV, Joe’s Apartment was about a slobby man whose home is invaded by an army of talking cockroaches. Billy West plays Ralph, the leader of the cockroaches, with other cockroaches voiced by Tim Blake Nelson and Dave Chapelle. If you like films where maniacally giggling cockroaches crawl through food, perform Busby Berkeley dance numbers on top of a filthy toilet and crawl under the skirts of terrified women, this is the film for you.By 1988, Bobcat Goldthwait was hot property. His presence helped to elevate three successive Police Academy movies and it seemed as if anything was possible. But then he made Hot to Trot, a film about a talking horse and everything fell apart. It was not just any talking horse but a talking horse that passes on stock tips to Goldthwait, becomes richer than its wildest dreams, moves into Goldthwait’s apartment, wrecks it after a riotous all-animal party, is visited by the spirit of his father in the form of a fly and then wins a race by talking all the other horses out of running. Weird that it didn’t do better.In a film called Cats \u0026amp Dogs, of course the dogs are going to be the protagonists. Cats could never be the hero of a story. Cats are awful. And therefore it makes complete sense that the primary antagonist of Cats \u0026amp Dogs would be Mr Tinkles, an evil, spoilt persian who Weekend at Bernies his infirm billionaire human owner in an effort to destroy the entire world. I’ve met cats. This behaviour tracks.Shortly before he switched careers and became a genuinely disturbing once-a-year festive YouTuber, Kevin Spacey made the worst film of his life. Barry Sonnenfeld’s Nine Lives is basically Liar Liar except – and this is a big except – instead of being forced to tell the truth, a negligent father is transformed into a cat named Mr Fuzzypants. Want to know how Mr Fuzzypants saves the day? He doesn’t. He falls from the top of a skyscraper and dies horribly after mistaking his adult human base-jumping son for a man attempting suicide. I mean, where to start? The part when Mike Myers’s cat is so aroused by a photo of a woman that his hat goes stiff? The part when he bends over and his fur rides up revealing a human bottom? The part when he repeatedly threatens to murder a second cat, also played by Myers, with a knife? The part when attempts to tongue-kiss a garden implement he had previously called a “dirty hoe”? The part when he spells the word “Shit”? The part where he goes to a nightclub to ogle Paris Hilton? This film was such a mess that the Seuss estate banned the entire film industry from making another live action adaptation.One of the 33 films (seriously) that Eric Roberts made in 2013, A Talking Cat!?! is probably the most notorious. It’s a film about a cat that can talk to people, but only once per person, and only in the distracted, poorly recorded, down-the-line drawl of Eric Roberts while its mouth forms a badly animated black slit. The AV Club said the film “is The Room of anthropomorphic animal movies featuring Eric Roberts” and, in the one known piece of promotion Roberts did for this film, he said of it: “Hey, it is what it is, pal.”You will have noticed by now that the top 5 of this Ranked! are all cats. That’s because I saw Cats at the cinema and I now hate cats. Picking a weirdest cat from the Cats lineup is almost impossible (the railway cat? The cat with boobs? Jason Derulo’s Towie cat? The suicidal cat?) and yet Rebel Wilson’s Jennyanydots makes the choice a little easier. Because Jennanydots is the masturbating cat who unzips her own skin and eats mice that for some reason have the voice of screaming children.

Comedy notoriously doesn’t do well at the Oscars but a whimsical satire about a fanatical Nazi-loving 10-year-old whose imaginary best friend is a stroppy Adolf Hitler? Well, it’s hard to imagine that going down comfortably with Academy voters who tend to be risk averse and much prefer to stick with worthy prestige dramas.But people love an underdog and Jojo Rabbit is far from an obvious choice for this category. Raising laughs from such a gruesome period of history is a tricky – and not to mention downright risky – tightrope to walk, but the New Zealand film-maker takes to it with acrobatic skill and poise applying his distinctive wit to a big-hearted and ultimately uplifting tale about family, acceptance and how ludicrous racism is.This isn’t the consensus across the board. Jojo Rabbit has become one of the most Marmite nominees this year (bar Joker), with critics cleanly ided between love and hate. Peter Bradshaw didn’t hold back, calling it “a pointless Hitler-spoofy YA adventure with a 12A certificate, obtusely accentuating little-kid cuteness and optimism amid the quaintly imagined non-horror” in a one-star review. Clearly, it’s not to everyone’s taste but, as Waititi said in an interview with the , appealing to “every single person” would just be plain “boring”.Still, you can put me firmly in the camp that was effortlessly charmed because it is a genuine delight. The surreal coming-of-age, an adaptation of Christine Leunens’s novel Caging Skies, is very much in the vein of Waititi’s body of work (Boy, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows) blending irreverent humour and goofy slapstick with an engaging story. Sure, it doesn’t have the technical brilliance of something like 1917, but Jojo Rabbit is the director’s most mature film to date and the way he navigates the different shifts in tone, ricocheting between absurdity and tragedy so nimbly that it never seems jarring, certainly deserves plaudits.Newcomer Roman Griffin Davis as the brainwashed Jojo makes a hilarious double act with Waititi, a buffoonish Hitler, who becomes increasingly moody and unhinged as he gets shut out by the boy’s growing awareness that his antisemitic beliefs might be wrong. Scarlett Johansson is so affecting as Jojo’s mother, the always dancing and effervescent Rosie, that she earned an Oscar nomination (her second this year) for best supporting actress. Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson provide great comedic support as inept Hitler Youth leaders.Yes, it is at times a bit too silly (the scene where the Gestapo show up and it turns into a mass of Heil Hitler-ing, for instance) but it always knows when to rein it in with some genuinely tender moments. At its heart, it’s a moving and empathetic story about unconditional maternal love about believing your son is a good person even though he wants to be a Nazi. It’s the opposite of ignorance. It’s about love trumping hate. Always.Chances are the Academy won’t reward something this audacious, even with it’s timely message, but that’s just a stunning lack of imagination on their part. There’s an unabashed sweetness and boldness here that is painfully absent in the other contenders, most of which are telling stories that we’ve seen plenty of times before. You can’t say that about Jojo Rabbit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19f3fd4e115c8ba334806714b474df2b81ac7e28/476_668_3633_2180/master/3633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe8378c8a48ec29d1db4a46178ac0e93","title":"the psychology of small plates why food service radically changes how much we eat","story":"Two hundred years ago a group of aristocrats changed the way we eat – for the worse. If you ever worry you’ll still be hungry after dessert, here’s whyI was confronted by a conundrum at the weekend. My sister had made chickpea curry for 14, and a lentil and mushroom curry, also for 14, and there were 22 of us, and if you’re wondering why there was no meat on this table, it’s because all the meat eaters of the older generation are dead. Take heed, carnivores. Oh, but also, there were sausages.Anyway, hours in, when I was on my fourth or fifth helping, I noticed that there was no end to it. No, there was more of it than when we started. There was a lake of chickpeas. We had got to the “Would you like to take some home?” stage. And here’s what was truly bizarre: the quantities weren’t actually for 14 she had taken a recipe for two, and tripled it. So, it was basically two dishes for six, and it could have fed three generations of extended Williamses for a week. How is this possible? How do you explain this exponential thing that happens, when you scale up a recipe a few times and somehow end up with enough to feed 1,000 people?There is food psychology at play: if you experience plenty on a table, you don’t panic that it’s a scarce resource, and you tailor your portion. I once read a detailed analysis of the feeding of the 5,000, which posited that everybody had brought a small amount of food with them, but was excruciated by the potential embarrassment of having to share it with more people than it would feed. Once there were two spare fish kicking around, they felt liberated to crack out the nuts they had in their pocket. It’s possible that I should stop checking out literal-explanations-of-the-Bible websites. But you get the picture: abundance begets generosity, etc.So the question is, why don’t we always eat like this? The Russian service has a lot to answer for.This is the meal convention we have settled on: a series of dishes served one after the other, raising the prospect that you will never quite get enough, unless you are presented from the start with way too much. It began to displace the French service – a table groaning with everything at once – in the early 19th century, but didn’t catch on in Britain for another 60-odd years, although that’s nothing on how long it took us to wake up to garlic.Its benefits were twofold: the food was hotter as you ate it, and it required a lot of servants, so it made you look rich, provided, of course, that you were rich. In its original form, it could range from six courses to 30. You can see the trace of it in the modern tasting menu, favoured by people who look at the lithographs in Charles Ranhofer’s The Epicurean and think: “I wish I could look as bored as that.” (That is monumentally unfair: most of the illustrations are of coffee pots.)Anyway, its bare bones were oysters, soup, fish, entree, roast, pudding. With their abundance and unimaginable poshness, the Russian aristocrats thus completely wiped the table with the French, whose only fightback was cheese. There was a simplified version for people who lacked the staff, known as the English service – soup, starter, roast, served by the actual hosts, which was only one rung above being fed in a stable – and you could argue the toss for ever about whether that caught on, since we have ended up with not 30 courses or even six, but three: a starter, a main course and a pudding. Yet at the same time, the overall fandango is very much rooted in service à la Russe. There’s something about descriptions of pre-revolutionary Russian cooking that is weirdly magical, Harry Potterish: boar, followed by walnuts in honey, followed by pancakes, followed by more boar. I can totally see how this went 19th-century viral.And yet the Russian service, in its modern, restaurant incarnation, is rigid and repetitive – always with the meat and two veg, always not enough of the best thing and too much of the worst, wasteful and inidualistic. Everybody with any sense prefers what I choose to call the Spanish service, based on the discovery of tapas late last century – the freedom of having dishes small enough that you could order more if you wanted, the fellowship of being able to all eat from the whatever plate. You could just as well call it the Chinese service, based on dim sum. But this emphatically is not a return to the groaning tables of 18th-century France, since the dishes are deliberately small, which trend in turn created the Shoreditch service – a number of sharing plates that all cost as much as regular plates but aren’t as big.I suspect the 2020s will see a return to the original ways – huge platters, all on the table at once, creating such an aura of largesse that you feel full just looking at them. Nobody will ever finish, but because the dishes are now made of chickpeas, it won’t matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/305aba7c8564bcf4a4910881e956b7eeda9c13be/0_256_6457_3874/master/6457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe35b8d27623dc9b1712042d1fe25542","title":"swansea conor gallagher chelsea on loan frank lampard","story":"End-of-season awards can be deemed trivial but, at Chelsea, the academy player of the year accolade carries considerable weight. Just ask Conor Gallagher, the latest recipient of that prize. “The previous three winners all play for the first team now, so there’s a bit of pressure,” the 19-year-old says, his smile broadening, referring to Reece James, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori, fixtures of Frank Lampard’s squad after spending last season on loan in the Championship. “I was buzzing when I heard I had won, knowing the players that have won it and what they have gone on to do.”For Gallagher, who joined Swansea on loan a fortnight ago having shone at Charlton in the first half of the season, that award was a welcome addition to an already handsome silverware collection. Three years ago Gallagher won the Under-17 World Cup with England under the now Swansea head coach, Steve Cooper and, last season, the teenager picked up a Europa League winner’s medal, having been an unused substitute as Chelsea beat Arsenal in Baku. “They are in a drawer at home,” he says. “They’re safe, don’t worry about that. I’ve got all the ones from Chelsea Under-18s as well. My World Cup shirt is framed, which is always nice to see because it always brings back good memories. It’s where everyone can see it when they walk in the house.”Gallagher scored five goals in his first two and a half months at Charlton, form that earned an England Under-21 call-up in October, and the midfielder, whose work ethic particularly impressed his manager there, Lee Bowyer, is determined to continue his upward trajectory. Inspiration is hardly in short supply, with academy alumni Callum Hudson-Odoi and Tammy Abraham making a splash for club and country, while Billy Gilmour, Tariq Lamptey, whom Gallagher has played with since joining Chelsea aged seven, and James, whom he played with as a kid for Epsom Eagles, have been handed first-team debuts this season.“I had a message from Frank Lampard earlier on in the season, saying: ‘Well done, your work is not going unnoticed,’ which is always nice to hear,” Gallagher says. “I always looked up to him growing up scoring goals, making assists, working hard and just being busy on the pitch – that is how I want to be. Now he is the manager it’s very exciting.“There are a lot of boys in the Chelsea squad now who have proved themselves and that is why they are playing now, like Reece, Mason, Fikayo and Tammy. They all played in the Championship and did really well and I feel like if I can do that, I think I can have a chance with Chelsea next season. I think the pathway is a lot easier now with Frank Lampard and the other coaching staff they want to bring youngsters through the academy. You can see that this season so it is very promising for players like me and other Chelsea youngsters. I think it gives you more hope and drive to do well, because obviously there is more chance of getting to the first team.”A January switch to Swansea meant Gallagher living away from the family home in Bookham, close to Chelsea’s Cobham training base, for the first time but there is no shortage of familiar faces in south Wales, with Marc Guehi and Rhian Brewster, both of whom also lifted the World Cup under Cooper, joining on loan this month. Gallagher played with Guehi and Brewster for Chelsea from the age of seven until the latter joined Liverpool at 14 and their relationship led to Brewster describing the trio as The Three Musketeers. “You could say that,” Gallagher says, breaking into laughter during his first major national newspaper interview at Swansea’s Fairwood training base before Saturday’s match at fellow play-off chasers Preston. “For us to be here together is really exciting because we are all good mates as well. That has helped us settle and hopefully that shows on the pitch as well.”Chelsea’s loan coaches Carlo Cudicini and Tore André Flo track Gallagher’s development, togetehr with the technical mentor and former Swansea assistant manager, Claude Makelele, but the teenager also values the advice of those closer to home: his three elder brothers, two of whom, Jake and Daniel, play for Dorking Wanderers after being released by Millwall and AFC Wimbledon respectively. Jake’s twin, Josh, plays for Chipstead FC.“They have helped me throughout my career they have always told me to work my hardest and ‘don’t get too big for your boots’, pretty much, which is important. They have been on some journeys and they found it hard they understand that you just have to be confident and they know I’ve got the ability so they don’t want me to waste it. You have to work hard every day. You have to play every game like it’s your last, because I feel that everyone who is on the pitch is lucky to be there. I try and leave everything on the pitch.”That tenacity, Gallagher says, is intertwined to the summer of 2018, when he spent two months sidelined after minor heart surgery. Gallagher felt his heart beating eerily fast on his return to pre-season training with Chelsea and fell ill, a few days after experiencing a similar sensation while at the Under-19s European Championship. “It was quite a tough one-v-one session and it was too much for me. I felt a bit dizzy and had to pull out of training and that’s when I got the checks, scans, and when they saw something was wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59a672154bef985db17f79e8e13ec2a191bca0db/0_74_5037_3022/master/5037.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c432a59954db19ae413bbc29a104ea21","title":"transfer news bruno fernandes olivier giroud and danny rose live","story":"Potter has nothing to say on Gaetan Bong, who is with Forest. He’s not trained today but nothing is confirmed. Potter won’t speak about Mac Allister and reiterates the importance of Glenn Murray, who’d like to play more. He seems to be staying at the not Goldstone Ground. As was Celtic-Racing the previous season.Talking of Estudiantes, here’s their World Club Cup tussle with Manchester United in 1968. It was rough.Brighton are hoping to get the tremendously-named Alexis Mac Allister back from Boca Juniors. Previously, he hadn’t been awarded a work permit, but that is now in place. Marcos Rojo, who was in the away end at the Etihad last night wearing an alluring orange puffa, is close to sealing his return to Estudiantes, on loan. Buzzing to find out for which game he’s getting rushed back. As per the below, Chelsea are reportedly up for Dries Mertens. But so are ... yes ... Inter. He’d be a nofty acquisition for either. Apparently Everton have kaybeed Barcelona’s £80m bid for Richarlison. I wonder about him: he looks to have all the attributes to be a serious players. I wonder what he makes of it all. Chris Wilder, wearing a coat and snood in doors – maybe he’s not staying long, but can’t expect to feel the benefit when he leaves – expects to bring in maybe three players. A deal is close for Sander Berge who is, apparently, in Sheffield. This thread is excellent for those who’d like more information on Fernandes, and to have that information presented in words not numbers.Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said last night that Fernandes is “fit and ready to play”. He also said he needs someone read to “break their nose” to score – a repudiation, no doubt, of Anthony Martial who plays like he wouldn’t even break win. Afternoon all and thanks Tom. A man is stood outside Old Trafford – “a veteran of many deadline days”, sweardown someone just said that – explaining that Bruno Fernandes is having a medical. And with that, I’ll hand you over to Daniel Harris, who’ll sort the afternoon’s wheat from the chaff for you. Email him here if you fancy. Bye.Into Ligue 1, and a sizeable deal reported from Lyon, who have signed the defensive midfielder Bruno Guimarães for €20m. AP reports that the 22-year-old Guimares has joined from the Brazilian club Athletico Paranaense until June 2024.A couple of nuggets of Football League news: Cardiff have signed the Bournemouth defender Brad Smith on loan for the rest of the season. The Australian international has been on loan at the MLS club Seattle since March. And Scunthorpe have sacked their manager, Paul Hurst, as the Iron flounder in the bottom half of League Two. What’s happened with Hurst? His Shrewsbury side of a couple of years ago were really highly regarded, but since his ill-fated Ipswich move nothing’s really worked for him.More Barcelona talk: the Spanish champions are reportedly preparing a £20m offer for Chelsea’s Willian, according to Sky Sports’ Kaveh Solhekol. Meanwhile his near-namesake Willian José is set to be the target of a revived bid from Spurs for his services. But we’re living off speculative scraps at the moment without the meat and potatoes of proper Done Deals.More from Sheffield United: Sander Berge’s fee has been agreed, release clauseadd-ons being negotiated, and his agent is at the Blades’ training ground, the ’s own Jamie Jackson tells us. It will be a club record if the deal for Genk’s Norway midfielder gets over the line. “Hi Tom.” Hi Justin Frost. “Restos, Berge and, according to the Beeb, Dutch striker Richairo Zivkovic. Is Chris Wilder a secret FM fanatic? All three wonderkids were the backbone of my mighty Torquay United team who went on to dominate the Premier league and Europe. I predict a future Blades dominance. Also rumours of Richarlison going to Barca. Really? Brief glimpses of quality but generally mediocre. The mind boggles …”Sometimes I think these huge-price thwarted deals are just thrown out there to give us something to talk about while nothing much happens. Anyway, I’d like to know more about Torquay’s era of European dominance. Not before time, frankly. Manchester United latest: Bruno Fernandes is at the club’s training ground, and according to Sky “literally crawling to the finish line” in completing his medical (no pictures of this literal crawling yet available). Confirmation of the deal is expected in late-afternoon. Fernandes may even make his debut against Wolves on Saturday. United might yet be in for a striker in the next 35 hours too.There’s reports afoot that Manchester City have gazumped Barcelona in the pursuit of the teenage right-back Yan Couto and secured a €15m deal with the Brazilian club Coritiba for the 17-year-old’s service.Yahoo Sports reports that Manchester City have swooped in late to thwart a €10m move to Barcelona and bring Couta to the Premier League. Couto’s Coritiba contract was set to expire at the end of the season. The report says that Couto will travel to England to finalise the details and confirm the deal, but will have to return to Coritiba for a few months before turning 18 in June, when he will officially move to Manchester.Meanwhile, sometime Chelsea and Spurs target Krzysztof Piatek has arrived in Berlin for a medical ahead of his move from Milan to Hertha.The Bristol City captain Josh Brownhill will undergo a medical at Burnley this afternoon ahead of a move that could be worth up to £10m. Going in the opposite direction, in a separate deal, is the striker Nahki Wells, who spent the first half of this season on loan at Queens Park Rangers.Brownhill has matured into one of the best box-to-box midfielders in the Championship since joining the club from Preston in 2016. Earlier this season City manager Lee Johnson said: “He is a very good student and has been since I first took him on loan to Barnsley. I could see that there was a superstar in the making. He probably goes down as one of the value signings in Bristol City’s history.”Nathan Ferguson, also included in the ’s guide to the most promising players in the Championship this season, is set to join Crystal Palace before window shuts.Over in Serie A, Roma have signed the Barcelona forward Carles Pérez in a deal worth an initial €11m, ESPN is reporting. Perez, who has made 10 appearances in La Liga this season, has signed a contract with Roma until 2024.More Sheffield United news: As well as signing Sander Berge, Chris Wilder is hoping to nail down a deal for the Bayer Leverkusen and Greece defender Panagiotis Retsos. More when and if we get it.Here’s more on Podence’s move to Wolves, from PA MediaWolves have completed the signing of Portuguese winger Daniel Podence from Olympiacos on a four-and-a-half-year deal. The fee is understood to be £17m, which makes the 24-year-old the third most expensive signing in the club’s history behind Raul Jimenez (£32m) and Adama Traore (£18m).Podence becomes the 10th Portuguese player within manager Nuno Espirito Santo’s current squad, and is part of the same Sporting Lisbon academy that produced goalkeeper Rui Patricio and midfielder João Moutinho.Podence made 40 appearances for Sporting before joining Greek Super League side Olympiacos in August 2018, scoring 11 goals in 64 appearances. Internationally, Podence has been capped at five different youth levels, playing alongside current Wolves players Ruben Neves and Diogo Jota for Portugal Under-21s. Wolves are now awaiting international clearance for their latest capture, which makes him a doubt to be available for Saturday’s Premier League clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford.Speaking about his move, Podence told the club website: “I’m very excited. It was always a childhood dream of mine to play in the Premier League and I look at this achievement as a dream come true. “Wolves are a team with a big project, with ambitious goals to look forward to, where I’ll get to meet former team-mates with whom I had the pleasure to play with in the past and I hope to be very successful here.”Unsurprisingly, one of the main reasons he has joined Wolves is due to the considerable Portuguese contingent at the club. He added: “Of course, I spoke with Rui, but I also know Ruben, Jota and Moutinho very well. “I think that’s going to be a big help for me to adapt to English football, which is challenging. It’s really good to have well-known faces around.”So, this Chelsea link to a Dries Mertens bid then? Reports from Italy suggest Chelsea have bid €5.5m (£4.6m) for the 32-year-old, whose contract with Napoli expires in the summer. Frank Lampard hasn’t had it all his own way on Chelsea’s return to window-world after their ban, and Mertens might be tempted, given the indifferent season Napoli are having domestically. We shall see.In Manchester United deals actually going ahead, Bruno Fernandes is in Manchester now having his medical. But not before issuing a tearful video to Sporting Lisbon fans about how much he loved their club. “There were important moments that made a mark on my career. I went through many positive things and many negative things,” he told Sporting TV.Breaking news: Wolves have managed to land the winger Daniel Podence from Olympiacos on a four and a half year deal for a fee thought to be around £17m, and here’s the now-obligatory portentous video montage to mark it.Chelsea loaning out promising starlets is a January staple. And you can read about one such, Conor Gallagher, here. Ben Fisher met him for a chat, a couple of weeks into his loan spell at Swansea, about recovering from heart surgery, Frank Lampard and what he hopes to achieve at the Liberty and beyond.What to make of a couple of today’s more eye-opening tidbits, Everton rebuffing a whopping £85m bid from Barcelona for Richarlison, and the speculation that Manchester United want another garlanded 30-something, Barça’s Ivan Rakitic? In stuff definitely happening, Sander Berge has arrived in south Yorkshire to finalise his move to Sheffield United from Genk. First off, a couple of Championship deals to tell you about. Bristol City have secured a deal for second-tier perennial Nahki Wells from Burnley. Wells spent the first half of the season on loan at QPR, and now the forward is set to bolster the Robins’ attacking options. He’s due a medical at Ashton Gate later today. Elsewhere, Luton have signed Tottenham’s Cameron Carter-Vickers on loan to reinforce a defence that needs reinforcing the Championship’s bottom club have shipped 63 goals this term.Anyway, on to business. Here’s a recap of some of the latest stories:Tottenham’s Danny Rose is heading north-east on a Newcastle loan deal:Chelsea are looking to make a late swoop for Napoli’s Dries Mertens:Manchester United’s protracted pursuit of Bruno Fernandes is finally set to be completed:And Arsenal are getting some defenders in:"},{"url":null,"title":"journey to the savage planet game review","story":"PC, PS4 (version tested), Xbox One Typhoon Studios505 GamesThere are moments of fun to be had while exploring a cunningly designed alien world, but it borrows liberally from other gamesFloating sky islands are to video game design what the word “baby” is to pop music, a cliche so deeply entrenched that its presence is taken for granted despite being inherently weird. They are the industry standard for any game developer seeking to represent a surreal environment. They are the foundation of dream and hallucination sequences (see Marvel’s Spider-Man, Dishonored, Call of Duty: Black Ops), and fundamental to alien planets. Unfortunately, their very ubiquity has now rendered them mundane.Journey to the Savage Planet is set entirely on floating islands, which is fitting for a game that seems to be perpetually seeking an identity. Typhoon Studios’ debut title is a drifting archipelago of ideas that, while pleasant enough to hop around, never quite comes together to form a distinctive experience.Savage Planet puts you in the spacesuit of an explorer who has crash-landed on a fractured world that isn’t really a planet, on which the most savage creature is you. Employed by a typically oppressive sci-fi corporation named Kindred Technologies, you (and a partner if you’re playing cooperatively) are tasked with charting this alien world for potential human colonisation. Exploration is directed without being strictly linear. You collect resources from the landscape and use them to craft equipment ranging from jetpacks to grappling hooks. These open up new pathways, which in turn lead to additional resources and further upgrades.Typhoon Studios borrows liberally from other games to construct Savage Planet’s toolset. It adopts the scanning system of No Man’s Sky, with which you catalogue the planet’s erse and occasionally aggressive wildlife. For its combat, Savage Planet graduated from the one-two punch school of Bioshock, combining a fast-firing pistol with various throwable objects such as acid grenades and exploding “bombegranates”.All of this works fine, and the colourful environments are enjoyable to explore despite the tired floating island concept. Hidden within the planet’s shattered strata are giant mushroom forests and crystalline caves, while its centre is dominated by a mysterious alien megastructure. One of Savage Planet’s more notable achievements is communicating a sense of scale and freedom in a game that is only a fraction of the size of most open-world contemporaries. It tickles the part of your brain that yearns for distant horizons without demanding a huge chunk of your life, unlike Skyrim or Breath of the Wild.The problem is there’s little to Savage Planet that’s new or hasn’t been done better elsewhere. In the absence of a specific mechanical hook, Savage Planet turns to comedy to grab the player’s attention, aiming for the satirical bite and splatter ratio of a Paul Verhoeven movie. Every alien animal you slaughter explodes into a quivering mass of vivid goo. When you return to your ship to upgrade equipment, obnoxious adverts for products like memory-erasing “brain wipes” yammer at you from a wall-mounted TV.Like the general structure, the comedy is intermittently successful, veering between amusing and irritating. The satire is toothless, doing little to differentiate itself from Fallout, The Outer Worlds and every other parody of capitalism that gaming seemingly loves despite being one of the most corporate industries around. The mock adverts will make you laugh, as will the capering of Kindred’s hyperactive CEO, but the objects of the game’s ridicule are too vague and distant for it to be more than window dressing.Strangely, for all the noise Savage Planet makes, its strongest moments are its quietest. There’s an element of silent theatre to the way your character communicates his goofy personality through his hands, while the world design is spotted with pleasing flourishes, such as trees bearing foliage that transforms into butterflies. In the end, it’s little touches like this, rather than the more in-your-face moments, that lend Savage Planet the dash of flavour it spends so much energy searching for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/528b62a0f626c1484d383416c8305661f9cdea05/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d93e1e4d361d2bc4de65b552ea7b5aab","title":"drought leaves tens of thousands in lesotho one step from famine","story":"Rural areas worst hit as massive fall in food production causes severe hunger for a quarter of country’s population Tšepo Molapo gazes into space, worrying about where the next meal will come from. Next to him, his two-year-old granddaughter plays, oblivious of their desperate situation.Molapo’s children all died at illegal mines in neighbouring South Africa, where they had trekked in search of work.Molapo, 80, relies on a monthly government pension payout of about $48 (£37) but the paltry amount cannot feed him and the eight grandchildren he cares for on his own following the death of his wife.“I do not know how I am going to survive with my grandchildren,” Molapo says.At least 71,000 people in rural areas are “one step away from famine”, says Jens Laerke, spokesperson from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which in December launched a $34m flash appeal for more funding.“We can’t plant any crops in this drought situation. The rains only came last December and everything we had planted had wilted. We have no livestock left to sell or exchange for grain. So, unless we get help, we are just going to starve,” says Molapo.Last October, the government declared a national disaster over the food crisis, appealing to its development partners for help.But the attention of minister appears to have been erted by internal conflict and unrest in the country.The prime minister, Thomas Thabane, has been at the centre of of a power struggle with his party deputy, Nqosa Mahao. Thabane, who leads the All Basotho Convention, the major player in a four-party governing coalition, has been called for police questioning over alleged links to the murder of his estranged wife, and has said he will step down.The government has also faced strikes and threats of strikes by teachers, nurses and factory workers, who are demanding wage increases and improved working conditions.Unprecedented strike action by magistrates, doctors and police officers has also taken place in recent months. The magistrates and doctors have sued the government for pay rises and better conditions.The government’s efforts to secure budget support from the International Monetary Fund have so far hit a brick wall, with the organisation imposing conditions that include reducing the high public wage bill, public financial management reforms and the implementation of the much-delayed multi-sector reforms, aimed at bringing greater stability to Lesotho, that were recommended by the Southern African Development Community.The EU ambassador to Lesotho, Christian Manahl, told the  that February’s budget speech will indicate what the government intends to do to address the food crisis.“We are waiting for the new budget to be presented, this will give us an idea about the government’s own efforts to address the challenges created by the drought of last year,” Manahl said.The World Food Programme (WFP) is expecting to reach 174,000 people with monthly mobile cash payments to eligible families over the next six months. Those unable to access mobile money will receive food parcels.Napo Ntlou, the WFP’s emergency coordinator for Lesotho, said that even when there is no drought, the agency provides assistance to at least 200,000 people annually in the country’s southern districts.“We have engaged the government to have some projects related to building the resilience of people in the southern districts. In our five-year country strategic plan, we have a resilience component which is going to be undertaken in the southern parts of the country to ensure that at least when there are shocks, the people can recover very quickly,” Ntlou said.For Mathabo Tlalajoe, from Mohale’s Hoek, it will take more than $52 a month to feed her family of seven.“The intervention is welcome but it’s still not enough. We hope that the next vulnerability assessment will give us more,” Tlalajoe said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5166bf220b4bfe926b0c32ba1a5eb175be302c/927_95_5974_3585/master/5974.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e736801395b8a2298a0de13fae2aa95e","title":"tattoos and the armed forces in pictures","story":"Tribute Ink is a new exhibition featuring photographs by Charlie Clift at the National Army Museum, that explores how the military community uses tattoos.

The Madame X tour arrives in Britain trailing a different kind of controversy to the one you might expect from Madonna. There have been cancelled shows, talks of health issues, hotly contested reports of slow ticket sales, and stories of audiences booing and even attempting to sue her for turning up on stage hours late. And there are the grumbles about a setlist that’s bullishly heavy on tracks from her most recent album and takes what you would politely describe as an intriguing approach to her back catalogue. She sings the bare minimum of big hits – Vogue, Like a Prayer, Human Nature – with Express Yourself and La Isla Bonita reduced to interstitial roles (the former performed as a sweet, but brief a cappella duet with her daughter Mercy), and American Life performed in full.Still, it occasionally serves to remind you that some of Madame X is better than its relatively muted commercial response might suggest – Medellín sounds like the hit single it wasn’t, as does the gorgeous album track Crazy. This is presumably part of the point – the other part being a certain screw-you intransigence designed to underline that we are in the presence of an artiste, not a pop star.Madonna plays up her proximity to the audience: usually seated in a different postal district to the stage, today they are within touching distance. She talks about the venue’s wonderful intimacy – a speech she delivers, oddly, while hidden behind a black wooden screen with only her feet visible, which feels a little like talking about a breathtaking view when you’ve got a paper bag over your head. She gamely interacts with the audience, up to and including stealing first a punter’s seat, then his beer, occasionally scuppered by the fact that the people she interacts with are too overawed by her regal presence to make any kind of sense.Otherwise, the performance doesn’t really do low key: it feels like an arena show crammed into a smaller space, with suitably eye-popping results. There are a series of tableaux that suggest Madonna is an ungovernable force of insurrection oppressed by shadowy forces – soldiers, trench-coated private eyes and indeed actual shadows. There is an appearance by Cape Verde’s Orquestra Batukadeiras, whose performance is so gleeful you scarcely notice Madonna herself, respectfully seated at the side of the stage. There is a fake riot, a moment where Madonna unexpectedly starts playing the bongos, a moment where Madonna is bundled across the stage shouting “fuck the patriarchy!” and a flatly brilliant staging of Frozen, accompanied by a sensuously choreographed video that initially appears to feature Madonna, but turns out to be her daughter Lourdes.There are also points where the show feels slightly scrappy and disjointed, and points where it sags – you really do get an awful lot of Portuguese fado for your buck – but it’s hard to feel short-changed. There’s such a lot going on over the course of two hours and it’s hard to imagine another star of her stature even thinking about trying anything as clearly experimental as this. The gammy hip that’s dominated headlines in recent weeks doesn’t seem to have much impact on her dancing, and she’s genuinely funny about both the price of tickets for the show and the bizarre moment in the early 00s when, living in Britain, she suddenly developed an English accent: “Why did you let me do that? I’m from Michigan.” Whether it’s really giving you a more intimate glimpse of Madonna is a moot point – physically closer to her fans or not, it’s still a show, not an evening of unvarnished soul-baring. But the racket they make when she finally leaves the stage suggests that, quite understandably, none of them care."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/929f272252e1c14bf7fef70673fdc841e9b33082/0_0_3678_2207/master/3678.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc9db4caf738980fee6105c51390886a","title":"armando iannucci on politics and satire podcast","story":"The creator of The Thick of It and Veep discusses why modern politics has moved beyond satire.

Will I pay home or EU student fees? Your questions answeredThere is continuing confusion about citizens’ rights after Brexit. We asked you about your concerns, and many wrote in with questions about pension and healthcare rights.You raised other issues too: can I still sail around Europe? Will I pay home fees if I start university in the Netherlands this year? What will happen about my pet’s passport? There is much unfinished Brexit business, as you will see from our answers below, composed with the help of experts and government departments.My children are fortunate enough to have UK and EU passports as their mother is an EU citizen. When booking flights and travelling to visit family in the EU, which passport should we use? I’m concerned if they travel to the UK on their EU passport, they’ll be penalised as not having settled status, and be penalised flying into the EU on a UK passport.Social care worker, Warwickshire.You can use either passport as immigration rules remain exactly the same for the next 11 months. There is no requirement for any EU citizen to present evidence of settled status to anyone as free movement applies until 31 December under the legally binding withdrawal agreement. What happens after that remains to be determined.I am a medical doctor from Madrid, Spain, doing a short clinical fellowship in oncology at the Royal Marsden hospital. I am in London for three months but have to make a trip to Madrid before I complete my last month. Will I have any problems? Do I need my passport or any additional documentation?Spanish citizen, London.No extra documentation is needed but passports and ID cards will be required as usual on entering the country. The UK remains in the single market until 31 December and EU rules on free movement will continue to apply until next year. So EU citizens are free to study, work or retire in the UK for the next 11 months.As a dual national, will I get into enormous trouble if I return to the UK on my Polish passport after 31 January without having my British one? It’s obviously a fairly avoidable situation but I’d kind of like to know how much trouble it could cause, or whether I would in fact be fine travelling on my EU passport still.Andrzej Lukowski, journalistNo. Your Polish passport will suffice until 31 December as freedom of movement still applies (see previous answers). If anyone asks you for any extra evidence, you’ll have yourself a news story.My trans-Atlantic lifestyle means travel via Dublin or Heathrow, and Belfast. Fair enough, I have to cope, as a UK citizen. But my pet dog follows separately, on a EU-wide pet passport. My fear is that her travel (flights usually Washington-Frankfurt-Dublin, thence by car to Northern Ireland) or vice versa will be utterly imperilled. I cannot find advice from our pet couriers. This may not be important to you, but my heart could soon be broken by post-Brexit regulations.Nick Brannon, retired archaeologistNothing will change for your pet before the end of the transition period on 31 December, but what happens afterwards depends on what is negotiated in the next 11 months. At present, dogs, cats and ferrets can travel freely across the EU on an EU pet passport, under the EU pet travel scheme.From next year, what they will need in the way of extra certificates and vaccinations will depend on whether the EU declares the UK a “part 1 listed third country” for pet travel purposes, a “part 2 listed third country” or an “unlisted third country”.Vets are hopeful the UK will gain part 1 status, which would require your pet to be microchipped and vaccinated against rabies 21 days before travel, and to hold a UK pet passport. A dozen non-EU European countries have this status.Many more, including the US, are part 2 listed, meaning pets need extra treatments (against tapeworm, for example) plus a vet’s certificate every time they travel. They must also enter the EU at a designated entry point.The conditions for pets from unlisted countries are even stricter. A worst-case scenario could result in owners having to pay considerable sums for extra vaccinations, treatments and certification every time their pets travel, and having to start the process up to four months beforehand.

While I see warnings about customs changes for companies that import or export goods, not even the staff at the government’s business Brexit helpline know what implications there are for businesses providing services to European clients. Our European clients ask me what will happen to the services we provide after Brexit and I have to tell them I have no idea. David, south-east EnglandI am a UK citizen living in England and currently receive a German state pension. I worked in West Germany in the 1970s. Will Brexit change this pension and the way I receive it?C, DorsetYour pension from Germany will continue to be paid as it is now under the withdrawal agreement. The threat of it changing was linked to a no-deal Brexit but it is protected for life under the withdrawal agreement. I am 73, retired and Danish and live in Edinburgh. I receive a smattering of state pensions from Denmark, the UK and Luxembourg as well as a small pension from the EU commission. I worry that the transfer of the various pensions will be more expensive. Do you think I am right to worry?L, EdinburghYour right to receive your aggregated pension is guaranteed under the withdrawal agreement and there is no reason that would change.I applied for university in the Netherlands, to start in September. I still don’t know whether I’ll be paying EU fees or not, and they don’t either. It would be good to know soon because I can’t afford to go if I have to pay non-EU fees.17-year-old student, London (name supplied)Those who start a course before the end of the transition period will still benefit from the reciprocal home fees arrangements among EU states. A spokesman for the Dutch government confirmed UK students starting courses this September would pay home fees – currently €2,043 (£1,722) a year – for the course’s duration, provided they remain living and registered in the Netherlands.I’m concerned that while I am currently a European citizen, with the right to work and live anywhere in the union, with access to justice and healthcare anywhere in the union, I’m now going to lose that. Michael Wooley, retired teacher, ChichesterFrom 1 February, British citizens who do not have dual nationality with another EU state are no longer European citizens. However, for the next 11 months, British citizens retain the free movement rights to study, work and retire in the EU.My French girlfriend works as a lecturer in France, teaching a few days a week, and regularly commutes between there and the UK. Post-Brexit, how will this work? She’s doesn’t work here or reside permanently for settled status.J, ManchesterAs she is an EU citizen she can study, work and retire in France, without any questions or extra paperwork, for life. The issue will be coming back into the UK after next year. If she is just visiting she may be fine on tourist access conditions for that have not yet been defined. But if she intends to remain living here, she will be required to demonstrate that she was resident here before Brexit fully happened on 31 December. The government has opened what is called the EU settlement scheme (EUSS), a special immigration category for EU citizens. There is a phone app and the process should be very straightforward. More than 2 million people have already successfully applied for settled status. EU citizens have up to 30 June next year to apply for EUSS but the Home Office is encouraging people to apply before the end of this year to reduce the risk of any difficulties with border control next year.As a retired British citizen living in the EU, I’m very worried about both my healthcare provision and UK state pension after Brexit. I’ve heard so many different versions. What is the situation exactly – should I be concerned?Susan Templeton, FranceThere is a lot of confusion about this: people still have in mind the rules that would have applied in the case of a no-deal exit. The rules for both healthcare and pensions are clearly set out in the withdrawal agreement, a legally binding international treaty.If you have an S1 reciprocal healthcare form (mainly applies to UK pensioners settled in the EU before 31 December), the UK will continue to meet the healthcare costs of you and your family as long as you remain legally resident in your host country, without time limit.An S1 form will also entitle you to a UK EHIC card for treatment when travelling within the EU, and UK law in any case entitles you to free treatment in Britain. Of course, if you are working in your host country and paying into its social security system, you will continue to be covered for healthcare there as before.The withdrawal agreement also states that UK state pensions, and all other UK benefits that may be paid to non-residents, will continue to be uprated annually, as if you were still living in the UK. This arrangement is also without time limit, contrary to the no-deal plans which no longer apply. Full details are here.I was born in Cork, Ireland, and have an Irish passport. I’ve lived in England for the past 61 years, since I was six months old. What are the arrangements for Irish passport holders and am I able to remain indefinitely in the UK?M, West Yorkshire.Irish passport holders are treated separately to the rest of EU citizens under the withdrawal agreement. This is partly because of the common travel area but also because of efforts by the British and Irish governments to ensure reciprocity of rights continues. So you have the right to remain indefinitely in the UK, and to work, study, vote, retire and travel between the UK and Ireland freely.I own a house in Spain. I bought the house with the intention of retiring there in a few years. What provisions will be made for the many thousands of people in my position?G, north-east EnglandIf you retire to an EU country before the end of the year, you will retain all the rights you currently have, apart from freedom of movement. If you are eligible for a pension or UK-funded healthcare (known as S1), you will retain these rights for life. What you will lose, as it currently stands, are the rights to study, work or retire in another member state. Britons in Europe are campaigning for this right to be granted in the next stage of negotiations, along with the right to return back to the UK with a EU family member, and the right for your children to pay home fees at a British university.This article might be of some interest as it features someone of a similar age (50s) who has just moved to Spain.The French and British government websites give little practical – and some contradictory – guidance about applying for a residence permit. The British government site refers to the French for definitive information. But in many places on their official site, the French authorities state that you will only need to apply for a permit if there is no withdrawal deal. Clearly, there is an agreement, but one only covering the transition period. So, we are in limbo until at least December 2020. How do we plan for retirement, move house, and continue to work when in such intolerable uncertainty?Robin Williams, Savoie, FranceAs a Briton legally resident in France, you are right that nothing will change during the transition period. After that, you will need to apply for a residency permit before June 2021, assuming the transition is not extended or France opts, as it may do under the withdrawal agreement, to extend its administrative deadline itself.It isn’t yet clear how you should apply, so it is probably best to wait until that becomes clear, presumably within the next few months.Until very recently France was focused on the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, and its online application process for post-Brexit residency applications has not yet been updated. We do not know if it will be, or if the government will revert to the old system via local authorities.The permit itself is in any case likely to be a special one for post-Brexit British residents its design is not yet known. What is clear, however, is that when you do apply for it you’ll need to show you are legally resident – either in a job, retired, self-employed, a student or self-supporting.If you have been legally resident in France for at least five years, you can apply directly for permanent residency. Otherwise you will be applying for temporary residency, which you can upgrade later. I am an army veteran who was medically discharged in 2016 with PTSD after 40 years’ service. I live on a boat because I can’t find affordable accommodation in the UK as my only income is an MoD pension.  I also live on a boat to avoid the hassle of UK life. Can I and my UK-registered sail boat stay in EU waters after Brexit? The boat is my only home.Name suppliedAn unusual predicament that touches on both freedom of movement and customs controls. For the remainder of the year, all British nationals are free to come and go as they please in Europe. After that, freedom of movement is unlikely to apply although campaigners are hoping it will apply to a particular group of British nationals who are already fully resident in a EU member state.On the customs aspect, we asked the Royal Yacht Association which said: “The ability for recreational boats together with their equipment and other contents to navigate free of customs procedures and time limits throughout the waters of the European Union is currently dependent on them having customs status of union goods.“In order for a boat to have union status the VAT must be accounted for and if the boat has been imported any applicable customs duty must also have been paid. The owner is then able to move the boat freely through the EU without being subject to a customs procedure, from one point to another within the customs territory of the union, and temporarily out of that territory by sea without alteration of their customs status provided that their union status is proven.“During the transition period the UK and the EU will finalise the UK’s future relationship with the EU and it is only once those negotiations have been concluded that we will know the implications of the end of the transition period and any steps that recreational boaters need to take if they wish to retain union status.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aed9e7a7491c9e2aa402bf0cdc5b894ee22d77f4/0_9_2467_1480/master/2467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04cd63d3f9fedc17b8945f347bbed7a6","title":"sajid javid set to back hs2 at crunch meeting politics live","story":"The chancellor is set to support the controversial rail project at a meeting with Boris Johnson and the transport secretary, Grant ShappsHere are the morning’s main developments:Here are some more opinions from Westminster on HS2 - against and for respectively:Dominic Raab said during the Policy Exchange event that hopefully British citizens would be evacuated “later this evening”. However, in a statement, he has just confirmed that the flight will be tomorrow morning: We are pleased to have confirmation from the Chinese authorities that the evacuation flight from Wuhan airport to the UK can depart at 5am local time on Friday 31 January.The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority. Our embassy in Beijing and consular teams remain in close contact with British nationals in the region to ensure they have the latest information they need.That was a display from Dominic Raab and Mike Pompeo of US-UK unity ahead of Brexit, with disagreements over Huawei, Iran and the Harry Dunn depicted as blips that could be overcome. Instead, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, reiterated that the UK would be “at the front of the line” when it comes to a trade deal, with both parties concurring that this was achievable before November’s presidential election in November. Pompeo said it could deliver “enormous benefits” for both the US and the UK now that the latter was not constrained by the EU. There is a follow up question on Harry Dunn from CBS.Raab says he had a “good conversation with Mike” about it. What changes to the special relationship can be expected post-Brexit, someone else asks. tPompeo says he is optimistic because there were things the UK were required to do as being part of the EU which they no longer have to do. That is fantastic for the US and UK, says the secretary of state. He says there will be “enormous benefits” that accrue to both organisations. Lucy Fisher from the Times says a full trade deal is unlikely before the November US election. Will a sectorial deal be struck instead and if so will it be for the financial sector? Raab says a deal can be done and we should have a “can-do” attitude. Pompeo simply says “I concur”. Jason Groves from the Mail asks if there could be a barter - Prince Andrew for Anne Sacoolas. Pompeo says both situations will be resolved. Raab says there is no barter. And that’s the conclusion of the event. James Landale from the BBC asks Pompeo if the US will make good on its pledge to restrict intelligence-sharing in response to the Huawei decision.Pompeo says the security relationship is deep and will remain but the US will not permit its citizens information to go across a network it is unhappy about. Landale also asked how the special relationship fits in with the case of Harry Dunn and the refusal to extradite Anne Saccolas, who fled the country after being involved in the incident which killed the teenager. Pompeo offers some platitudes and says they are working to resolve the situation. Landale also asks Raab about getting UK citizens out of Wuhan, China. Raab says ideally citizens will be evacuated tonight and insists the UK government is doing its best. On Huawei, Pompeo says permitting a Chinese company tied to the Chinese communist party to access private information creates risk. He says Chinese companies have obligations to the party and party members are investors in Huawei.This is about a model that the Chinese communist party has ...it’s not about a technical back door, they have the front door. He says he is confident the UK and US will find a way to resolve the situation and be able to work together.Raab says the decision protects security and the relationship with security allies, “the five eyes”. Both Raab and Pompeo say there need to be more players in 5G.You can read more on our business blog. Pompeo says the UK should have a close relationship with the EU and Nato, although there will inevitably be disagreements with the EU, which brings a smile to Raab’s face. The special relationship means shared values and being a force for good around the world, says the US secretary of state.Talking about trade arrangements with the US, Raab says he doesn’t want to pre-empt negotiations. Pompeo says it is about reducing friction between the countries, creating ease of travel, ease of each others citizens attending each others schools, ease of travel of capital.On Iran, Pompeo says pressure on Iran’s economy has reduced its capability. Raab says there is scope for rapprochement with Iran but it must be prepared to take the necessary steps. Asked about the Trump deal on Iran, Raab says:I don’t think there is a huge difference between Europeans and Americans ...the question is whether there is political will in Iran. Pompeo says you can only have conversationsdisagreements about the likes of Huawei with countries you have a “deep relationship” with, so it won’t fracture the friendship. Good friends don’t always agree on everything.He says there is a sea of things the countries agree on.Pompeo says there is a “tremendous value” to the US from the relationship with the UK. The Chinese communist party represents the central threat of our times. The US secretary of state talks about the importance of western democratic values, which he contrasts to those of the Chinese government.The Pompeo-Raab conversation has begun (refresh the page to see the livestream embedded at the top of the page). The US secretary of state says he wanted to be here on the date that Brexit takes place but Raab said Brexit day would be “hectic” so he’s here the day before.Raab says Brexit was about pursuing the UK self-interest and self-belief and it’s great to have the US recognising and supporting that.Having the US say it’s all fine by us ...it’s great.He contrasts this with the Obama administration which he says would have put the UK at the back of the queue. The government has said it is working “urgently” with Chinese authorities to ensure citizens in Wuhan can return on a flight “as soon as possible”.We are doing everything we can to get British people in Wuhan safely back to the UK.A number of countries’ flights have been unable to take off as planned including the British repatriation from Wuhan.We are working urgently with the Chinese authorities to ensure that the flight can take off as soon as possible.The flight is planned to touch down at a military base in the UK before passengers are taken to an NHS facility to be quarantined.But the plane has been prevented from leaving China because “we haven’t got the necessary clearances and we are working with the Chinese authorities on securing those”, the spokesman said.Number 10 is not giving away any more than Grant Shapps did in transport questions this morning regarding whether HS2 will go ahead, despite the chancellor’s backing for the high speed rail project."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youThe death toll in China stands at 170, with 7,711 confirmed cases of infections.

Rising columns of plasma, superheated to almost 6,000C (10,800F), show up as bright spots at the centre of each grain – epicentres for the violent release of heat from the sun’s interior to its surface. As the plasma cools, it descends back below the surface via narrow, shadowy channels between neighbouring granules.This intricate level of detail will help improve understanding of the sun’s behaviour and allow its activity cycle to be predicted more accurately.The US National Solar Observatory’s $344m (£265m) telescope features a four-metre mirror – the world’s largest for a solar telescope – and is located at the 3,000-metre (10,000ft) summit of the Haleakalā volcano on the island of Maui.Valentin Pillet, the director of the National Solar Observatory, described the telescope, which had been under construction since 2013, as a “formidable technological achievement”. A major challenge was maintaining the telescope’s primary mirror at ambient temperature while it looked directly at the sun – any temperature deviation causes air turbulence that could ruin the image quality. The heat is intense enough to rapidly melt metal at the mirror’s focal point.Each night, a swimming pool’s worth of ice is emptied into eight tanks. During the day, coolant is routed through the ice tanks and distributed through the observatory by 7.5 miles (12km) of piping. More than 100 air jets are also positioned behind the main mirror.Incoming light from the sun is deflected from the primary mirror into a chamber of mirrors that sits below the observatory’s dome. Here, the light is bounced from mirror to mirror as it is apportioned between spectrometers, polarimeters and other various other instruments. The observatory’s full suite of instruments, which will allow scientists to measure the magnetic field from the sun’s surface up to its outer atmosphere, will come online later this year.The observations could help resolve longstanding mysteries of the sun, including the counterintuitive feature that the corona – the sun’s atmosphere – is heated to millions of degrees when its surface is only 6,000C. Understanding the physics of solar flares and coronal mass ejections could also significantly improve the ability to predict space weather, which can render GPS systems unreliable, take down power grids and knock out communication channels.The release of the images comes as Nasa’s Parker solar probe makes observations from the edge of the sun’s atmosphere, and before the launch of the Solar Orbiter mission, a European Space Agency-Nasa collaboration, next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a529c54769e3ee8f8f1f78beb18f0cea9df9b2f/0_154_3402_2041/master/3402.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=611570886d190ba0aa59d942a704ab53","title":"novak djokovic eases past roger federer australian open straight sets tennis","story":"The longer they linger, the bigger the gap between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, and it has grown to the point where they might never again converge at a point of comparable greatness.The 38-year-old Swiss has done it all, and stands alone for now with a record 20 slams, but losing to Djokovic, six years his junior, in straight sets in the semi-finals of the Australian Open on Thursday night in Melbourne – having shared Centre Court at Wimbledon with him over five sets in one of the great finals only last summer – has pushed the door wide open for the Serb.If Djokovic wins his eighth title here on Sunday, he moves to within three career majors of Federer, whose prospects of adding to his tally are not as strong as they were, and two behind Rafael Nadal, whose castle remains in Paris.Just as the younger Dominic Thiem was too strong for Nadal on Wednesday, so Djokovic’s stamina and strength were always going to stretch Federer, who had already played well over 12 hours to win five matches, two of them five-setters, both of which he could have lost.When he saved seven match points in his quarter-final against Tennys Sandgren, he needed a medical timeout for a groin strain. He had that leg strapped for the semi-final and there were moments in some of the longer rallies in the two hours and 18 minutes in which he and Djokovic traded quality shots when his movement looked limited. Djokovic was pulling away at the end, to win 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-3 and rarely has a scoreline been such an accurate barometer of the facts.The first set was a microcosm of their rivalry. Federer blazed early – three aces in five minutes after half an hour he held to love for 5-2 – before Djokovic worked his way into the story, and then they battled on level terms for awhile before Federer’s resistance waned. Even on two good legs, he would have done well to break down Djokovic’s defence once the fire went out.For nearly 40 minutes, Federer was in near-total control. He’d struck 20 clean winners, eight of them aces. Then he briefly went missing and Djokovic, still fighting his own game, broke him to love. That was the turning point. He gave up only one game in the shootout and set about systematically hurting his stricken rival.Federer had a medical timeout. He was not the same when he came back. As Mats Wilander observed on Eurosport, “It seemed like Novak could feel that Roger couldn’t move in to the corners, so he was trying to extend the rallies to get Federer wide on the backhand, or wide on the forehand and Roger was working against that.“Roger did not serve very well in the tie-breaker in the first set, that was the first time I realised something was slightly wrong. Clearly Roger was OK to put up a great fight. The first two sets were close. If I didn’t think he was injured before I would have never noticed.”In fact he kept them down to 18, about half Federer’s count. After the initial blitz, he soaked up 15 aces and fashioned 11 of his own. The second set was competitive but an air of inevitability entered the equation in the third. Djokovic put six aces past Federer and struck 12 of his 31 winners in the home stretch.As for their mutual bond, Djokovic said, “I hope I made him a 20 per cent better player than what he did to me. He’s one of my biggest two rivals in slams, Roger and Rafa. They made a considerable difference in my mind and how I play. It took a lot of thinking, belief and work to perfect the game and challenge those guys on the bigger stage.”A more youthful challenge awaits him on Sunday – against Alexander Zverev or Dominic Thiem – and he said, “When you’re young you want everything right away. There’s no waiting. They are among the best young players, and have the potential to be there. One thing I lacked when I was younger was patient and trusting the process a little bit more. But that’s how you learn.”These two fine champions have learned so much from each other, sharing the same tenacity and drive, but going about their business on court in such contrasting styles. Like Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier were, they are almost a perfect fit.But their statistics tell the story. Federer won seven of their first 10 matches, between 2006 and 2009 he was 6-4 in front between then and 2011 Novak burst into greatness that year and won seven of their next 10 matches between 2013 and 2015, he led 5-4, plus a walkover up until last night, he was 7-3 ahead. That is a trend that is unlikely to change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a04190588dc5266954fa5733b115b06c55a08669/0_239_4830_2898/master/4830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2b5d0f1962d7215adbb53f943d6d32e","title":"san francisco 49ers super bowl liv team analysis nfl football","story":"Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch have developed a team with almost no weaknesses. The Chiefs will have to be superb to beat them on SundayWhat a remarkable turnaround this season has been for the San Francisco 49ers. A year ago, the team was already well into their offseason. Questions were starting to bubble about whether the coach-quarterback-GM axis of Kyle Shanahan, Jimmy Garoppolo and John Lynch was all promise and no substance.The Niners never wavered. There were no leaks, no dispensing of blame, none of the typical stuff that comes when a franchise has yet to ignite and is picking at the top of the draft again. Instead, they doubled down on their plan. The makings of something were there: the head coach was obviously a schematic savant Lynch said all the right things, and had a defined vision Garoppolo flashed talent. They stuck to the “process”, the most overused word in US sports. And, wow, did it ever work: From a 4-12 record to 13-3 in one year.The Niners have mauled teams on both sides of the ball all season. Only the 2007 Patriots have ranked in the top seven on offense and defense in down-to-down efficiency and failed to win the whole thing. The 49ers enter Sunday’s game seventh in offensive DVOA and third in defensive DVOA.It is that balance that defines this team. The exotic stuff comes on offense: they have paired the quickest running-back group in the league with a erse passing game and all kinds of nifty play-action concepts. Add to that an offensive line that can dance with the best of them and a tight end who’s not only the most efficient route-runner in the NFL but the best blocker of any skill position player.The star of the show is Shanahan, though. Architect of one of the greatest offenses in modern NFL history in Atlanta, it’s taken him a while to get all his pieces in place in San Francisco. This year, however, Shanahan has everything he wants: speed all over the field a weapon who can win one-on-one and an offensive line that prioritizes side-to-side movement over raw power.It’s the system and coach that’s key, not the quarterback. Shanahan has tried to turn Garoppolo into 2017 Alex Smith. Get the ball out on time, and I promise you the players will be open. Just don’t chuck the game away. Garoppolo has been efficient while trying to curb some of the freelancing tendencies that can lead to turnovers – he has 13 interceptions so far this season. When he curbs those base instincts, the Niners offense has been close to unstoppable.Shanahan’s brilliance is not in particular play designs, most of which can be found elsewhere in the league. It’s the timing of the plays he calls. No detail goes unnoticed. The hands of a defensive back here, the body language of the defensive coordinator there. Shanahan sees those little things on tape that lesser coaches miss:Each tip allows the coach to run the same plays over and over again, but sequence them in varying orders to keep his opponents guessing.Things aren’t much different defensively, albeit with more star power. It’s hard to scheme up a pass-rush the way you can a passing game on offense. Either you need superstars up front who can win one-on-one or two-on-one (like the 2007 Giants) or a secondary littered with future Hall of Famers, who take away everything on the back-end and buy the pass-rush an extra couple of beats – think of Seattle’s Legion of Boom. The Niners have tried to build the best of both worlds. They’ve imported that simplistic Seattle scheme on the back-end but added a batch of first-round pass-rushers to the mix.Nick Bosa is the star of the show, a rookie already playing at an All-Pro level. He has a special combination of springs, hands, and tenacity. His relentlessness has infected the entire team they fly around with a recklessness that borders on violence. They’re not out to stop you, they’re here to break you. It’s an old-school style, built in the image of Lynch, who was a bone-crushing safety during his playing days.Lynch has built this roster carefully and methodically, using all the avenues available. The core of their defense has come through the draft – Bosa, Jimmy Ward, Arik Armstead, Fred Warner— with a sprinkling of free agent and trade additions to push it to the next level: Richard Sherman, Dee Ford. All of them have been significant contributors, on and off the field.They built a rudimentary scheme, but one that amplifies the ability of their stars. Playing fast is all that matters. Shut your eyes and you can picture any of the Niners’ 15-wins this season: force turnovers on defense, control the ball on offense. When the Niners have been in trouble it’s been because Garoppolo has thrown a dopey interception or two. Stick to the script, get out the way, and Garoppolo’s teammates have been too overwhelming for anyone to contain.Contrast that with Sunday’s opponents. They have an all-time great quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, already at the top of the NFL just three years into his career. Land such a prospect and everything else slots into place easily, every decision you make as a franchise looks smart.Everything the Chiefs do is about Mahomes and their passing game, a terrifying supernova that’s ready to explode at any time. Only the Mahomes-led crew and the Chiefs’ special teams are a real threat. The defense has talent, but it’s more dependent on inidual matchups than the Niners’ unit.San Francisco have built the most complete roster the NFL has seen in recent years, staying true to the ideals of their general manager and coach. It will take a remarkable Mahomes performance to deny them a Championship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c5263f321fe8a5cb4db40e2ad9625b89385c5f7/176_449_4705_2823/master/4705.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d4bbc40529ad6d7b5ccc048f109ad49","title":"six nations 2020 team by team guide rugby england wales scotland ireland france italy","story":"England’s World Cup seemed to be judged on the no-show in the final against South Africa, the manner in which they overwhelmed Australia and New Zealand in the previous rounds largely forgotten. They had one of the youngest teams in the tournament with Eddie Jones changing direction a year out from Japan and jettisoning some of his more seasoned players. The result was that they played with greater pace, if not invention, and at last had a complementary back row.Playing the two previous Six Nations champions at home – Ireland and Wales – makes them favourites, but much will hinge on their opener in Paris against a France side that should play without fear or inhibition. Jones has made the point that losing World Cup finalists have struggled the year after, but the same could be said of the winners, New Zealand post-2011 excepted.The tournament often marks the end of a cycle, but England will be little changed from Japan, although their Saracens contingent are grieving. Jones has brought in Matt Proudfoot from South Africa to mould the forwards while Simon Amor is a left-field appointment from the sevens circuit to inject unpredictability into the attack. Jones wants England to become the greatest team the world has ever seen. But Europe will do for now.Fabien Galthié plans a remake of Love Story after Les Bleus spent most of the 2010s auditioning for Hammer horror movies. France’s new head coach fears there has been a disconnect with the crowd at the Stade de France and wants to rekindle the fans’ passion for their team. He has invested in youth, looking ahead to the 2023 World Cup which France are hosting having made a hash, on the field, of the 2007 event.They start with England at home and can expect an onslaught in the opening quarter since the visitors’ understanding of Shaun Edwards’s defensive system will put France under immediate strain. In France’s favour they have won the last two Junior World Championships and a feature of their better teams in Europe this season has been aggressive defence complemented by an attacking freestyle that used to be the hallmark of the French, all running angles and offloads. With pace and power behind and, should their conditioning endure for the whole match rather than the first half and a few minutes more, France will be in a position to recapture the past, although this campaign will be about signs of progress.Like Wales, Ireland are starting a new era following the departure of the successful Joe Schmidt, but the difference is they have promoted from within. Andy Farrell is an experienced second-in-command but now has to get used to telling players they are not in the team, such as the in-form scrum-half John Cooney with the established Conor Murray starting against Scotland on Saturday.If little in his demeanour suggests he will have a problem with that, selection itself is another matter. Schmidt approached that part of the job with caution, his paradigms shifting slowly as he gradually phased in young players, and a side that had started the year at the top of the world rankings looked uninspired in Japan. Leinster are unbeaten this season and the nucleus of that team equally adept in defence and attack, including the threats behind of Jordan Larmour, Garry Ringrose and Jonathan Sexton, will be involved in the Six Nations.Ireland were organised under Schmidt, masters at keeping possession, but they largely avoided risk and relied on plays. That should change with Mike Catt, an improviser in his England playing days, masterminding attacking strategy and placing more emphasis on the unstructured. Farrell has two home matches to start his tenure, against Scotland and Wales – who have not won in the tournament in Dublin since 2010 and 2012 respectively – before his return to Twickenham.Italy used to appoint francophiles as their head coaches but Franco Smith, a South African who finished his playing career with Treviso, has taken over from Conor O’Shea – whose four years in charge were notable for structural improvement rather than Six Nations victories in the Six Nations. The Azzurri won 12 of their 100 matches in their first 20 years in the tournament, half of the victories coming against Scotland, who accounted for their two successes on the road, although they drew in Cardiff in 2006.That is an underwhelming record and the side’s talisman for the last 16 years, Sergio Parisse, will only have a walk-on role, saying arrivederci in the final match at home to England. Smith believes statistics hide the improvement in the attitude of his players, forged by playing in the Six Nations and the Pro14, but his desire of finding an Italian way that is distinctive is ambitious. Where to start?Gregor Townsend and Eddie Jones are the only two surviving head coaches from last year, but they had contrasting World Cups. Scotland failed to make the knockout stage after a timid opening-round display against Ireland left them needing to defeat the hosts, who by that stage had more than a nation behind them.Preparations for the Six Nations started badly with Finn Russell, the side’s dynamo, being sent home after he failed to show up for training following a late-night drinking session. Townsend says it is not a case of Finn being finished, but it leaves him further on the back foot as the side prepares for Dublin, a city where the Scots have won only once in the Six Nations, one of just seven successes on the road in 20 years.Adam Hastings, who will replace Russell at No 10, is a player growing in influence and the more reliable goal-kicker in the post-Greig Laidlaw era, but for a side that does not have the most powerful tight five around, the loss of the mercurial Russell is wounding, following reports of his discontent over tactics in Japan. If referees clamp down on slowing the ball down at the breakdown, Scotland will be a threat. If they don’t, they won’t.The holders are not expected to emerge from the long shadow cast by Warren Gatland, at least by bookmakers who reckon youthful France and Ireland will finish closer to England. Wayne Pivac is Wales’s first new coach for 12 years, a change from the times when 12 months was closer to the average tenure, but the New Zealander does not have much in common other than his nationality with Gatland, who took Wales back to the 1970s in terms of success, if not style.Wales were underrated under Gatland: beside a defence masterminded by Shaun Edwards, who will make a quick return to Cardiff with France, they had no one outstanding characteristic but became hard to beat. They were not reliant on one part of their game having to function and their grand slam success last year was based on an ability to chase a game, as they showed against France and England, and defend a lead, which they did at Scotland and at home to Ireland.Pivac has pledged to make Wales’s attack more stiletto than bludgeon, although he starts without three of last year’s first-choice backs. His first task is to maintain the indomitable spirit that took them to the title and the World Cup semi-finals. Achieve that, make them more cutting edge and Wales will be contenders again.• This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

Thanks for readingemailingtweeting. We’ll be back tomorrow with coverage of the second semi-final between Alex Zverev and Dominic Thiem. Jamie Murray also plays for a place in the mixed doubles final. Bye!In case you’ve missed it, here’s more on what happened in two gripping women’s semi-finals earlier:A match report for you:It could have definitely gone a different way. He started off really well, I was pretty nervous at the beginning. Respect to Roger for coming out tonight, he was obviously hurt and wasn’t close to his best in terms of movement. It was not the right mindset from me at the beginning of the match, I was looking at how he was moving rather than executing my shots. I managed to dig my way back and it was very important to win that first set. Djokovic wags his finger in the air and beats his chest. The pair exchange pleasantries at the net before Federer departs the Rod Laver Arena. He’ll be having nightmares tonight about the way the first set slipped away from him and, given Federer’s physical problems, once Djokovic was ahead there was only going to be one winner. Djokovic will play either Alex Zverev or Dominic Thiem in the final on Sunday. It would take a supreme performance from the younger challenger to deny Djokovic on the court where he has produced some of the finest displays of his career.15-0 ... 30-0 ... the pair then move each other right and left and right and left and Federer emerges victorious with an unreturned bullet of a backhand. And then a crunching cross-court forehand from Federer gets him to 30-all! Two of his best shots of the match. He’s saved the best for last. But a stubborn Djokovic comes right back, as he always does, and it’s match point, 40-30. Djokovic misses the first serve, then bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounces the ball before landing his second, and Federer’s shot flops into the net! Djokovic has got the better of Federer for the fourth time in an Australian Open semi-final and he’s now only one win away from a record-extending eighth title! Much of the talk this fortnight was about Rafael Nadal potentially matching Federer’s grand slam record of 20 but Djokovic is now on the verge of closing within two of Nadal and three of Federer. He may well end up being the greatest of them all.Djokovic looks in the mood to finish this on Federer’s serve. It’s 30-all. But there’s a wry smile from Djokovic when he can’t make it match point. Federer has game point at 40-30 and Djokovic then whistles wide. But the defending champion is about to step up to serve for a place in his eighth Australian Open final ...“Given Nadal’s loss to Them last night and the fact that Thiem has beaten him on clay once each of the last three years, 2020 Paris is by no means a given,” says Shankar Mony. “And Novak does look healthiest and best of equals. For my money, Novak is the most complete of the three and should get to 20 and beyond, as deserved richly.”And this from Peter Kane: “The debate is close to over as regards the greatest of all time, Djoko’s professional record is better all but for the slams. But critically his head to head is better against both Nadal and Federer. And if he stays healthy, he has 5 years on Federer to close the slam tally. Djoko is the GOAT..” Djokovic whizzes through another service game and it’s now just a matter of putting the finishing touches on this win ..Federer seems safe at 40-15, is pulled back to 40-30, and then deuce when he fluffs his lines and nets a weak backhand. It’s the first deuce game of the set. Wife Mirka grimaces in the stands. So does an ailing Federer as he stretches his aching body. It’s break point. And Federer is flailing when Djokovic lands possibly the decisive blow in this match with a looping forehand that HawkEye confirms grazed the line.“I wish people would give Djokovic the support and respect that he deserves (in Australia and elsewhere) as he is a competitor like no other that contributed immensely to the sport and today’s match is no exception,” writes Katerina Hemalova. I think if he wasn’t playing Federer here he would be getting more love from the crowd: they do respect what Djokovic has done here in winning seven titles, but cheering against Federer is almost deemed sacrilegious in tennis. There’s a smattering of applause as Djokovic holds to 15.Federer produces a hat-trick of aces to defiantly hold to love.Of course a great subplot to this match is the race to finish as the GOAT. If Djokovic goes on to win the title, he’ll be on 17 slams, two behind Nadal on 19 (who’ll surely make it 20 at the French Open) and three behind Federer. And Djokovic looks as if he has the time and health on his side to surpass both. Who do you think will end top of tennis’s great triumvirate? But back to on-court matters, where a hold apiece makes it 1-1, before Djokovic comes through a slightly trickier game to 30. Once again most of the spectators can’t bring themselves to applaud Djokovic getting another game on the board. Though the Serbian supporters back their man with a “Nole! Nole! Nole!”Federer’s in danger at 30-all and again at deuce. The alarm bells are then ringing at full volume when Djokovic produces a stinging return of serve for set point. Surely Federer isn’t coming back from two sets down? But he’s going to have to try, because more outstanding play from Djokovic, as he chases down a drop shot before sending it past Federer, secures the set. The Rod Laver Arena falls virtually silent. But Djokovic – fists pumping and eyes bulging – is roaring.This set hasn’t had the wild swings in momentum of the first, but it’s absorbing nonetheless, as it moves steadily to its denouement with both players attempting to out-serve each other. From Federer’s love hold to a 15 hold for Djokovic, who’s dropped only two points on serve in this set. Federer must hold to avoid going two sets to love down. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game, as the ace count hits 12. A love hold will give Djokovic something to think about. Credit to Federer for the way he’s hauled himself off the canvas after the way he was beaten up by Djokovic at the end of the first set. Federer is definitely attacking the net more in this set, an approach that is bringing some reward, despite Djokovic’s immense passing ability. That said, on game point to Djokovic here, Federer can’t produce any fireworks at the net and it’s another straightforward hold for the Serb.Gasps as the 38-year-old Federer shows lighting reactions at the net to deal with Djokovic’s thunderbolts and it’s 30-all. Make that 30-40. Djokovic doesn’t take advantage of the break point when he could – and perhaps should – have done better. Instead he biffs a backhand long. Deuce. And from there Federer fights for the hold.A tactics change-up helps Federer hold to 30 with some serve-volleying. Cue some more “let’s go Roger, let’s go” inanity – but given Federer’s wounds are still raw from the first set the chants seem more in hope than belief. Djokovic then darts through another service game, holding to 15, and that’s five successive holds – a different story to the first set. Fancy a stat attack? Sure you do.A love hold for Djokovic as the sun sets on Rod Laver. Into the night we go ...This could be about to go from bad to worse for Federer. It’s 15-40 on his serve. He can’t afford to go a break and a set down, especially if he’s feeling it physically. He grits his teeth and gets to deuce. Djokovic is shrugging and shaking his head when he misses the chance to get a third break point of the game. Djokovic’s forehand is then called out but it was a very late call, Djokovic decides to challenge, and HawkEye confirms the defending champion went wide. Federer steadies himself with a valuable hold.Djokovic starts the set with a comfortable hold. And here’s that point at 5-1 in the breaker for your viewing pleasure:So for the second match in a row, Federer has called for a rare medical timeout, something that he said after the quarter-finals is a “sign of weakness”. He must be hurting. But not only physically, given the way Djokovic broke him mentally in that first set. Djokovic also decides to see a doctor and takes a pill for something. It’s all going on. But Federer is back and Djokovic will get this second set under way...Outstanding play from Djokovic brings up five set points. He produces quite possibly the shot of the match with a delightful drop-shot around the net post while on the run and the ball bounces in. And a ripping return gives Djokovic the set! After Federer had led 4-1, 40-0! But you just can’t beat Djokovic, the Superman of tennis, even when he’s down.Neither player has lost a tie-break this year, so something’s gotta give. My money’s on Djokovic, given he’s got the momentum and has a habit of getting under the skin of Federer when it matters most. He rattles through the first three points for a 3-0 lead, before Federer gets on the board with a rasping winner. That will have felt good. But the next point won’t, because Federer meekly nets. An ace from Djokovic and he changes ends very much in command leading 5-1 ...Djokovic is serving to take this set into a tie-break, which is, incidentally, how the first set of their Wimbledon final was decided too. Djokovic won that breaker 7-5. And he sets up another here by holding to 30 with a stinging serve out wide that Federer can only prod into the net."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e681aa00a2393b61604cca5350b96d1a9aeb9d35/0_280_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fc585332e4c67c444488995c5375fc0","title":"whats the minimum specification for someone buying a pc","story":"David asks how best to tell if a PC is fast enough for community groups on a limited budgetI am working on a project that helps various groups in the community to become more PC proficient, and some clients now wish to purchase their own systems for the first time. What is the best advice to give them about specifications etc, bearing in mind their finite budgets?A user who wants a desktop PC to deal with email and social media, office files, surfing the web and streaming some video will also need to buy peripherals, including a monitor. Some will need a printer. Often the advice will be to get the best PC possible, but they may not get the full benefit if other parts of the system are too compromised. DavidAlmost every PC on the market will perform basic tasks such as writing emails and browsing the web. Even cheap laptops can run Microsoft Office and its rival suites, which are relatively lightweight by today’s standards. Most can also do simple photo and video editing, though rendering and other video processing tasks can take a very long time. The problem is not so much the type of task as the resources required by the software and the size of your files.Any PC should be able to handle a one-page letter and post messages on Facebook. Editing 500-page illustrated books or Excel spreadsheets with millions of cells is a different proposition.Either way, it’s better to have too much power than too little. It makes everyday computing more comfortable, and provides some future-proofing. Peripherals are peripheral, and replaceable.I don’t want to repeat last week’s description of the desktop’s advantages over laptops in terms of expandability, reparability and upgradeability, but someone on a finite budget can start with a cheap refurbished desktop and improve it as they go along. But this is only worthwhile if the CPU is fast enough to last a few years, when you can replace the PC and keep the peripherals.Short of replacing the motherboard, most desktop PCs are easy to upgrade, once you overcome the fear factor. Often there are YouTube videos to show you how it’s done.Second hand printers are even less attractive, unless they are proper business machines or laser printers. Consumer inkjets are cheap and disposable because the real money is made supplying ink cartridges.You may be able to source hardware cheaply, from refurbishers, or free. A worthy community group might be able to get a local newspaper to run their story, along with an appeal for unwanted hardware. You will probably have to collect it, and you may be offered quite a lot of junk. However, people can develop hardware skills on junk PCs, and extract parts to sell on eBay. If not, securely wiping hard drives and recycling old PCs is still a useful social function.Thanks to two long-term trends, most PC buyers can now afford a system that will run Microsoft Windows 10 reasonably well. First, as always, components have become cheaper and more powerful thanks to technological and manufacturing advances. Second, Microsoft has spent a decade making Windows more efficient. Today, Windows 10 usually runs on PCs that could run Vista well in 2006 or Windows 7 from 2009. Not many operating systems can claim that.But the fact that Windows 10 runs in 2GB of RAM does not make it a good idea. You get much better performance with 4GB, which (roughly) provides 2GB for Windows and 2GB for browser tabs.When a Windows 10 upgrade arrives, you need enough room for the download, the new version of the operating system and the previous version, all at the same time. The old version is stored in the Windows.old folder so that you can restore it if something goes wrong. PCs should update correctly if given extra space on a USB thumbdrive or an external hard drive. However, if you start with only 64GB, you may end up running the Disk Clean-up app (remember to click “Clean up system files”) and deleting stuff to make space for updates.Today, I think the minimum specification for Windows 10 or Linux Mint is 4GB of memory and a 120GB SSD, but everyone should aim for 8GB and a 240GB or larger SSD. Video editors, photographers, gamers and “power users” will want, and often need, more.Picking a processor is the trickiest part of buying a PC, because their relative merits are far from obvious. Real-world processor performance is influenced by the amount of memory, the type of storage and the cooling system, which includes the fans and the case. (In thin laptops, the CPU can be throttled to stop it from overheating, reducing performance in the process.)No one who sits down at an unknown PC can tell which CPU it’s using without looking it up. Often, differences don’t become evident until you have real work to do, or try to play a demanding game. If you just run Notepad, a slow system might look like fast one. If you try to reprocess an MP4 video, the fast one may take a few minutes and the slow one hours.Businesses can justify buying PCs that are fast enough to run their business processes because time is money. It’s worth doing a task just a few seconds faster if it’s repeated dozens or hundreds of times a day over many years. Home users usually don’t know how much time their PCs are wasting, and if they did, they probably wouldn’t care. If you’re only using a PC for a few hours a week, you won’t spend a fortune getting a browser to load five seconds faster.There’s also a subjective aspect: speed is what you are used to. For example, one of our seven-year-old Core i5 laptops seems a bit slow from the relative height of my six-core desktop, but some visitors have been impressed by its speed. They have a different concept of “normal”.So, from a psychological point of view, your clients should try to buy PCs that are as fast as the ones they are using now, or faster. Using what feels like a slow PC can be frustrating, whatever its real performance.The good news is that lots of old desktop processors still perform well by today’s standards. In response to the market’s move to ultra-thin laptops, Intel has been developing chips that use less power, generate less heat, need less cooling and provide longer battery life. Since 2005, it has focused on providing more performance per watt, rather than more raw performance. As a result, the Core i5-2500 that came out a decade ago is still faster than some new laptop chips because it runs at a TDP of 95W while they run at 15W or even 9W.There are hundreds of different processors in the refurbished PC market, but you can look up each chip’s score on the PassMark benchmark and compare it with your own PC’s score. Chips with significantly better scores should run faster. (Small percentage differences don’t matter.)For a Windows 10 PC that gets more-than-casual use, I think a PassMark score of around 2,500 is the minimum, and anything over 5,000 would probably be acceptable to most of your clients. Doubling that score would make it suitable for me, and doubling it again would satisfy a gamer.In general, you should be looking at Intel Core chips in the ex-corporate refurbished market, and Core i5 versions are often the best value. If you’re buying new, aim for the highest spec you can justify. Intel Core chips are still very good but the AMD Ryzen equivalents may be better value.Have you got a question?

Now advocates worry the men are on the brink of death.The men have applied for asylum in the US and are waiting for an immigration judge to rule on their cases.Advocates have filed an official complaint against Ice, condemning the organization for not providing the men with proper medical treatment during the strike. Two men have reportedly been force-fed – an act that multiple medical associations and human rights groups in the United States have said is inhumane and unethical.A second complaint was filed alleging Ice has not released the medical records of two of the men for independent review, a right that exists for those in Ice detention to ensure they are getting proper treatment.The men are all from south Asia and are seeking asylum in the US out of fear of religious persecution or retaliation for their political beliefs back home. Advocates say all five have friends and family in the United States who are waiting for them to be released.One of the men, Mehla, 22, who wished to go by a pseudonym for fear of repercussions if he was deported, told the  he fled to the US after he was pushed out of India for converting to Christianity. After he fled, members of the RSS, a rightwing Hindu nationalist party, came to his family’s home looking for him and threatened violence if he returned.After arriving in Germany with help from a family member, Mehla then went to Spain, where he took a flight to Mexico. He eventually crossed the Mexican border into the United States. Mehla was detained by Ice on 21 January last year, and has remained in detention since.“I applied for asylum. I am not a criminal. I never did any crime. I’ve never been to jail,” Mehla said in Hindi through a translator. “My demand is that they release me so I can fight my case outside detention.”Mehla is one of hundreds of thousands of migrants who have crossed the southern border in recent years to seek asylum. The US is obliged to allow migrants to go through the asylum application process if they fear persecution at home.Historically, those who apply for asylum in the US have been able to wait out the application process, which can take up to two years, outside detention if a judge approves a release on parole or bond.But legal advocates say migrants are being routinely denied parole or bond, meaning they are indefinitely held in Ice detention until their cases are heard before an immigration judge.“It’s just inhuman to keep these people for so many months in detention,” said Victoria Mesa-Estrada, senior staff attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has filed a lawsuit on behalf of migrants seeking parole.Mesa-Estrada said “immigration detention is a profitable business, especially in a state like Louisiana.” Ice turned eight state prisons and local jails in Louisiana into migrant detention facilities in 2019, though the number of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border started declining in the fall. The detention facilities, such as the one in Jena, tend to be in rural areas hours away from the urban centers.Multiple hunger strikes have occurred at Ice detention facilities in the deep south in the wake of the alleged mass denials of bond and parole.Mehla and the other men started their hunger strike on 1 November last year. Mehla said he weighed 161lb before the strike and now weighs 116lb. All five men – who range from early 20s to mid-30s – are in wheelchairs because they are too weak to walk.Advocates say two of the men have been force-fed, which requires a judge’s approval, via a tube that is inserted through the nostril and passed down to the stomach. The process is painful, especially if a person is resisting.Ice first revealed it was force-feeding migrants who went on hunger strike last January, when it confirmed at least six detainees were force-fed through nasal tubes. The migrants on hunger strike at that time were in Texas, Florida, Arizona and California.Michelle Iglesias, an Ice contract physician based in El Paso, Texas, testified in August at a hearing to allow two men from India to be force-fed that Ice regulations required force-feeding if it was necessary to prevent hunger strikes from starving themselves to death.“There wouldn’t be anyone in a hospital who would do it,” Iglesias said, according to Texas Monthly.Ice did not respond to requests for comment.Michelle Graffeo, a volunteer who visits two of the men every Sunday, said Ice keeps the feeding tube, which migrants call “the pipe”, in the body for as long as three weeks at a time.Graffeo said that for one of the men being force-fed, the process was much worse than the pain of hunger.Mehla has not been force-fed, but is worried that it may come to that point. “I’m scared of that, but I can’t do anything,” he said. “If they’re going to do a force-feeding, I can’t stop them.”Two of the men on hunger strike are now voluntarily drinking Boost nutritional supplement, though they refuse all other food, Graffeo said. One has been transferred to a facility in El Paso, while the last two men are being held in isolation, Graffeo learned last Sunday.Despite the potential health consequences and the pain of being on strike, Mehla said that he will continue his protest.n “The day I will start eating and drinking is the day I start being free,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e0a2a57b22edb825c00af91fb23995056de44fe/0_82_6008_3604/master/6008.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9563fef2218414e301c9a232c12d40d8","title":"coronavirus hundreds stranded wuhan uk evacuation flight delayed","story":"Dominic Raab confirms China has given permission for takeoff at 5am local timeHundreds of Britons stranded in the Chinese region at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak will be flown home early on Friday morning, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has confirmed.A plane was due to leave locked-down Wuhan on Thursday morning, evacuating about 200 Britons to the UK, where they would be quarantined for two weeks at a secure NHS facility.But the plans were scuppered late on Wednesday as Chinese authorities had yet to grant the plane permission for takeoff, leaving British officials scrambling to negotiate.On Thursday Rabb confirmed the plane would take off at 5am local time. He said: “We are pleased to have confirmation from the Chinese authorities that the evacuation flight from Wuhan airport to the UK can depart at 0500 local time on Friday 31 January. The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority. Our Embassy in Beijing and consular teams remain in close contact with British nationals in the region to ensure they have the latest information they need.” The death toll of the virus, which has spread to at least 16 countries, has reached 170, and there are 7,711 confirmed cases in China.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.The virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of January 30, the death toll in China stands at 170, with 7,711 confirmed cases of infections. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside\u0026nbspChina, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, with the more than 70 people tested for the virus all proving negative. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World\u0026nbspHealth\u0026nbspOrganization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital.Nick Gibb, the UK school standards minister, told Sky News: “There are some difficult issues that are being negotiated at very senior levels between the British government and the Chinese government. Our priority is to ensure the safety and welfare of British nationals in Wuhan and ensure they do return to the UK as soon as possible.”Gibb confirmed the plan was for them to be taken to an NHS facility on their return, where they would be kept for 14 days to make sure that they did not have symptoms of the virus. He said the flight was “certainly coming to a military base in the UK and then the British nationals will go to the NHS facility for 14 days of quarantine”.Any passengers displaying symptoms of the virus – which include a sore throat, fever and breathing difficulties – will be barred from boarding the UK-bound flight. Those that do make it onboard will have to sign contracts agreeing to the 14-day quarantine.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.Diplomatic efforts are continuing over the efforts of British families including Chinese passport holders to leave the country together. Dual nationals face being trapped in the Wuhan region.A British woman in the region who claimed she was told she would have to leave her three-year-old son behind if she flew out because he had a Chinese passport said the Foreign Office was in discussions with counterparts in the country about her situation.Natalie Francis, originally from York, said on Wednesday that Foreign Office staff in London told her that she could leave on a flight but that her son, Jamie, must stay. She said she was told “nothing can be done”.Later on Thursday the World Health Organization’s emergency committee will reconvene in Geneva to decide whether to declare an international public health emergency in response to the outbreak. The organisation said on Wednesday that “the whole world needs to be on alert”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9f4f9305d4f6b5f1b1e7a117bef99719b41e510/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6e76cebe37c3441f3809500dd59db74","title":"indian primary school faces sedition charge after play about citizenship law","story":"Children aged nine and 10 were interrogated by police after allegedly anti-government performanceThe Indian police are investigating a primary school for sedition over a student play which voiced opposition to the prime minister and his controversial new citizenship law.Students aged nine and 10 at Shaheen school in Bidar, in the state of Karnataka, were interrogated by police over several days for putting on a play that had a theme allegedly opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and included “slurs” against prime minister Narendra Modi.The headteacher of the school, Yusuf Ahamed, expressed outrage that both students and teachers had been questioned by the police over the play.“Police have been visiting the school on a daily basis over the past three days and inquiring about the children and their teachers,” he told local media. “They are being treated like anti-nationals.”India’s new citizenship law, which was passed in December, has been accused of discriminating against Muslims and undermining the secular basis of the Indian constitution, offering an accelerated pathway of citizenship for those who are from all religions except Islam.Footage from the five-minute theatrical performance by the Shaheen students, which showed some pupils discussing the fears faced by Muslims due to the CAA and singing a Bollywood song that has become a protest rallying cry, had gone viral on social media and prompted a member of Modi’s BJP party to file an official complaint.Police have charged senior management at the school with provocation, sedition and promotion of enmity. While several children were questioned, none were charged.Bidar police chief T Sreedhara said: “We have started an investigation into the complaint by an activist who alleged that the play criticised and disrespected Modi.”The charge of sedition, which is based on a British colonial era law, has increasingly been used against those protesting against the CAA in a bid to frame their actions as anti-nationalist. Last week, dozens of women in the state of Uttar Pradesh were charged with sedition for staging a peaceful sit-in against CAA.There are fears that in conjunction with plans to carry out a national register of citizens (NRC) across India, it will only be the country’s 200 million Muslims who will have to provide documentation to prove their Indian nationality or face the threat of detention or deportation. It has led to one of India’s biggest periods of unrest for over forty years, with millions taking to the streets every week in protest against the CAA and NRC."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97cc73ed3d56b7073ab21a8f5700ae0fb937075e/0_101_1152_691/master/1152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e087d8ffc4c30c5cc929d2e504166e0e","title":"indian state school has two teachers a cook and one pupil","story":"Shy seven-year-old girl is the only student after exodus to private schools in rural BiharEach day that seven-year-old Janhavi Kumari arrives at school, her red bag slung over her shoulder, she receives a celebrity welcome. It is not simply that this shy Dalit girl is the star pupil – she is also the only pupil.For the past year, this tiny rural school with pink walls, located in the village of Mansa Bigha, Gaya district, in the Indian state of Bihar, has remained open solely to provide Janhavi with the education she craved, providing her with two teachers and a cook who makes lunch most days.“I have learned to write my name in English and could even tell you the name of fruits and colours in English,” whispered a shy Janhavi, “but I have no friends to study, play and talk with.”Schoolteacher Priyanka Kumari said she was “very impressed” with the commitment of her sole pupil, who comes from an Indian caste who have long faced discrimination and historically had poor access to education. “Little Janhavi is very prompt,” she said. “She has never missed her class right since she got admission in our school in the last session. We also eagerly wait for her every day as her absence means no work for us to do all day.”The primary school, which has been running since 1972, was not always empty of pupils, but a recent growing mistrust about the standard of government schools led to an exodus of students to nearby private institutions. Despite the best efforts of the local administration to convince parents to keep their children in state schools, offering everything from bicycles, uniforms and shoes to schoolbags and free lunches, the government-run classrooms have continued to empty.However, coming from a poverty-stricken family from the lower Paswan caste (also known as Dusadh) for Janhavi, whose father works at a petrol pump and her mother is a housewife, the school fees were unaffordable and so this small local school was her only avenue for education. When Janhavi enrolled at the start of this year, the community made a decision that her education alone was worth the cost of keeping the school going.“How could we have closed down the school? It would have been denial of justice to the poor girl had we shut it down. She too has the right to study,” the local village council chief, Dharmraj Paswan, said.Janhavi’s mother, Pinki Kumari, said she was overjoyed that the school had kept functioning to teach only her daughter. “We are very happy,” she said. “We are so poor … we couldn’t pay hefty fees to private schools. If it wasn’t for the school’s support, my daughter would have been left illiterate.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4153308.1580200203!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus plans to evacuate irish citizens from china","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMedical workers in protective gear talk with a woman suspected of being ill with  the coronavirus at a health station in Wuhan, central China’s Hubei Province, on Monday.

It is estimated there are eight Irish citizens in the affected region, which has been in effective lockdown since the Chinese authorities imposed severe transport restrictions in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.On Monday, the mayor of Wuhan, in Hubei, acknowledged criticism of his handling of the crisis, and offered to resign. There is growing anger among residents that they were not informed earlier about the risk posed by the outbreak, which is thought to have begun in December.The number of confirmed cases has reached almost 3,000, with 400 of these critical. The number of suspected cases now stands at more than 5,700, but experts believe thousands more could eventually be infected.Stocks markets tumbled worldwide yesterday following concerns about the possible economic impact of the coronavirus.ConcernMembers of the Chinese community in Ireland have expressed concern about the presence here of a tour party from the region of the country where the coronavirus originated.The group left China before restrictions were imposed on travel there, came to Britain and then travelled on to Ireland on the ferry from Holyhead at the weekend. Chinese social media posts show a woman member of the group posing at various landmarks, including Trinity College in Dublin and the Titanic Centre in Belfast. “We are the only tour from Wubei that can travel in UK. That’s not easy,” the woman posted on Weibo, a social media site. She also posted a picture from the Holyhead ferry, on which members of her group had played poker.While there is no evidence the group posed any health threat, its presence in Ireland prompted criticism on Chinese social media. One poster warned the community in Ireland, and in particularly Chinese restaurants, to “be aware” of their presence.Surgical masksMedical suppliers are reporting a big jump in demand for surgical masks in response to the coronavirus outbreak in China, with some Dublin stores saying they have run out of stocks.Demand has been particularly high among the Chinese community, especially from those who travelled home to mark the Chinese New Year at the weekend.The Department of Health said its National Public Health Emergency Team met on Monday to review the ongoing preparedness of the Irish health system for any cases of the virus that occur in Ireland. A statement gave no details of the group’s deliberations but pointed out that no confirmed cases had occurred here.Waterford Institute of Technology said one of its students was in self-isolation after travelling from Wuhan at the weekend.

Their warehouse in Northern Ireland is yards from the Donegal border. Photograph: Freya McClements From the outside, it looks like any other warehouse inside, is a garden of flowers hidden right on the Border.Twice a week lorries arrive from the Netherlands bearing their cargoes of sunflowers and carnations, roses and tulips when full, the rows and rows of fresh-cut flowers are spread the length and breadth of the warehouse floor.Johnson Produce, owned by husband and wife Bill and Majella Johnson, is as close to the Border as it’s possible to get.Their side of the Coney Road in Derry is in Northern Ireland the other side of the road is Muff, in Co Donegal.“People come up and ask, ‘Are you in the North or the South’?” says Majella. “We’re just about in the North and no more.”For the last 3½ years, they’ve given the same answer when asked how Brexit will affect their business.He adds: “In recent times, life in this part of the world has just been seamless across the Border. People didn’t really think about it at all, and that was the big fear, that that way of life would be stopped. That’s not the case now.”The Johnson’s flowers are dispatched almost equally between Northern Ireland and the Republic they are the main suppliers of flowers in the northwest of Ireland, with deliveries as far south as Fermanagh and Cavan, and as far west as Sligo.Their flowers are bought by ferry from the Netherlands to Harwich in the east of England, then are driven to Holyhead for the crossing to Dublin and then they are driven on to Derry via the border at Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone.“I think most people have just switched off now, they think it’s all over, and especially when you read the English press they think it’s all sorted now, but on this side of the Irish Sea it’s all to play for still.”‘Less worried’They are in a better position than most. As importers, with the threat of a hard Border removed, “when the lorry gets to the Border at Aughnacloy it will have to come straight on up,” says Bill.“We’re probably less worried than we were, but a lot of companies, especially the exporters, they must be really worried.”Bill and Majella set up their business 25 years ago. Bill, from the northeast of England, met Majella in Zambia, where he was working as a flower grower, and decided to set up their flower business in Majella’s home town of Derry.“I remember at the time we were going round all the flower shops in Donegal and Derry trying to work out if there was a need for the business, so I had maps and questionnaires with me,” he says.“I only had an old car which was forever breaking down, so there were a lot of wires all over the place, and I remember crossing the Border and the soldiers ripping the car apart because they thought I was on some sort of reconnaissance mission.”“You hear people saying it’s put a united Ireland back on to the agenda but I don’t know if that’s even true. I think the politicians have one idea of how life’s going, but most people just want to live their lives as they’ve always lived them.”In the 3½ years, the word “uncertainty” has been oft-repeated on the Border. As the UK’s departure from the EU approaches, that uncertainty is perhaps less sharply-felt still lacking, however, is certainty.“I definitely wouldn’t be relaxed,” says Bill. “I think there still could be huge problems ahead. We’re a net importer into Ireland, so our position’s probably a bit more straightforward.“In a year’s time, everyone will have a better idea.”The UK will leave the EU on Friday on Saturday morning the Johnsons say “we won’t be celebrating or commiserating. It’ll just be the same as ever”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

The children are reaching out to shake hands in the murals, based on a poem called No More. The message is clear: the next generation wants no part in the violence of the past.This mural was unveiled 10 years ago, but the recent political ructions caused by Brexit in the North have stirred new concerns and tensions within the loyalist community, particularly among the younger generation.Loyalists oppose a trade border in the Irish Sea, the compromise agreed by British prime minister Boris Johnson and the EU in October that paves the way for the UK’s orderly departure from the EU on Friday.Loyalists see the new border in symbolic terms as eroding their political identity as unionists and British subjects of the crown.They see the new customs and regulatory frontier on the Irish Sea not as London, Dublin and Brussels see it – a compromise to avoid a hard Irish land Border that could have sparked republican anger and potentially violence – but as a step to Irish economic unity.For this they blame Johnson, who vowed at the DUP conference in 2018 not to create any economic barriers in the Irish Sea. Their anger is not helped by the confused messages from Johnson and UK officials about the checks required on goods moving between the North and Britain after Brexit.Days after Johnson said there would “emphatically” be no checks on trade across the Irish Sea, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, on a visit to Belfast on Monday, said checks on goods entering the North from Britain were “indispensable” consequences of the deal.‘Suck it up’Wilson says there is “a lot of anger” in the loyalist community that Johnson “totally betrayed” the British people of Northern Ireland.“This isn’t what I signed up for: to be told by the British government to just ‘suck it up, and too bad this is the way it is going to be’.”After the deal was unveiled in October a series of public meetings and rallies brought together a broad sweep of unionists and loyalists to protest against the deal they call the “betrayal act”.Wilson says Johnson’s deal was a “complete somersault”, and “the ultimate sell-out” which breaches the 1998 Belfast Agreement that underpins the peace process.“Economically he is tying us to the Irish Republic, which is in the EU. It might seem like it is the EU but that’s not the way the loyalist people look at it: they look at it as we are being tied to an economic united Ireland, which was not in the Good Friday agreement.”Wilson fears a repeat of the 2012-13 flag protests when loyalists protested over the limited number of days the union flag was flown over Belfast’s City Hall. He said the protests left hundreds of young Loyalists with criminal records that hurt their future prospects.“Those sort of things are not realistic anymore. I would hope that there are a few things up our sleeves that we could do, but I wouldn’t want to ulge it now. It is hard to explain how you feel when you have been betrayed by your own prime minister.”The former member of Red Hand Commando – a group affiliated with the Ulster Volunteer Force that was responsible for 500 murders in the Troubles – is clear there is “no appetite” to return to the violence of the past.However, Wilson is fearful of the impact of the “armchair generals” and “Facebook warriors” provoking the anger of younger loyalists via well-followed social media channels, some of which are saying “we will not be the generation to fail Northern Ireland”.“I couldn’t tell you where it’s going to go, to tell you the truth,” Wilson says.Criminal elementsEarlier, Wilson had shared his concerns on how Brexit might be used by some criminal elements within the loyalist community during a talk on post-conflict Northern Ireland with a group of US students hosted by Queen’s University.Some in the loyalist community would “saber-rattle”, he warned, speaking alongside Sinn Féin Belfast city councillor and republican Séanna Walsh, who famously read out the IRA statement announcing the end of its armed campaign.“This is not about their loyalism or their Britishness. This about giving them a reason to exist so that they can turn around and can continue to do their drug-dealing, their gangsterism, their money-lending.” These people would “love nothing better than a conflict to start up again because it will mask what they are doing”.He said “loyalism is not in a good place at the moment”.East of Belfast on Bangor’s loyalist Kilcooley estate – one of the biggest in the North – Alison Blayney, who runs the Kilcooley Women’s Centre (part-funded with EU money), says younger loyalists who are active on social media are “hopping mad” and feel “hugely betrayed” over the Brexit deal, which they see as “a one-way route to an economic united Ireland”.She does not believe there will be violence from the loyalist community in response to it: she feels people are “passed that stage” and “wise to the fact that it doesn’t achieve what it used to”.“They are moving towards thinking things through, thinking their politics through, but how they channel that I am not sure. It is a worrying time because I think they won’t accept it.”Blayney is hopeful that the EU and UK can tweak the Irish Sea border arrangements in this year’s trade talks, but she warns against the “dangerous words” being used on the checks.“It’s dangerous terminology because no one really understands what is going to happen because there are different messages coming out.”DivisionsAt Ledley Hall Boys and Girls Club in east Belfast, young loyalists are worried that Sinn Féin is trying to take advantage of the isions over Brexit in the North to push for a Border poll on Irish unity. The party has pledged to secure a poll within five years as one of its manifesto promises south of the Border in the run-up to the February 8th general election.This, as loyalists see it, will inevitably cause tensions between the North’s two communities. “Sinn Féin’s election posters will be ‘we got the sea border, next we are going for the Border poll.’ We will be reminded of it every day,” said one of the youth club’s workers, who only wanted to be identified as ‘KC’.“Anything that we take as a win they take as a loss, so if they are taking it as a win we will be wary of it.”Nationalists will, he says, see the Irish Sea border as a “financial united Ireland” and “the first step to a united Ireland” – a prospect that loyalists abhor.“The words ‘united Ireland’ to a unionist or a loyalist is just petrifying because you have been told by your granny growing up, ‘it is never going to happen, not in your lifetime’, and now it possibly could,” he said.Wayne Gilmour (25), a self-declared loyalist activist from a working-class background who was a regular demonstrator in the flags protests, sees the Brexit deal as in effect giving Northern Ireland as “a delayed gift to the South”.He said it has created “great mistrust”, and fed “the paranoia and siege mentality” among loyalists-unionists.“I know people that would never have been political, wouldn’t have been openly hardline about anything, and they are falling into the fringes,” he said, sitting in a community office in the loyalist Tiger’s Bay area of north Belfast.Loyalists are angered by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s failure to take account of their community’s views or worries during the Brexit process. Gilmour was incensed by Varadkar’s comments in October that people in the North would still be able to post letters in red postboxes after the Brexit deal.Arrogance“Who does he think he is? The arrogance is unbelievable. He is the representative of a foreign state he shouldn’t have any say in the affairs of our state at all.”Although Gilmour is not suggesting violence as a means to oppose the deal, he said he could understand why it is seen as a possibility given that the compromise deal came about in response to the “threat of violence from Irish republicanism” over a potential hard land Border.“It would be foolhardy and naive of the British government to mistake or think that loyalism will be quietly pushed into a corner, and will be pacified and accept the deal as it is,” he said, anticipating “mass protests” from the likes of the Orange Order and other bodies opposed to it.Gilmour says Loyalists are “stuck between a rock and a hard place at the moment”, and that “any deal that dilutes the sovereignty of Northern Ireland will be resisted”.He says he is too young to have experienced the height of the Troubles, but is fearful of a possible return to violence.“I fear the night when you hear the rumble and you know what’s happened. It is that sinking feeling. It is just shared among the loyalist community at the moment there’s a feeling of despair that it is going backwards and we can’t stop it.”He says violence is horrible and wrong, but he warns of a “strange duality” within loyalism.“If it does fall backwards you are going to have to do what you can to protect your people’s birthright. If the state can’t do it, you do it.“That in-built sense, that I know it’s not normal to have, but that lies in the back of your head: what if? What are you prepared to do? And no one should be asking themselves that, but we feel that neglected and pushed.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has claimed comments from Mr Hogan were a “coded partisan intervention” but this was rejected by Mr Hogan and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe. Mr Hogan is a former Fine Gael minister and was first nominated by former taoiseach Enda Kenny to the European Commission. He served a five-year term as agriculture commissioner.He was nominated last year by Mr Kenny’s successor, Leo Varadkar, and has taken up the trade portfolio in the new commission.Earlier this week, ahead of Britain’s formal departure from the EU on Friday, Mr Hogan said he is “very concerned” with what he saw in Ireland regarding Brexit now, urging people to “come out of their slumber” and saying a “crash out” Brexit is still a possibility at the end of the year.A transition period will still see the UK remain in the European single market and customs union, but Mr Hogan said this week: “I’m very concerned at what I see in Ireland the moment. There’s a lot of complacency in the system. Commentators and the media and the public generally don’t seem to realise we’re starting the most difficult part of the negotiations.”Mr Martin told reporters this morning: “I think Phil Hogan now should stay out of domestic Irish politics now for the next week. That was, to me, a coded partisan intervention.”Mr Hogan told RTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke that he had never intervened in domestic politics and Mr Donohoe said Mr Hogan is only “outlining the reality of where our country faces”.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4155648.1580365580!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord varadkar avoids the veronavirus as tds turn out for wexford bridge opening","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Rose Katherine Kennedy Townsend at the opening of the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Bridge in New Ross, co Wexford.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireLeo Varadkar probably thought the biggest threat to a successful day out in Wexford on Wednesday lay outside the Fine Gael camp. The Taoiseach would have been fully aware of the ongoing threat posed by the Veronavirus and his team would have taken all necessary precautions to protect him from it. As it turned out, he never came in contact with Verona Murphy, the party’s much vaunted candidate in the Wexford byelection last year before she ran her mouth off about immigrants and was duly booted off the general election ticket.They don’t like to talk about her now.But the head of the Road Haulage Association hasn’t gone quietly and is running a very strong campaign in the county as an independent. Where once her face adorned posters in Fine Gael blue, she now looks out defiantly from a dark background of burnt orange – or black and tan as the locals are describing it. Apart from her remarks about migrant toddlers in Wexford becoming Islamic State recruits, her posters themselves are an abomination – a grammatical one. However, it was the presence of his own contingent of candidates, lusting after a bit of notice, which posed most risk to Leo – physical rather than political. He stepped from his car in New Ross and before he had time to stand up straight a trio of flying Fine Gael candidates burst from nowhere and hurled themselves at him. But these were no ordinary candidates. These were junior ministerial candidates. There is nothing so ruthless or needy as ambitious junior ministers hell-bent on political advancement. They have tasted a little of power and they crave more. Ministerial velcroPaul Kehoe, Michael D’arcy and John Paul Phelan were the three Fine Gael Ministers of State determined to Velcro themselves to Leo Varadkar during all his photo opportunities at the official opening of the New Ross bypass and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy bridge. Kehoe and D’arcy, on the Wexford side of the magnificent new structure, are fighting it out for the guaranteed Fine Gael seat in the constituency. A second one is looking increasingly like a tall order this time out. Phelan, meanwhile, would be on firmer ground in Carlow-Kilkenny, with colleague Carlow-based Pat Deering snapping at his heels. But every bit of publicity helps. All three were on a mission to milk this good news occasion by getting their mugs in as many photos with photogenic Leo as possible. With perseverance and luck, they might even bag a fleeting appearance on the television news. Alongside them, the Lord Mayor of Wexford, despite being a Fianna Fáil man, shamelessly elbowed himself into the frame whenever he could using his chain of office as a shield. Michael Sheehan is not expected to displace his party colleague and the constituency’s newest TD, Malcolm Byrne, winner of the Wexford bye-election in November, but it won’t be for the want of putting himself about. Byrne decided to stand back from the fray. “It’s a day for the engineers and builders” he said.Pride of Labour PartyAs Leo was engulfed in the rolling maul of his own ministers and one mayor, Labour leader and constituency elder statesman Brendan Howlin swooped in under them all, calmly greeted the Taoiseach and took it upon himself to escort him from his car. Brendan has a proprietorial interest in the new bypass. “I turned the sod on it when I was minister for public expenditure,” he said with pride. Howlin gave the green light to release almost €1 billion in 2012 for significant transport projects, including the New Ross bypass and bridge. And the happy minister for transport also claiming credit at the time was one Leo Varadkar. Graciously, Leo acknowledged his Labour colleague’s part in delivering the infrastructure during his speech. Also claiming credit on large posters in Wexford are the Ministers of State Kehoe and D’arcy: “Shortening your Journey. Delivering for Wexford.” You’d nearly think they built the road themselves. The large platform built on the pristine stretch of roadway with the impressive s of the bridge gleaming in the distance was groaning with public representatives for the formalities. Thankfully, a space was found for engineer (and local woman) Mary Bowe, the project manager.“This is the biggest platform party I’ve seen in a long time at one of these events,” marvelled a public servant. Why could that be? Something to do with the election? TDs from Wexford and Kilkenny took the bare look off the stage. Fianna Fáil’s James Brown and Bobby Aylward didn’t miss the the occasion. There were 21 men on the platform and 3 women (engineer par excellence, Mary Bowe the CEO of Kilkenny County Council and Rose Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, great grand-daughter of the Kennedy matriarch and JFK’s mother, Rose, in whose honour the bridge is named.)Vacant seatsThere were a couple of vacant seats. But Verona Murphy’s name wasn’t on one of them. She was there, at the edge of the crowd, standing near the large foundation stone waiting to be unveiled later by the man who invited her into Fine Gael and then booted her out. (Only herself to blame.)The photographers were hopeful. Windy junior ministers clustered around the Taoiseach aren’t the best material. So they kept an eye on Verona. “Will she approach him, do you think?” one of them asked a colleague. “I hope she f****** does,” came the reply.The speeches went on for a long, long time. There were three chains of office on the platform and more in the invited crowd. The Taoiseach was last to speak. He promised to be brief, recognising it was bitterly cold. At ten minutes, he nearly delivered on the promise. “By the power invested in me, none of you have homework tonight,” he declared, warming the cockles of the 100 hypothermic schoolchildren along to witness this great event. Contractors BAM, the contractors building the National Children’s Hospital, gave them all goodie bags – the children, not the politicians. They contained pens and sweeties. There was an ecumenical prayer service. The Church of Ireland representative cut an imposing figure, a very tall man, dressed for the weather with a voluminous black cape and a black broad brimmed hat. Some people thought he was Phil Hogan. A few Fianna Fáilers were calling the new road the “Howlin Highway”, just to annoy the Fine Gaelers. CountdownAfter the speeches, the Taoiseach went to the other side of the road to unveil the commemorative stone. Verona hovered, but was swallowed up in the crowd. The Taoiseach didn’t see her. Then he went further along the road, with the bridge to his back for the photos, and did the official cutting of the tape with Rose Kennedy Townsend. Leo was wearing very shiny black leather gloves. He held his side of the tape very tightly, wielding a gold pair of scissors and braced, feet apart and firmly planted, like he was preparing to cut the umbilical cord of an alien baby. Or cut all ties with Catherine Noone. He called for a countdown. There was silence. The junior ministers were so excited they couldn’t speak. So he had to do it himself. “5 . . . 4 . . .” Off to one side, Verona Murphy was working the crowd. Earlier, while the Taoiseach made his speech, she stood with her back to him, talking away to a companion. She made sure to avoid him after the formalities, yet was always nearby. He moved, she moved. Always within distance but never close enough for any form of contact. The photographers were beside themselves. But they were to be disappointed. When Leo left, the junior ministers melted away. “I tell you one thing,” mused an official as they departed. “If the Irish team performs half as well in the scrum as that lot performed today, we’ll win hands down against Scotland on Saturday.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4155422.1580333652!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"public transport in meath is broken there is no work life balance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTraffic on the M3 motorway which links Dublin and Navan, Co Meath. File photograph: Alan BetsonPolitical promises come and go but patience when it comes to a long-standing pledge to deliver a train line linking Dublin and Navan, Co Meath, is wearing thin due to residents facing long travel times when commuting by car or bus.Locals say the traffic problem is getting worse as a result of growth in the commuter belt’s population, with buses often full before reaching stops along the route.This has seen the need for a rail line, and a solution to the problem of workers being stuck in cars and on buses for hours every day, emerge as an election issue in the Meath constituencies.“The old catchphrase of Navan being ‘only an hour from Dublin’ certainly doesn’t hold true any more for the commuters, many of whom could be home to their kids in a lot less time in the evenings if there was a train,” says Sinead Walker Nelson (49), who leaves her home in Navan before 5.45am to reach her job at AIB in Ballsbridge on time.Hefty costs“I work remotely two days a week and drive to work the other three as buses would not get me in on time. I leave early to beat the traffic and mornings aren’t too bad, taking about 1½ hours but the evenings are a nightmare.“I’ve tried every route and they are all the same. I leave work and am in the car by 4pm, so technically ahead of rush hour traffic. It still takes me 2½ hours to drive 62km. Regularly it takes me an hour to travel just 12km.”She says the costs are hefty too, with tolls coming to €120 a month and petrol a further €300.To help put these quality of life and infrastructure issues on the agenda ahead of next month’s general election, a public meeting entitled “Meath on Track” is taking place in in the Newgrange Hotel, Navan on Thursday, with Meath West Aontú TD Peadar Tóibín chairing.Rail services ran between Dublin and Navan until the 1960s, when the line was closed as part of a major rationalisation of the State’s railway network.The restoration of the line has been mooted many times since, often around election times, and in 2005 it was announced the line to Navan would be rebuilt in two phases as a branch of the western commuter line.Since September 2010, train services have operated from Dublin’s docklands to the M3 Parkway station near Clonee. An additional 21-mile stretch to Navan was to open by 2015 under the then government’s Transport 21 programme.After the recession hit, plans for the extension were omitted from national infrastructure plans. It was not included in the Government’s Project Ireland 2040 strategy last year and it was reported last summer that Minister for Planning Eoghan Murphy had issued a draft directive to the Eastern and Midlands Regional Authority to downgrade the status of the proposed rail line.Jammed busesEarlier this month, Minister of State and Meath West TD Damien English said the National Transport Authority and Department of Transport were to complete a feasibility study this year on the rail line and that once viability had been proven, the next phase would be the allocation of funding.For people like Andrew Ralph (23), who lives between Dunshaughlin and Ratoath, a rail option cannot come soon enough.He says commuting is the “single biggest issue” in and around Ratoath where he estimates that 70 per cent of people commute to work.“At the minute the biggest problem in Ratoath is that there are no direct buses to Dublin from a village of 11,500 people,” he says.Ralph estimates that he spends an average of 13 hours commuting per week commuting from the town, which is 25km from Dublin city centre.“At the minute, the buses are jammed. The commute is stressful and there is no work-life balance. Public transport in Meath is broken,” he says.In Johnstown, a village outside Navan, commuters report being left on the side of the road regularly by passing buses as they are full to capacity.“When a bus finally stops, there’s a seat lottery. Queues of people push and shove to get on the bus and get a seat,” says Clodagh Roche (45).She says it can take 5½ hours to get to and from college in Blanchardstown and that this means “our quality of life has been diminished”.“We are the people who get up early in the mornings – to try and catch a bus against the odds,” she said.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"WHO holds meeting as Government says to avoid non-essential travel to China\u0026lsquoWhole world needs to be on alert now,\u0026rsquo says WHO as death toll rises to 132 and 6,000 infectedSome 47 people were on White Island when volcano erupted on December 9thHigh-speed rail and cross-border ferry services to be stopped, with flights reducedArdern\u0026rsquos Labour Party-led coalition in power since 2017 will face conservative challengeEmbassy exploring options to evacuate six Irish nationals under lockdown in cityIrish embassy in Beijing monitoring situation but has no plans for an evacuationChinese government steps up efforts to restrict travel and public gatheringsChina temporarily bans sale of wildlife as death toll rises to 56, with nearly 2,000 infectedCity of Wuhan to ban non-essential vehicles from downtown area starting from SundayAuthorities rush to build makeshift hospital as number of suspected cases nears 8,500WHO says it\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquotoo early\u0026rsquo to declare emergency as Scotland reports four suspected casesVerdict aimed at preventing threat of genocide rebuffs Aung San Suu Kyi\u0026rsquos assurancesVictims were American residents air tanker crashed while fighting fires in alpine regionWHO will determine on Thursday if outbreak constitutes a global health emergencyLast year Taiwan became the first Asian country to recognise same-sex marriageControversial new law seen as unconstitutional by opposition, causing months of protestSixth death in China where wider outbreak feared as hundreds of millions begin travelling for lunar new yearHealth commission confirms that coronavirus can spread from person to personCricket ball-sized hail stones smash windows and see residents sledding through streets"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4156320.1580385762!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit day countdown how we got here the complete history","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Leo Varadkar and  Boris Johnson meet at Thornton Manor Hotel, on The Wirral, Cheshire. Photograph: PAAs the United Kingdom prepares to leave the European Union on Friday, here’s a look back at how we got there.January 1st, 1973: The United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark join the European Economic Community (EEC).June 5th, 1975: Unhappy with the terms negotiated by the Conservative government of Edward Heath, the Labour government under Harold Wilson holds a referendum on EEC membership. British voters approve membership of the EEC by 2 to 1.September 20th, 1988: British prime minister Margaret Thatcher makes her famous Bruges speech in which she says Britain will not support closer union between the UK and Europe. She declares: “We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels”. Rows over Britain’s relationship with Europe will dominate the Conservative party for the next three decades.January 23rd, 2013: Under pressure after the success in local and European elections of the UK Independence Party (Ukip), British prime minister David Cameron commits Britain to an in-out referendum on EU membership. He pledges to do so after negotiating a new arrangement with the EU. He promises the referendum if the Conservative Party wins the 2015 British general election. At the time the Conservatives are in coalition with the pro-European Liberal Democrats party which has ruled out such a referendum.May 7th, 2015: Against all the odds, the Conservative party wins a majority in the British general election. Cameron says he will make good on his promise to hold an in-out referendum in the first half of the parliamentary term.February 16-17th, 2016: Cameron gets a deal at the EU summit. The UK is offered an exemption from ever closer union and EU migrants are not allowed to claim benefits for four years after arriving in Britain. However, there was no give from the EU on Cameron’s fundamental demand for an end to freedom of movement to restrict the number of immigrants coming into Britain from the EU. The deal is roundly condemned in the Eurosceptic British press.February 20, 2016: Cameron announces that the referendum will be held on June 23rd, 2016. Reluctantly, he says, he will campaign to remain, but he quickly loses two key cabinet colleagues, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, who announce that they will campaign to leave.June 23rd, 2016: The UK votes to leave the EU by 51.9 per cent to 49.1 per cent. England and Wales votes to leave. Scotland votes strongly to remain (62:38) as does Northern Ireland (55:45). Cameron resigns and Theresa May, a remainer, becomes British prime minister.August 10th, 2016: Then Northern Ireland first minister Arlene Foster of the pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party, and deputy first minister Martin McGuinness of anti-Brexit Sinn Féin, write to May telling her that the Irish Border after Brexit must not become a catalyst for illegal activity or “does not create an incentive for those who wish to undermine the peace process andor the political settlement”.January 17th, 2017: In a speech at Lancaster House in London, May sets out her government’s plan for a hard Brexit and draws the UK’s red lines for a deal with the EU. She insists that the country plans to leave the EU single market and the customs union and promises to negotiate the freest possible trade” with EU counties after Brexit. She argues that “no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain”.March 29th, 2017: May formally triggers Article 50 for the UK to leave the European Union. Two years hence, March 29th, 2019, is set as the date for the UK’s departure.June 8th, 2017: May calls a snap British general election to achieve a renewed mandate for her Brexit negotiations, but it turns out to be a disaster for the Conservative party. A resurgent Labour deprives her of a majority and she becomes dependent on the Democratic Unionist Party for support. The Tories and DUP enter into a confidence and supply arrangement at Westminster.June 19th, 2017: Formal Brexit negotiations begin between the EU and the UK.September 22nd, 2017: In a speech in Florence, May says she would like a transition period or “implementation period” of two years after the UK leaves the EU when all rules will remain the same. She rules out a future trading relationship with the EU where the UK would be in a member of the European Economic Area like Norway saying it would be too restrictive or an EU deal with Canada, which would take too long to negotiate.December 8th, 2017: The EU and the UK negotiating teams agree a protocol on Northern Ireland. It states there will be “specific solutions to address the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland” to avoid a hard border. They envisage full regulatory alignment with EU customs union and single market rules to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The backstop is born and will enter the lexicon for the next two years.March 1st, 2018: Theresa May declares that the UK will be leaving both the single market and the customs union. She also states the UK will no longer come under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Her so-called Mansion House speech declares that there will be no hard border in Ireland. “But it is not good enough to say, ‘We won’t introduce a hard border if the EU forces Ireland to do it, that’s down to them’. We chose to leave we have a responsibility to help find a solution.” The UK will find no technological solutions to a hard border.March 19th, 2018: The EU and UK agrees a withdrawal deal including the “backstop” for Northern Ireland that would effectively keep the North in the customs union and the various parts of the single market to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland if no other solutions were found in a future trade deal. The two sides agree a transition period from the March 29th, 2019 to December 31st, 2020.April 26th, 2018: The DUP warns Theresa May that it will bring down her government if Northern Ireland is forced to stay in the EU customs union or single market after Brexit.July 6th, 2018: May develops her Brexit plan with cabinet ministers at the prime minister’s country residence at Chequers, planning to maintain “common rulebook for all goods” with the EU after Brexit and a combined customs territory and free trade area between the EU and the UK.July 8th \u0026amp 9th, 2018: May’s Brexit secretary David Davis resigns over her soft Brexit proposals set out in the Chequers plan saying that it was “giving away too much and too easily” to the EU in the negotiations. Dominic Raab takes over as Brexit secretary. Boris Johnson resigns as foreign secretary claiming that the UK was heading “for the status of a colony” under May’s Chequers plan.September 2nd, 2018: The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier rejects the Chequers plan saying that May’s idea for a “facilitated customs arrangement” to collect and pass on tariffs to Brussels on EU-bound goods passing through the UK would illegally relinquish control of the EU’s external borders and revenue. He argued that the common rulebook on goods would kill the European project.November 14th, 2018: The EU and the UK conclude a draft withdrawal agreement which will see the UK remain within the customs union, but Northern Ireland would also remain within the single market until a comprehensive trade agreement is concluded. This is designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland, but there are huge objections both from the DUP and from Tory Eurosceptic MPs who fear that the arrangements will bind the UK to the EU indefinitely. DUP MPs reject it on the basis that it will separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.November 25th, 2018: London and Brussels agree a new withdrawal agreement that extends the scale of the backstop to keep the whole of the UK, and not just Northern Ireland, closely aligning the UK with EU customs rules with some regulatory differences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK that would mean some checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea to the North. The DUP and Tory Brexiteers reject the plan.December 12th, 2018: May survives an attempt by Tory MPs to remove her in a vote of no confidence. She survives by a vote of 200 to 117 in a secret ballot.January 15th, 2019: The first “meaningful” vote on Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement is emphatically rejected. The 432 to 202 vote is the largest defeat for any British government in more than a century.February 6th, 2019: European Council president Donald Tusk says there will be “a special place in hell” for politicians who promoted Brexit without any plan for how to deliver it.March 12th, 2019: The withdrawal agreement is defeated for a second time time by 391 votes to 242.March 14th, 2019: With no hope of breaking the deadlock in parliament, MPs vote for a Brexit extension from March 31st to October 31st.March 29th, 2019: The withdrawal agreement is rejected a third time by 344 vores to 286.April 5th, 2019: May writes to Tusk seeking an extension of the Article 50 Brexit process to June 30th.April 10th, 2019: EU leaders agree to extend Brexit until October 31st, 2019, but offers a “flex-tension” where the UK can leave by the end of June if the House of Commons approves the withdrawal agreement.

Photograph: Yves HermanEPAAt 11pm on Friday, January 31st, after 47 years in the European Economic Community and European Union, the United Kingdom is formally leaving the bloc, some 1,317 days after the Brexit referendum. It is the first time in the history of the European economic and political bloc that it has lost a member.What will change on February 1st?In practice, everyday life will look like it was on January 31st. A business-as-usual standstill agreement, known as the transition period, means that until December 31st, 2020, the UK will continue to be bound by EU laws but will no longer have a say in how those laws are formed because Brexit means that it must leave the EU’s political institutions, bodies and agencies. The UK’s 73 MEPs have lost their jobs, freeing up two additional seats in the European Parliament for Ireland. These will be taken up by the two “cold storage” MEPs Fianna Fáil’s Barry Andrews and Fine Gael’s Deirdre Clune who were elected last year but did not take up their seats pending the UK’s exit.During the 11-month Brexit purgatory period, the European Commission will monitor the UK’s compliance with its laws and the European Court of Justice will retain the power to make rulings and fines against the UK if breaches of EU rules and laws are identified.What does it mean for the people?British subjects will no longer be EU citizens but they will continue to enjoy free movement across the EU for the transition period. From January 1st, 2021, British people living in the remaining 27 EU member states will have their rights to live in those countries protected under the Brexit agreement. The three million EU citizens living in the UK have until June 2021 to apply for “settled status” allowing them to stay and enjoy existing rights after Brexit. Irish citizens in the UK may apply for “settled status” but do not have to because they enjoy a right of residence in the UK through the separate Common Travel Area agreement between Ireland and the UK. This long-standing relationship is not reliant on the UK’s membership of the EU.What will happen to Northern Ireland during the transition period?Nothing. The “protocol” for Ireland and Northern Ireland will not be activated as the UK will remain in the EU customs union and single market for the 11-month period. The Brexit deal’s so called “front stop” compromise - an Irish Sea trade border chosen to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic - will only come into effect on January 1st, 2021.Can the transition period be extended?Yes. The Brexit deal allows the UK and EU to decide by July 1st to extend the Brexit limbo by up to two years, but UK prime minster Boris Johnson has legally blocked himself requesting an extension under legislation passed to implement the withdrawal agreement. Legislation could be amended to bypass this ban, though it would be seen as a political climbdown by Johnson.So is that the end of EU-UK negotiations?Eh, no way. Exiting was only the first part of the orce. The second involves the EU and the UK reaching an agreement on how they will work and trade with each other in the future and this is regarded as the most difficult part. The aim of the negotiations is to agree a deal that will come into force by the end of the transition period.Will that be enough time?It will be extremely difficult given the depth and range of the issues and areas to be discussed. Boris Johnson says a deal is possible by the end of the year the EU thinks otherwise. The EU’s chief trade negotiator Phil Hogan, Ireland’s commissioner, has said there will be only “four or five” negotiating rounds before July when the UK must decide whether to extend the transition period.What will those negotiations touch on?In addition to trade issues around services, fisheries, agriculture and state aid, the talks will also cover security and intelligence co-operation, data sharing, energy and transport links, research collaboration and the UK’s participation in EU science, space and education programmes.When will the negotiations begin?The European Commission will publish its draft negotiating mandate on February 3rd that must be approved by EU leaders at a summit on February 25th. Talks should begin in early March.How difficult could these negotiations be?Potentially extremely difficult. The more the UK decides to erge from the rules and standards of the EU single market, the more difficult it will be to agree a free trade agreement. One British government minister has said the UK will not align itself with EU rules after Brexit. If there is no trade deal agreed by December 31st, 2020, then the following day a “hard Brexit” will kick in: World Trade Organisation rules with hefty tariffs will automatically apply on each other’s goods.What will the early flash-point issues be?The biggest sticking points, initially at least, are likely to be on access to fishing waters and the EU’s demand for a “level playing field” where there would be no advantage between the EU and UK in competition and business subsidies, social and environmental protections, and tax.So could there still be a disorderly, cliff-edge Brexit at the end of this year?Yes, if the EU and UK cannot agree on a future trading relationship.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

My mission to make our house more sustainable starts with thinking about making it warmer this week, I’ve been mostly thinking about thermostats.Given my day job is technology editor here at The Independent, it’s the technological solutions that seem most immediate. And starting with the thermostat seems an obvious one, given how much money and emissions are wasted on central heating.We recently got a smart thermostat, after struggling with a decidedly un-smart timer on our boiler. There was of course nothing green about that, given that it spent much of the time coming on when we weren’t even in. And there was plenty that wasn’t comfortable about it, either, since it would often be on when the house was too hot, or not in as we shivered in the cold. (In the end we gave up and mostly turned it off and on manually.)Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe have the Nest Thermostat E. (Nest, which is now owned by Google, are probably the most famous of the smart home companies, and the thermostat is probably their most famous product the E supposedly stands for a variety of things including “easy” and “energy-saving”, but basically means that it’s the cheaper version.) It works by getting your location and learning how you tend to like your heating, setting up a smart schedule and turning the heating off when you’re not there.So since the beginning of the year I’ve been thinking about how best we can optimise the amount of energy that thermostat uses. Though it is smart, it still works on what you tell it as such, you can change what sort of temperature you want it to be.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

So the main thing I’ve done is turn the heating down before we get into bed, ensuring that we aren’t wasting heat that will only be around once we’ve gone to bed. (Another of my personal pledges for 2020 is to ensure that I pay full attention to my sleep, after reading Matthew Walker’s luminous book on the subject, and this helps with that too.)Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThe Nest gives you a leaf when you’re being energy-\u0026nbspand eco-conscious by having the temperature lower than it might expect. And I feel generally rewarded, too: while there’s no real way to know the impact this is having on our own gas usage, it feels like we almost certainly are saving energy.Smart thermostats – or, if you are like me and didn’t have a non-smart one before, any kind of thermostat – feel like a wonderful symbol of how easy it can be to be more efficient. As it turns out, we aren’t much colder our house is still heated when we need it. It’s just that it won’t be heated when we’re not there, or when we’re already warm enough. Saving money and emissions on heating has actually made life easier.Getting one is expensive, of course: the Nest Thermostat E is £199, and you’ll have to pay for installation if you live in a confusing, complicated house like ours. But most people probably won’t need to, and there are plenty of deals and discount schemes from energy companies that should make it a little more easy to swallow.I suspect, as we head through the year of making our house more sustainable, that not all the changes we make will be quite so seamless, comfortable or sacrifice free. But I certainly hope so, because this feels like the kind of change that is incredibly nice to make, not only helping save the world in the tiniest way, but also saving money, and saving us from being cold.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Factories outside Wuhan area will not reopen after the lunar new year holiday until 10 February, Mr Cook said, but Apple built the delayed restart into its wider revenue forecast.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Those currently paying a lot in daily fees are likely to see their borrowing costs reduced while those who are less heavily into their overdrafts will pay more.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Torches are lit using a flare ahead of the Up Helly Aa Viking festival.

It has previously warned that it would look at introducing a cap on overdraft charges if lenders did not introduce competitive rates.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB will all introduce rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Lloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent from April.In a letter to lenders, the FCA wrote: “We are writing to you to understand more about your new overdraft pricing and the measures you have in place to help customers who may be adversely impacted by the changes you are making to this pricing.”The watchdog introduced changes to overdraft rules after it found that unarranged overdraft fees can be 10 times as high as charges for payday loans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes.

(EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Greer has since defended her decision to meet with Fox, tweeting: “I like people who are different from me. Since I was a little kid. I still do. Why I moved ‘abroad’. So sad to see so many people in their little bunkers, in their teeny little helmets, sniping at the world outside. I’m surprised that there are so many of them...”In another tweet, she wrote: “I talk to and take pictures with whomever I like. Always have. Always will. Tra-la-la, #haters.”Greer also commented several time on Fox’s “incredible” and “amazing” shoes, which she said she was “fixated by”.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Factories outside Wuhan area will not reopen after the lunar new year holiday until 10 February, Mr Cook said, but Apple built the delayed restart into its wider revenue forecast.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Those currently paying a lot in daily fees are likely to see their borrowing costs reduced while those who are less heavily into their overdrafts will pay more.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Torches are lit using a flare ahead of the Up Helly Aa Viking festival.

Britain will go to the polls tomorrow to voteA surfer off the North East coast at TynemouthThe FCA said on Tuesday that it has asked banks how they decided on their new rates, which have clustered around 40 per cent. It has previously warned that it would look at introducing a cap on overdraft charges if lenders did not introduce competitive rates.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB will all introduce rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Lloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent from April.In a letter to lenders, the FCA wrote: “We are writing to you to understand more about your new overdraft pricing and the measures you have in place to help customers who may be adversely impacted by the changes you are making to this pricing.”The watchdog introduced changes to overdraft rules after it found that unarranged overdraft fees can be 10 times as high as charges for payday loans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When they arrive at the Earth\u0027s ionosphere, they excite the oxygen and nitrogen atoms found in the upper atmosphere, and that energy is released as lights.Created with Sketch.Northern Lights across the UK - in pictures Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The beautiful colours of light shining through the Sycamore Gap at Hadrian\u0027s Wall in NorthumberlandThe sky surrounding St Mary\u0027s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, NorthumberlandThis shot was taken in NorthumberlandThe beautiful skies could be spotted across the sea in Giant\u0027s Causeway, Northern IrelandThe lights seen over Great Park in NewcastleA beach in Saltburn, North YorkshireThe beautiful colours of light shining through the Sycamore Gap at Hadrian\u0027s Wall in NorthumberlandThe sky surrounding St Mary\u0027s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, NorthumberlandThis shot was taken in NorthumberlandThe beautiful skies could be spotted across the sea in Giant\u0027s Causeway, Northern IrelandThe lights seen over Great Park in NewcastleA beach in Saltburn, North YorkshireWhile the northern lights are often seen as one phenomenon, they are something like clouds: there are a whole host of different kinds, each of which are formed in their own particular ways.The new discovery began when the University of Helsinki\u0027s\u0026nbspMinna Palmroth looked to collect these different kinds of northern lights, in collaboration with enthusiasts. Those hobbyists took photographs of thousands of different examples of the northern lights, which she picked through and categorised for a book to guide those watching the\u0026nbspaurora borealis.A complete guide to the Northern LightsBut as the hobbyists collected those images through Facebook, they found that many of them included a kind of auroral form that was not part of the existing classification. Those were set aside to be examined later, and the book was published.Just days after it came out, enthusiasts spotted the mysterious form again: they saw a green-tinged, even set of waves that looked similar to dunes on a sandy beach. They told Professor Palmroth, who was able to get to work looking into it.One of the most memorable moments of our research collaboration was when the phenomenon appeared at that specific time and we were able to examine it in real time, says Northern Lights and astronomy hobbyist\u0026nbspMatti\u0026nbspHelin\u0026nbspin a statement.The hobbyists and space researchers worked together to collate photos from across Finland. Combining the images – and looking for clues such as stars in the background – allowed the scientists to discover where exactly the lights were coming from.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Their waveform stretched 45 kilometres across.That height put them in a particularly neglected part of the sky: it is where the Earth\u0027s atmosphere collides with the edge of space, and is difficult for satellites to see.Due to the difficulties in measuring the atmospheric phenomena occurring between 80 and 120 kilometres in altitude, we sometimes call this area \u0027the\u0026nbspignorosphere\u0027, she said in a statement.The phenomenon appears to happen because of the bore phenomenon. Scientists say that gravity waves are born in the atmosphere and then rise up – but when they hit a particular layer, they can be bent and stretch out for long distances.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

His partner, Jade Samuel, is currently on maternity leave and is due to return to work in two weeks, but won’t be able to if he\u0026nbsphas left the country, which he said would leave her “struggling to cope”.Mr\u0026nbspNembhard, who has been fighting his immigration case for years, said: “I’m really depressed. I cry when I think about my child. It’s really sensitive because I’m the world to her, and she’s the same to me. We have a really close bond and this is all starting to affect her.“My partner will struggle to cope. I don’t know what I’ll do if I have to leave my kids. The Home Office is destroying their lives.”The Jamaica charter flight is an outrage – but so are many othersDozens to be deported on first Jamaica charter flight since WindrushThe Jamaican national arrived to the UK on a visit visa in\u0026nbsp1999. He met his ex-wife and applied to remain in the country with her but his application was refused.He continued to fight the case but was accused of assault by his ex-wife\u0026nbsp– whom he had by this point separated from and got together with Ms Samuel – an allegation he still denies.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe courts found him guilty and he was sentenced to prison shortly after his daughter was born. He was then immediately detained under immigration powers, before being released on bail and settling down in\u0026nbspLondon with Ms Samuel\u0026nbspand their daughter.In February 2019, he was one of several Jamaicans\u0026nbspthreatened with deportation despite being key witnesses in the inquest into the death of an immigration detainee – but he was granted last-minute reprieve after solicitors intervened.Without immigration status, Mr Nembhard has been unable to work, but Ms Samuel, who works as a supervisor at a jewellery wholesalers, said the family “makes it work” as he is able to care for the children while she works.“He’s an amazing dad. He is their primary carer. I want to be able to work and continue providing for my family. If he is deported I’ll become a single mum, I’d have to rely on benefits. I’ve never had to do that. It took me a long time to get to this position at work but this means I will have to stop working,” she said.“When he was detained on Monday, I did the school run instead of him. My daughter asked, ‘Where’s dad? Has he gone to that place again?’ She’s been emotional. I’ve had to let her school know. She keeps asking when he’s coming home. They’re really close.Dozens to be deported on first Jamaica charter flight since Windrush“The immigration situation has really shaken us up over the past few years. Every time we get a bit of stability, they seem to take him away again. He deserves to be with his family. Here is where his life is.”Mr Nembhard was detained despite the fact that he had a “further submissions” appointment with the Home Office in March where his immigration case was going to be reconsidered.David\u0026nbspLammy, the family’s local MP, condemned the Home Office for putting them in this situation, saying the lives of Mr\u0026nbspNembhard’s\u0026nbspBritish wife and children were being “devastated” by the department’s “gross mishandling” of the case.The Labour MP said more broadly\u0026nbspthat it was wrong for the Home Office to be chartering deportation flights to Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean before the delayed\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspreview has been published, adding: “How can the home secretary be sure she is not making the same mistakes?”Naga Kandiah, of MTC Solicitors, who is representing Mr Nembhard, said his detention was making it difficult to effectively prepare for his Home Office interview in March, and accused the Home Office of acting in a “harsh and heartless” manner towards\u0026nbspBritish children and their parents.“Without notification, Mr Nembhard was detained. Due to the complexity of his case, we need to obtain all of his past papers from previous solicitors, coroner’s inquest papers, instruct medical and social worker reports, but we cannot do this as effectively as he is incarcerated,” he said.“His family are suffering due to the absence of Mr Nembhard at home. His British wife and British children are not only deeply worried by him being incarcerated with no certainty, but also, struggling to cope as a family unit in day to day activities.”The Home Office confirmed that it would be operating a charter flight to Jamaica in the coming weeks and said those being deported had all been convicted of crimes in the UK.A spokesperson added: “Foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK\u0026nbspshould be in no doubt of our determination to deport them.

It seemed like there\u0027s a disconnect.When he approached the candidate at a small campaign event at Urban Dreams in Des Moines, Mr Fallon says he was expecting Mr Biden to address the concerns I was raising about climate change.Instead, he says, he was surprised that Mr Biden appeared to deflect his support, should Mr Biden be selected as the Democratic nominee in the general election, during which he ostensibly would want to earn Mr Fallon\u0027s vote.He just made it more difficult, Mr Fallon says.Mr Biden has pushed back against several would-be voters throughout his campaign, including telling an immigration activist in South Carolina to vote for Trump and telling another man in Iowa — who the candidate also called a damn liar —\u0026nbspthat he\u0027s too old to vote for him.On his website, Mr Fallon writes that his most recent exchange is disturbing on a number of levels.He said: His propensity to violate personal space is a huge non-asset in politics, and his frequent gaffes are prime fodder for opponents and the media. ... Most important, Biden is simply wrong on climate change, and out-of-step with voters on so many issues.Mr Fallon says he supports Mr Steyer for his track record of environmental advocacy and promise to declare a climate emergency on the first day of his administration, if elected.On Twitter, Mr Steyer addressed Mr Biden, telling him: This is no way to treat an Iowan. He said he\u0027d vote for the Dem in the general bc he knows how important it is to beat Trump. We need immediate action on climate. If you don\u0027t agree, happy to talk @ debate.

Some  to  per cent of cases are severe, meaning people require hospital treatment or ventilation as the disease causes a pneumonia-like illness.While the SARS-like virus, known as -nCoV, is fast becoming an international cause for concern, it is still a far cry from the virus pandemics in the past, which have ravaged entire countries and claimed millions of lives.Here we take a closer look at the worst ever pandemic viruses to date.It was a case of pass the plague in  A.D. when an early case of smallpox broke out.Known as the Antonine plague, it began with the Huns who then infected the Germans, who passed it onto the Romans whose troops spread it throughout the Roman Empire.Galen, a Greek physician, witnessed the outbreak and recorded the symptoms: blackish diarrhoea, which suggested gastrointestinal bleeding, intensive coughing, foul-smelling breath and red and black skin eruptions all over their body.The total deaths have been estimated at five million, and the disease killed as much as one-third of the population in some areas and devastated the Roman army.This plague continued until about  A.D, claiming Emperor Marcus Aurelius as one of its victims.From  to  an outbreak of the Black Death ravaged Europe, Africa and Asia, with an estimated death toll between  and million people.Thought to have originated in Asia, the Plague most likely jumped continents via fleas living on rats that lived aboard merchant ships.It took ten to fourteen days before the plague killed off most of a contaminated rat colony, by which time, after three days of fasting, hungry rat fleas would then turn on humans, their bite causing a swelling – or “bubo” — most often in the groin, on the thigh, in an armpit or on the neck.Hence the name bubonic plague.The infection took three to five days to incubate in people before they fell ill, and another three to five days before, in  per cent of the cases, the victims died.The Black Death began in London in the poor, overcrowded parish of St. Giles-in-the-Field and ended up wiping out  percent of the population during that terrible summer.When it hit a household, the house was sealed, a red cross painted on the door and the whole family was condemned to death.Dead bodies became so prevalent that many remained rotting on the ground and it created a constant stench.The Spanish flu pandemic, often regarded as one of the deadliest in history, killed an estimated million people of the million it infected as it tore through Europe in  and travelled to the US, killing , Americans.By comparison, the First World War, which ended in , had around million deaths.The first wave of the  pandemic occurred in the spring and was generally mild with the sick experiencing typical flu symptoms such as chills, fever and fatigue then recovering after several days.However, a second, highly contagious wave appeared with a vengeance in autumn of that same year and victims died within hours or days of developing symptoms, their skin turning blue and their lungs filling with fluid that caused them to suffocate.At the time, there were no effective drugs or vaccines to treat it. Citizens were ordered to wear masks, schools, theatres and businesses were shuttered and bodies piled up in makesht morgues with many having to dig graves for their own family members.It became known around the world as the Spanish flu, as Spain was hit hard by the disease and not subject to the wartime news blackouts that affected other European countries.What separated the  flu pandemic from other influenza outbreaks was the victims — instead of killing young people and the elderly, it struck down completely healthy young adults, while leaving children and those with weaker immune systems still alive.By the summer of , the flu pandemic came to an end, as those that were infected either died or developed immunity.Asian Flu was a pandemic outbreak of Influenza A of the HN subtype that originated in China in  and lasted until .In the first few months, it spread throughout China and its regions but by the midsummer it had reached the United States, where it initially infected relatively few people.Several months later, however, numerous cases of infection were reported, especially in young children, the elderly, and pregnant women.The pandemic also reached the UK and by December a total of , deaths had been reported in England and Wales.Estimates for the death toll y depending on the source, but the World Health Organization places the final tally at approximately million, , of those in the US alone.The Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus transmitted primarily by the aggressive blood-sucking Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and symptoms included fever, rash, joint pain and red eyes.In May , the first local transmission of Zika virus was reported in Brazil and researchers believed the virus was introduced during the August  World Sprint Championship canoe race, held in Rio de Janeiro, which attracted participants from four Pacic Island nations, including French Polynesia, with active Zika transmission.The virus soon spread and affected more than .million people in  countries, thanks to the mosquito’s ability to thrive in city le, flourishing in litter, open ditches, clogged drains, old tyre dumps and crowded flimsy dwellings.The virus was also linked to thousands of babies in Brazil being born with microcephaly, a neurological disorder where the baby had an underdeveloped brain and an abnormally small head.There were also a rising number of stillbirths and miscarriages in mothers infected with the virus.The children that did survive faced intellectual disability and developmental delays.From the first reported case on July ,  in Hong Kong, it took only  days before outbreaks of this virus — referred to as the Hong Kong Flu — were reported in Singapore and Vietnam, and within three months had spread to The Philippines, India, Australia, Europe, and the United States.While the  pandemic had a comparatively low mortality rate, it still resulted in the deaths of more than a million people, including , residents of Hong Kong itself, approximately  per cent of its population at the time.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The police denied her a lawyer. The Mayor of Ayia Napa threatened to sue her unless she withdrew the rape allegations. And the judge conducting her trial refused to hear crucial evidence.Now, her harrowing diaries reveal just how much she suffered at their hands.If the British Government is to prevent others going through a similar ordeal, it must act without delay.First, the Prime Minister must throw his full weight behind her brave appeal to clear her name.If that doesn’t work, the Foreign Office should make no bones about advising Brits not to travel to Cyprus.Why  Because the island clearly needs a kick up the backside to reform its broken legal system. And a financially devastating exodus of British tourists would provide exactly that.We don’t believe it’s at all likely that a woman would consent to sex with a dozen strangers.

If British businesses won’t invest to train British workers, then who on earth do they think willWhich is why we’re delighted that the Government is stepping in.Under our new, improved post-Brexit immigration system, foreign workers prepared to plug jobs that don’t interest British nationals will be prioritised.And those looking to undercut our eager workers will be sent packing.Big companies that have grown used to taking shortcuts are in for a shock.But the lives of ordinary working Brits will be improved immeasurably.HAS there ever been a politician as pig-headed as Jeremy Corbyn Having led his party to its worst defeat in living memory, he plans to launch an organisation named after himself.He evidently has delusions he’ll be remembered for defeating imperialism.But his true legacy is a party on its knees, a red wall gone blue and a bunch of hard-working MPs out of jobs.If he had any sense or self-respect, he would slip quietly back into obscurity. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It began in the far eastback in  and since then, has spread to Italy, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa and Vietnam, where it’s presented by Hoang Rapper. Seriously.Five weeks ago the global pandemic reached Britain and those millions of us who were infected have spent an uncomfortable month trying to work outThe Masked Singer is so bad it’s good or merely so bad it’s an affront to humanity.Somewhat reluctantly, I’ve finally got to admit it’s the former, despite having more than enough self-inflicted wounds and production flaws to sink most programmes.The Masked Singer is, for starters, no sort of contest, and while some of the singers, like Chameleon Justin Hawkins, disguise their identity brilliantly, John Barrowman could no more hide his showbiz light under the Large Hadron Collider than he could a unicorn outfit.There are also issues with that hopelessly random , Jonathan, Rita, Davina McCall and Donny Osmond Ken Jeong, who are either deliberately muddying the waters or are actually thick and deluded enough to believe a Joel Dommett-fronted show might also feature “Margot Robbie”, “Ray Winstone”, “Gemma Arterton”, “Helen Mirren” and “Olivia Colman”, in fancy dress outfits.God knows, it must be hard for them to confront the idea The Masked Singer is now the biggest thing in their careers. The only people I actually feel sorry for, though, are the poor dancers who’ve suffered the torments of hell on this show.The absolute worst of which was doing the twist, wearing only towels and snorkels, while that trippy octopus thing sang Splish Splash standing up in a bath. Yet still I watch. Why  Well, I’ve no realistic choice when the alternative is as tedious as BBC’s The Greatest Dancer.But I’d also choose The Masked Singer over X Factor, The Voice UK and practically any other Saturday night alternative the two main channels have served up recently, for the simple reason the basic guessing game concept and the end-of-show reveal are infuriatingly brilliant.Indeed, I’d go so far as to say Tutankhamun removing his head to reveal former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is one of the TV highlights of the year so far. Inevitably, the overlong shows, repetitive nature of the process and relative disappointments, like discovering it was Kelis in the daisy outfit, will quickly cure me.I’m sticking with The Masked Singer for now, though, because a slightly better bet than Natalie Cole has just reared its head in the duck outfit. After several weeks insisting it was a Spice Girl, Jonathan Ross now thinks: “It could be Diane Abbott . . . ”And, you never know, she might even do her own version of a Spice Girls song,  Become . I’ve rarely wanted anything more.BEST TV hour of the past week was Channel ’s SAS: Who Dares Wins, despite the fact its contestants were only visible for about  per cent of ­Sunday night’s show.Rest of the time they were blotted out by a gigantic Atlantic p***-storm which had engulfed the beautul and brutal island of Raasay, on Scotland’s west coast, so that all you could actually see were some green blobs lumbering up and down the mountains and all you could hear was swearing, from Ant Middleton.Or Foxy. Or possibly Billy. Or maybe even Ollie. “Put the casualty on the f***ing stretcher. Grab the f***ing stretcher and f***ing get him off the f***ing hill. That’s how we f***ing do it. Now move.”A big ask, I think you’ll agree, and the only one who seemed equal to it was James, an estate agent, who’s cracked every single challenge but not a single smile since episode one.He has, however, hinted at a very dark backgroundand claimed, with an entirely straight face: “It’s dficult to sayI’m good at hiding my emotions, ’cos I don’t have many.”No sooner had he said it, though, than Ant and the boys were pressing play on a Skype message from his mum. “Hi Peanut!” At which point James turned into a blubbing, schoolboy wreck.THE burning issue and question on Channel ’s mind last night was Bring Back The Bush: Where Did Our Pubic Hair Go  Where indeed  If it isn’t exactly where you left it or down the back of the sofa.Who worse to investigate this pressing issue, then, than Chidera Eggerue, the creative force behind the “Saggy Boobs Matter” campaign, who clearly craves attention and victim status but hasn’t worked out any better way of getting them than by making a gigantic exhibition of herself.So she’d set herself a real “challenge” here. “I’m growing my pubic hair for the next six weeks.” Exactly the sort of zero-effort empty gesture millennials seem to love.Chidera wasn’t quite confident enough in the project to go it alone, though, so she’d roped in four other minge martyrs to sprout away, while she went to LA to gawp at a porn shoot and work out why it was all the fault of men and the media.With the help of some anecdotal cobblers and an old copy of Playboy, Chidera eventually established the “flawless, hairless women” era was all about blokes “policing women’s bodies”, and the only way to fight back was, as I’d feared: “By revealing our bushes to the world.”When push came to shave, though, two of her mates insisted on wearing massive pants for the climactic photoshoot, the smartest one opted out completely and Chidera herself unveiled something that could’ve been her chuff, but could just as easily have been Ben Kingsley in All Hail The King. Bring Back The Bush  Bring back National Service first, please.But I honestly don’t think they’d get it even then.THIS week’s winner is Susanna Reid and Penny Proud from the Proud Family cartoons.Emailed in by Ricky J.

At times since the decisive referendum vote in , it looked asBrexit would remain a distant fantasy, thanks to the determination of much of the pro-EU establishment to overturn the result.But in the end, the will of the public has prevailed over federalist ideology. The dream of national freedom is about to become a reality.This change in status will represent a daunting challenge for Britain. No longer a regional province in the EU’s empire, we will take charge of our own destiny, with control over our economy, borders, laws, trade and justice system.With self-governance comes tremendous responsibility - and doubts and concerns about trade deals. But our nation can rise to the test.Indeed, Brexit could be the cue for the renewal of our institutions and the rebirth of our democracy.After all, we have achieved so much in the past as an independent nation, pioneering Parliamentary rule, leading the Industrial Revolution, and defeating tyranny in two World Wars.Given this heritage, there is no reason why Britain cannot embrace a new era of greatness.Yet that is not how the embittered Remainers see our future. Immersed in their worship of Brussels, obsessed with goal of European integration at the expense of nationhood, they continually preach the gospel of defeatism and despair.According to their gloomy propaganda, Brexit is a disastrous mistake, which will leave Britain hopelessly in decline.In their view, our country cannot survive on its own. The cold winds of isolation will be felt outside the warm embrace of the EU federation.This is the message that the pro-EU brigade has been peddling for years, ever since the referendum was first proposed.During the  campaign, the Government embarked on its notorious Project Fear, full of grim warnings about the dire consequences of abandoning our EU membership.One Treasury paper predicted that a vote for Leave would “represent an immediate and profound shock to the economy,” followed by a massive rise in unemployment and a meltdown in sterling.But these dire forecasts have not been realised. Instead, since , the British economy has proved to be remarkably robust.There has been no recession, no collapse in the property market, no explosion in the dole queues. On the contrary, the British jobs miracle has continued to accelerate.Only last week, official figures revealed that unemployment is down to its lowest level since , while the national workforce is at its largest in history.Particularly striking is the rise in self-employment to over five million, which indicates that the culture of enterprise is flourishing.Investors have not been deterred by Brexit.According to the Financial Times, “UK equities are positioned to outperform their peers in Europe and the USA.Manufacturing is also poised to prosper. Last week a survey by the Confederation of British Industry highlighted the biggest surge in confidence within this sector on record.Commenting on the “bullish” economic mood in Britain, the distinguished German journalist Alexander Von Schoenburg, editor-at-large of the bestselling BILD newspaper, wrote last weekend: “I see a nation with a strong sense of purpose, built on trust in its own capabilities and a powerful economy.I see a vibrant, open place that can attract huge amounts of foreign investment, has an unrivalled record in business start-ups and is a global pioneer in scientic and genetic research.”Von Schoenburg is right. Our independent future can be a golden one. Already the International Monetary Fund, which in  warned of recession, now predicts that over the next two years, economic growth will be twice as fast in the UK as in any other G state in Europe.What the pessimists ignore are the huge advantages held by Britain, like the global dominance of the English language, the cultural reach of our arts, music and entertainment industries, the strength of our financial services and the solidity of our political system - which was recently demonstrated again in the defeat of Jeremy Corbyn’s quasi-revolutionary Labour party.A recent poll of , chief executives, carried out by the consultancy firm PwC, found that the UK is increasingly attractive to global businesses looking for growth and investment opportunities.Commenting on the survey, PwC’s chairman Kevin Ellis said that “viewed against the turbulent global backdrop, the UK is a beacon of relative stability.”Indeed, on the eve of Brexit, the real crisis is faced, not by Britain, but by the EU and its member states.Whereas Britain can show its dynamism by the embrace of global competition and commerce, Europe is still trapped in outdated economic structures, characterised by heavy regulation, state intervention and unaffordable welfare.Almost every European nation is now in trouble, dragged down by sluggish growth and political dislocation.While Germany hovers on the brink of recession, France is in turmoil because of ferocious opposition to attempts by President Macron’s Government to reform its vast public sector and expensive pension schemes.Spain is now in the grip of socialism, Italy in economic sclerosis. Ireland’s current General Election is unlikely to give any one party more than  per cent of the vote, a recipe for more fragility.For the EU itself, Brexit represents a threat to its very existence.That is not just because of the loss of Britain’s budget contributions, signicant though they are.It is more becauseBritain prospers outside the EU, then the justication for Brussels rule would be permanently demolished.All the claims about the necessity of political integration would be exposed as delusions. That is why pro-EU campaigners so dread the possibility of a booming Britain on the continent’s doorstep.Our success would be the EU’s nightmare.There is, of course, no guarantee that Britain will flourish.There could be dficult times ahead, prompted by a global recession or the refusal of the USA to reach a trade deal because of security objections to the involvement of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei in our broadband network.Equally, the EU might prove tough in its own negotiations with us about a trade agreement. Already this week the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has warned that the EU has “the upper hand” and the “stronger team”.But the cause of British independence has triumphed over serious obstacles in the recent past.With determination and vision, our country can do so again, emboldened by the taste of freedom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The figures lay bare that the five-week policy simply isn’t working - it just drives people further into poverty.Unless the DWP moves to a policy where benefits are paid promptly the queues for food banks in Glasgow, and across the country, will continue growing.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

You still visited the bloke after he had been convicted of having sex with an underage girl. There has been no convincing explanation as to why you should have done so. Indeed, when you tried to explain it, on TV to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis, you sounded both deluded and deceitful.But there’s worse, of course.

It seems certain people are jumping the gun.Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, has dismissed this claim, and stressed the FBI has made several attempts to contact Prince Andrews representatives.It has previously been reported the FBI had been trying to interview the under-fire royal since November.Mr Bermans office revealed the prince’s lack of cooperation on Monday during a dramatic press conference outside Epstein’s mansion.He said: “The Southern District of New York and the FBI have contacted Prince Andrew’s attorneys and requested to interview Prince Andrew, and to date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation.”The top prosecutor said he was revealing the information because the prince “publicly offered, indeed in a press release, to cooperate with law enforcement investigating the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators”.Speaking at the press conference – held to promote a new law to make it easier for child sex abuse victims to sue – Mr Berman said the probe into Epstein’s network was continuing.Virginia Roberts, an American mum-of-three and now , claims she was forced to have sex with the prince three times when she was a teenager, after being trafficked to him by Epstein.The royal has vehemently denied her claims.Sigrid McCawley, who represents Ms Roberts, said: Prince Andrew should take most seriously the deeply held belief in this country that no one is above the law.She added: Prince Andrews continued refusal to cooperate with the authorities after freely acknowledging that he would be prepared to answer enquiries raises even more questions about the role he played in the international sex trafficking ring Jeffrey Epstein and others operated.Jack Scarola, another lawyer representing Ms Roberts Giuffre, told The Sun: “It is obvious that Prince Andrew is persisting in a pattern of non-cooperation which is now been going on for years.“I would certainly believe that he should recognise his moral obligation to participate in the search for the truth.“With all that the victims of Jeffrey Epstein have been through – over so many years – I would say that they expected nothing dferent.”Andrew claried his intention to co-operate with the FBI following his disastrous interview with BBC’s Newsnight in November.During the BBC interview, Andrew said he would have to consult with his lawyers before testying under oath about his ties to Epstein.But in a statement after the broadcast, he said: “Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations,required.”FBI and federal prosecutors in Manhattan are trying to bring justice for dozens of Epstein’s victims – by going after his alleged accomplices.Epstein, , killed himself in jail last year while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking allegations – following numerous bungled probes into his conduct.Prosecutors had accused him of sexually exploiting dozens of women and girls in New York and Florida before he hanged himself.Shortly after Epstein’s death, Mr Berman issued a statement vowing to continue the investigation into his co-conspirators.They are now said to be zeroing in on Ghislaine Maxwell – a close friend of Andrew – who is alleged to have acted at Epstein’s ‘pimp’.Maxwell – who is currently in hiding – has denied any wrongdoing.Andrew was forced to quit as a frontline royal last year, following his car crash chat with Emily Maitlis on Newsnight.During the interview, he suggested that a photograph showing him and Ms Roberts together in the home of Maxwell was faked.He said he had “no recollection” of meeting Ms Roberts Giuffre and claimed he was at a Pizza Express in Woking on one of the days they were meant to have had sex.When asked whether he regretted continuing his friendship with Epstein, the prince said: “Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming  Yes.”“Unbecoming ” Miss Maitlis replied. “He was a sex offender.”A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment on the FBI claims last night, but a source close to the prince said: “This issue is being dealt with by The Duke of York’s legal team”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There have also been instances of protesting fire- fighters setting themselves alight — albeit with fire extinguishers on hand to douse the flames.You are much more likely to have seen these disturbing scenes on social media than on the television news, probably because such images don’t fit with the anti-Brexit narrative of most UK broadcasters.You see, it was supposed to be Britain that collapsed into chaos, while our continental neighbours basked in the stability allegedly afforded by European Union membership.Most of us are vaguely aware that the image we are often presented of President Emmanuel Macron as the smooth-talking glamour boy of modern European politics is somewhat at odds with the situation on the ground in his country.We have heard a bit about the gilets jaunesprotesters who have been staging huge and sometimes violent protests every weekend across France for more than a year now.But despite France being our closest continental neighbour, we don’t quite know what is going on or why — mainly because these extraordinary scenes are so seldom explained or even covered by flagship news programmes.The truth is that civil stre in France, including the sheer level of violence and fury now being directed at its political establishment and at the police who enforce their will, is in danger of spiralling out of control.In painful contrast to La Belle Epoque, the famous “beautul era” of creativity and gracious living France enjoyed for the  years before the First World War, the country is now sliding into Le Mal Epoque — the bad times, which show little sign of ending.The immediate cause of the latest protests is Macron’s economic reform programme, a dose of unpleasant medicine the French economy probably needs to digest but which its powerful and militant trade unions have no intention of allowing to pass.Macron aims to abolish ious “sweetheart” pension deals enjoyed by dferent occupations, including many public sector groups, and create in their place a single national pension scheme he says will be more affordable and fairer for all.Some groups face having their pensions calculated on their career average earnings for the first time, rather than their final salaries at retirement, as  separate schemes are rolled into one. Everyone is faced with working longer, as the retirement age rises from  to  .Macron is also taking a tougher line on the pay and traditionally quite lax working practices of French public sector employees, which is what the firefighters have taken particular objection to.A six-week transport strike has just ended, while the country is also suffering from a wave of power cuts as electricity workers withdraw their labour.When you throw into the mix other major social problems, such as the alienation and chronic high unemployment suffered by youths from ethnic minorities in the “Banlieues” — grim outer estates that encircle Paris and other major French cities — and the ever-present threat of Islamist terrorist atrocities, then the multiple sources of pessimism and anger among the French public become clear.And that is before the famous gilets jaunes are taken into the equation. These protesters, mainly provincial, traditionally-minded people from small towns and villages, began their demonstrations as a protest against punitive new rates of tax on petrol that Macron had introduced to the acclaim of environmentalists and other fashionable metropolitan groups.That grievance has now morphed into a more general contention that Macron is a president for the rich and well-connected.Leftist union leaders have started to ape the language of the gilets jaunes.Firebrand Philippe Martinez — a kind of French Arthur Scargill — says Macron and his inner-circle are disconnected from reality and need to “shake the hands of a few who actually work”.In British terms, modern France is perhaps best likened to our experience in the s and early ’s, characterised by excessive trade union power, strikes, riots, terrorism, outbursts of police brutality and a general pervading sense of aggression on the streets.With the next French presidential election shaping up as a choice between more Macron or Marine Le Pen, with her Far-Right connections, some in France have started to look across the Channel for a better example.Leading lights in the centre-right Republican Party have even praised Boris Johnson as offering, “a third way between globalists and populists”.As Britain gets ready for a Brexit knees-up tomorrow, with no sign of violence despite the years of political angst we have gone through, we should count our blessings.Many in France would give almost anything to be in our shoes right now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The European Parliament marked it by breaking into song with a rendition of Scots farewell ballad Auld Lang Syne. But thereaposs another much more important musical announcement on Friday... the UK official No. And a battle is raging between Remainers and Brexiteers over which one should claim the top spot. If recent experience is anything to go by, we might see EU anthem Ode to Joy stuck behind on % to % for  Million F**k Offs, a Brexit-themed song by comedian Dominic Frisby. Despite its morbid speed, clunky lyrics and quirkily-dressed singer, it has had nearly half a million views on YouTube, explaining how the British told them to f*** off. As of this morning, a version of Ode to Joy by André Rieu  Johann Strauss Orchestra was at No in the British iTunes download chart. But  Million F**k Offs was not far behind, at number three. And there is barely a day left before the official No is announced at pm on Friday. Latest overall figures from Official Charts are a bit less promising for either side though. As of today Ode to Joy is at No while the pro Brexit song is at No. Will Remainers finally chalk up a win in their long struggle  Weaposll soon find out. It comes after emotive farewell scenes to the UK as the European Parliament officially approved the Brexit deal. MEPs held hands and sang Robert Burnaposs Auld Lang Syne after Britainaposs Brexit bill was approved. Politicians held scarves that read Always United after MEPs backed the Withdrawal Agreement, which was approved by Parliament last week, by voting  for versus  against the Brexit deal, with  abstentions.  Euro MPs took part in an afternoon of emotional speeches - with almost every member speaking saying that Britain would be missed after their exit. MEPs cried as the vote was passed. As British MEPs arrived in the European Parliament, a sign above the chamber could be seen reading: Itaposs not goodbye, itaposs au revoir. But Brexiteers were jubilant. Nigel Farage was gagged during his last speech in Brussels as the Brexit Party leader waved a Union Flag.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailDonald Trump’s right-hand man has offered the UK an olive branch in the Transatlantic row over G giant Huawei. Mike Pompeo stepped back from threats that letting the Chinese firm phone into UK infrastructure could destroy the intelligence relationship between Britain and Washington - or scupper a Brexit trade deal. The US Secretary of State warned the Chinese communist party “presents the central threat of our times” adding: “It’s not about a technical back door. They have the front door.” Warning the deal was a risk, he said: “We will never permit American National Security information to go across a network we do not have trust and confidence in.” And he called for a concerted effort on technology by all of those who love freedom and cherish democracy and the rule of law. But crucially Mr Pompeo added the Five Eyes security relationship “is deep, it is strong, it will remain”. He said: I am very confident that our two nations will find a way to work together to resolve this dference. And he also tried to scotch talk that the Huawei decision could ruin a post-Brexit trade deal - by repeating Donald Trumpaposs pledge that Britain will be front of the line. He told a Policy Exchange event in Westminster: The previous administration took the view thatthe United Kingdom made this decision it would be at the back of the line. We intend to put the United Kingdom at the front of the line. Mr Pompeo even said he would be working to seal a US-UK trade deal before Donald Trumpaposs re-election bid in November. Despite deep rts over US v EU food standards like chlorine-washed chicken, Mr Pompeo claimed a US-UK trade deal was an enormous opportunity to set a model for what the standards are going to look like for others”.  Mr Pompeo spoke on a UK visit as he took part in a QA with UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. Mike Pompeo was due to meet the Prime Minister in Downing Street after insisting Huawei presents a real risk to security. Mr Pompeo added: We will never permit American international security information to go across a network that we donapost have trust and confidence in.  Thataposs the standard, whether it is a Microsoft system, it is the same whether it is a Erion Nokia system, thataposs the standardit is a Chinese system. We will work with our UK counterparts, and I know the Australians, the New Zealanders, all others in the Five Eyes, will work together to ensure the systems are sufficiently secure and they are going to deliver the outcomes we need them to deliver, and that we have only a level of risk in the system that we find tolerable. Iaposm sure that we will protect American information to that standard.

The Chancellor promised just months ago that no department would have to shrink their budgets in . But today he wrote to cabinet ministers, asking them to draw up cuts of up to % of their spending plans. They’ve been told to go through their budgets “line by line” and be ready to justy any spending plans and projects they want to keep. In the note, Mr Javid wrote: “We have been elected with a clear fiscal mandate to keep control of day to day spending. “This means there will need to be savings made across government to free up money to invest in our priorities.”  But in Mr Javid’s spending round speech, just three months before the election, the Chancellor declared he had “turned the page on austerity.” Mr Javid said: No department will be cut next year. Every single department has had its budget for day to day spending increased at least in line with inflation. Thataposs what I mean by the end of austerity.Labouraposs Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: We were promised by Johnson and Javid that austerity had ended and the cuts in public services were over. They clearly aren’t on this evidence. Another Johnson lie exposed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"baby undergoes now never surgery","story":"w.mantis  A mum has revealed her heartbreak at learning her unborn son had spina bida and needed to operated on while he was still in the womb.  nJoanne Crellin, , was  weeks pregnant when she flew to Belgium to try and fix her unborn childaposs spina bida.  nSpina bida is when a babyaposs spine and spinal cord donapost develop properly in the womb, reports the Liverpool Echo.  nThe condition leaves vital nerves exposed as the pregnancy progresses, causing irreparable damage.  nMum-of-four Joanne was shocked to be told about the issue when she had her -week scan.  nJust two months later she claimed she had been informed everything was fine two months earlier.  n  nBoy, , paralysed after freak accident while playing on the sofa with his dogs  nDisabled woman forced to drag herself along floor after two year battle for help   nShe said: Shaun [her partner] and I were laughing on the way into the hospital - thataposs what gets me.  nThey gave me a leaflet after I was told [about the spina bida] and I couldnapost even look at it - I felt physically sick.  nItaposs still something that really upsets me.  n  nManaposs heartache after losing three babies in three years - leaving him in aposfatherhood limboapos   nShe had to rush off to Belgium because there were no surgeons available in the UK.  nJoanne was also informed that her baby had hydrycepahlus- which helped her make the decision.  nShe was asked to stay near the hospital in Liverpool following the successful operation on October  - meaning she was away from her family for three months.  nShe then gave birth to little Blay on December  via caesarean section.  n  nHero trainee nurse saves five-year-old girl’s le while on holiday in Majorca   nThe effect of the surgery is currently unclear and could be for some time, only becoming evident as the baby grows.  nBut Joanne, from Douglas on the Isle of Man, is just happy that sheaposs given her boy a fighting chance.  nShe said: When I touch his feet they donapost move at all - they donapost clench.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum has revealed her heartbreak at learning her unborn son had spina bida and needed to operated on while he was still in the womb. Joanne Crellin, , was  weeks pregnant when she flew to Belgium to try and fix her unborn childaposs spina bida.Spina bida is when a babyaposs spine and spinal cord donapost develop properly in the womb, reports the Liverpool Echo.The condition leaves vital nerves exposed as the pregnancy progresses, causing irreparable damage. Mum-of-four Joanne was shocked to be told about the issue when she had her -week scan. Just two months later she claimed she had been informed everything was fine two months earlier. She said: Shaun [her partner] and I were laughing on the way into the hospital - thataposs what gets me. They gave me a leaflet after I was told [about the spina bida] and I couldnapost even look at it - I felt physically sick. Itaposs still something that really upsets me.  She had to rush off to Belgium because there were no surgeons available in the UK. Joanne was also informed that her baby had hydrycepahlus- which helped her make the decision. She was asked to stay near the hospital in Liverpool following the successful operation on October  - meaning she was away from her family for three months. She then gave birth to little Blay on December  via caesarean section.  The effect of the surgery is currently unclear and could be for some time, only becoming evident as the baby grows. But Joanne, from Douglas on the Isle of Man, is just happy that sheaposs given her boy a fighting chance. She said: When I touch his feet they donapost move at all - they donapost clench. Itaposs quite obvious he doesnapost have any feeling. He wonapost have full sensation - it would be deluded to think so. But he might have another operation which can bring back a bit. The biggest reason was I wanted to prevent him having a shuntbecause of where I am. If he did, every time it became blocked I would have to travel to hospital in Liverpool.  And, after the shunt has happened,you put them down to sleep it can be fatal - I wanted to protect him from that. At first I wasnapost sure about having it but I went home and researched what the outcome was. Because in spine bida the nerve endings are on the spine, itaposs the amniotic fluid around the baby that actually causes the damage. As the pregnancy progresses the baby is getting bigger and pressing the nerve endings against you - which are getting squashed. All the damage is done in the womb but the fetal surgery covers the exposed nerve endings so you canapost have further damage. Fetal spina bida surgery was first carried in the UK in .  Joanne had to undergo a series of tests after she agreed to the surgery during her -week scan including genetic testing, a psychological assessment and an MRI scan. She then packed her bags and went to London for what she expected to be an overnight stay - but actually beginning a whirlwind three months. She said: The next day I was sitting in a café waiting for my MRI when the hospital rang me and said they already had someone booked in for surgery for the date I would have to have mine. So, the only way for me to be able to have it done would be to go to Brussels. I asked them when I need to go and they said: aposWell youaposve got an appointment there at tomorrow at  oaposclockapos. I thought: aposHow am I supposed to get to Brussels apos. I didnapost even know where it was!  A friend came to her rescue and booked her on the Eurostar and into a hotel for two nights. Joanne added: I was then in the hospital family room for two nights and then I had the surgery. At first they were finding things with his brain and they werenapost sure about having it done but then they said it was fine. Joanne stayed in Brussels for a week following the successful operation on October  then flew back to Liverpool. She was advised to stay in the city until the birth as there was a high risk of rupture - forcing her to check into a nearby bed and breakfast for the next few months.  Blay was then born on December  via caesarean section at Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital and stayed in intensive care for four days. He was then moved to Alder Hey Hospital where staff pulled out all the stops to get the baby home in time for Christmas. Itaposs now a matter of waiting to see how successful the surgery was as Blay starts to grow - but thereaposs every reason to be hopeful. Joanne said: They did say to me in Brussels that my surgery was an hour quicker than theyaposd done it before and they managed to get four layers on him when usually they would get three. He no longer has hydrocephalus and his cerebellum was pulled down but now itaposs coming back into its proper position. You canapost tellhe will need a shunt but Iaposm feeling positive that he wonapost and he does have feeling in his legs apart from his feet. Itaposs known as a apossnowflake disabilityapos. You can have a baby that has the area on their spine affected in exactly the same place but the outcome wonapost be the same.

Earlier this week a store in Birmingham was branded as Britainaposs roughest after putting up security wiring to protect team members. But now it has emerged a branch in Nottingham has a bulletproof shield which separates staff from the public. Customers at the branch on Alfreton Road are greeted by the unsightly screen which covers most of the serving area. Residents who dine there have described it as a sign of the times but say although they feel like being served at a bank it doesnapost put them off eating there. Dad-of-one Connor Turley, , a fencer from Nottingham - which at one time was referred to as aposShottinghamapos over sky-high gun crime - said: I use this place quite a lot and didnapost realise it was unusual. I guess they have to think of the safety of their staff, which around this area is a good idea as itaposs a bit rough around the edges. Itaposs a sign of the times we are living in unfortunately.  Student Laura Horrocks, , from Hockley, Nottingham, added: It doesnapost put me off, but I try not to come here at night. Nottingham isnapost as bad as it was for gun crime but it still has a pretty bad reputation. Tim Brown, , an insurance worker, from Aspley, Nottingham, added: It must be quite unsettling to work behind bullet proof glass but I understand why it is there.You can never be too careful these days but Iaposve never seen it anywhere . Itaposs like ordering your food at a bank or a petrol station after hours. One staff member at the store said today: Itaposs been like it for a while. Thereaposs not been any incidents since I worked here, but itaposs there to keep us safe. A spokeswoman for KFC toldthe bulletproof glass has always been there in the Nottingham store, since the branch opened, and could not comment further.

Nicola, who has an eight-year-old son, was horried to see a large selection for sale in the Tesco superstore in Plymouth.The store has a range of cards for children to send to their parents and parents to send to their children, including Spiderman and Frozen themes.But Nicola told Plymouth Live she would punch anyone in the face who sent her child a Valentineaposs Day card and said itaposs not normal.She believes Valentineaposs Day is for adult relationships and that it is an attempt to normalise abnormal relationships with children, adding anyone who sends a child a card needs locking up. The -year-old said she raised the issue with staff and called the customer service team, who apparently told her that parents show their affection in dferent ways and it would not be removing the cards from the shelf. Tescoaposs said they provide the cards so that everyone can take part in the day. But Nicola told: Thereaposs one that says, aposDaddy loves you lots like jelly totsapos, thataposs weird. This is not normal. Valentine’s Day is for lovers. It’s not something that you should involve children in. It’s not something that a normal person would think of sending a child. It’s wrong. Nicola said that a number of her friends agreed with her and that she hoped the store would remove the cards.  She said: They [Tesco] told me they’re not going to remove them from the shelves. It’s really weird, it doesn’t quite sit right. They [Tesco] told me that some parents show their affection in dferent ways, but I think they need locking up. As a parent,anyone was to give my son that card I’d be punching them in the face. The children’s ones I do not think are appropriate. Nicola believes that primary schools should ban Valentineaposs Day.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum had to have two skin grafts after a birthmark turned cancerous - leaving medics with no choice but to operate. Kristina Findalen, , was diagnosed after the seemingly-innocuous ark on her right palm suddenly started to change while on holiday in Italy. It began to itch, lost its colour and grew suddenly. The saleswoman, from Copenhagen, Denmark, was diagnosed with cancer after being referred to a dermatologist. She said: Summer  I noticed ithad changed colour and gotten bigger and started to itch. It was just a little brown dot and then around the summer time we were in Italy for three weeks and itaposs because my dad has some spots on his back and I said to him, aposI would go to the doctor with these onesapos and he didnapost want to.I looked at my hand and it was starting to itch also and then it lost its colour and it got twice the size so I thought I better get it checked out, I canapost say go to the doctor to my dad and not do it myself.As soon as I could I went to the doctors and she sent me to a specialist dermatologist. There was about three months of waiting and when I got to her she was like, aposI will send you to the cancer unit immediatelyapos.Two days after I was at the dermatologists I had to go to the hospital. They took the biopsy and then ran tests and I got an answer ten days later - I was going to the hospital to have the stitches taken out so I got the results then.Unfortunately for Kristina, the results of the biopsy had shown that she had developed stage one melanoma- a common type of skin cancer, in her birthmark.Fortunately, the disease had been caught in the early stages and could be treated. Kristinaaposs le had already been turned upside down  months previously when she and her husband of  years split. Five months later he committed suicide, devastating her and their two children.The single-mother-of-two was advised that surgery to remove the cancer would be the most successful route. She was told that a skin graft would cover the deep wound on her hand, but the surgery only resulted in more problems.Normally when you hear aposcancerapos you associate it with death. I was in shock and thought it was nothing, it was just a birthmark, and I didnapost see that it could be cancer really, said Kristina.Theysaid that they had to remove it surgically, that was the best outcome with melanoma. I went into survival mode. My kids only have me after their dad died in May , so I refused to think that I wouldnapost beat this sickness.We had just kind of got back to normal, well as normal as possible, and then I got this diagnosis and it came crashing down all over again.On December , I had my first surgery where they removed my cancer and skin graft from my thigh. They unfortunately damaged a nerve to my little finger - it is a risk with the surgery because in the hand you have no fat layer, itaposs all muscle and bone and nerves its very compact, so it is a risk. Luckily, Kristina has been given the all-clear from her cancer. In May  she needed a second operation to replace her damaged nerve with a donor nerve, followed by a second skin graft.Despite this, she still has ongoing issues with the damage caused by the surgery, but she hopes that sharing her story will help others who are going through a similar diagnosis."},{"url":null,"title":"pub accused snobbery after banning","story":"w.mantis  A pub has banned ‘jobby catcher’ grey tracksuits and shoes with no socks in crackdown on hipsters - but has defended accusation of snobbishness.  nThe Dreadnought in Leith, Edinburgh, describes itself as old skool and a pub that knows how to party.  nIt won the Campaign for Real AleCity of Edinburgh Pub of the Year award in  and .  nBut the trendy boozer has raised eyebrows by putting a sign in the window - telling men they will not be allowed inthey are dressed head-to-toe in grey marl trackies, or wearing shoes with no socks.  nThe Dreadnought is also considering a ban on flip-flops.  nA sign, reading gentlemen’s dress code depicted a man dressed in a grey tight-fitting tracksuit cuffed at the ankles and trainers, described as jobby catchers.  n  nUber customer gobsmacked after being charged £ for -minute journey   nLollipop man banned from high-fiving pupils after one complaint about his aposbehaviourapos   n   nAnother image showed a man wearing a leather jacket and turned-up jeans, with bare ankles and smart shoes - circled in red to draw attention to the fashion aposfaux pasapos.  nThe move was welcomed by some people, who called for the ban to be extended to other items of clothing.  nGary Saddler said: “Their pub.

Scotland Yard has asked Neil Berriman, , to pass on all the evidence he has collected in his four-year investigation to find the missing killer. Neil, the son of nanny Sandra Rivett, who Lucan is suspected of murdering in , said: “I’m pleased they are taking it so seriously.” After his claim was revealed by the Mirror yesterday, the building contractor is now due to meet Det Insp Susan Stansfield, of the major inquiries special casework team at Putney police station in South West London. Neil said: “I know DI Stansfield is out of the country working on another investigation so I am pleased ... she will be meeting me at the first possible opportunity.I am very grateful for the police’s quick response.” The Mirror revealed that Neil had spent £, of his own money trying to track down Lucan and claimed to have found the elusive peer living as a Buddhist in Australia. Neil has already told Det Insp Stansfield about the eight aliases he believes the man has been using.And he has passed on the address where the man is living. Lucan would now be . Scotland Yard said: “The inquiry into the death of Sandra Rivett remains open, as is the case with all unsolved murders. “It has never been closed. Any signicant new information will be considered.”Lucan disappeared shortly after Sandra was bludgeoned to death. George Bingham, the son of the peer who has been th Earl of Lucan since his father was declared dead in , said he had been unaware of Neil’s search.The -year-old added: “I’ve met him a couple of times but had no idea he was looking for him and had spent so much... “He isn’t the first person to go to Australia looking.I remember the press went out there to try and find my father and instead found John Stonehouse who had faked his own death.”He added: “I am very sceptical about this. I had seen the story and it does seem odd. It would not be the first time someone has made a mistake. “This is all ancient history. It happened in  and now it’s . I guess people will always go on looking and they are welcome to do so.” He also revealed that on December , he and his we had a baby son Charles, who is in line to become the th Earl of Lucan. The Earl said: “I’ve more important things to worry about such as sleepless nights. My son is not sleeping very well.” Shortly after the murder, Lucan drove to the home of his friends in East Sussex and wrote a letter to a pal, asking that his children be looked after because he was going to lie low “for a bit”. ‘Spotted’ on a volcano and at ex-Nazi colony There are a huge number of theories on what became of Lord Lucan and long list of “sightings” – from backpacking on a volcano to living as a hippy in India. Some believe he boarded a ferry at Newhaven, others think he got on a private jet at Headcorn in Kent to fly across the Channel where he was picked up by a limo.  And one source insisted he had committed suicide and his body was then fed to tigers at the Kent zoo owned by his pal John Aspinall. Det Chief Supt Roy Ranson, who led the original murder investigation, claimed in his book that he believed Lucan fled to Africa with the help of influential friends. He was convinced that the discovery of Lucan’s car in Newhaven was a red herring. He also believed Lucan flew to Portugal in a private plane belonging to former Formula One champion Graham Hill, who died in . Later “evidence” suggested that Lucan was in Mozambique in . The first reported sighting of Lucan was in January  when he was supposedly spotted in Melbourne, Australia. Five months later he was “seen” in France at Cherbourg and St Malo. Police in South Africa examined fingerprints, supposedly left on a beer glass by Lucan in Cape Town. Sightings were reported in southern Africa, first in Mozambique and then Zimbabwe, and there were even claims he lived in India as a hippy called “Jungle Barry”. He was also “spotted”at an ex-Nazi colony in Paraguay, a sheep station in the Australian outback and backpacking on Mt Etna, Sicily. In , Barbados Police were asked by Scotland Yard to investigate reports that a British resident was sending money to Lord Lucan in South America. An ITV drama claimed the peer had been spirited away by wealthy friends, including Sir James Goldsmith and Aspinall.

The Tories have finally ­realised this could not continue and have taken the service back into public ownership. Northern Rail’s customers will only really notice a dferencethe Government starts to invest in new track, electrication and signalling. The demise of Northern Rail should sound the death knell for rail privatisation. The policy, rammed through by John Major, is a total failure. It is not just in the North that passengers have been fleeced by train operating companies, as bosses have grown fat from public subsidies while providing an appalling service for ever-higher ticket prices. The only thing preventing the Tories from ending this fiasco is their ideological blindness. It is time for the blinkers to come off. If it makes sense to take Northern Rail into public ownership then it makes sense that the rest of the railways should be nationalised. The loyal mint  Uncle Joe’s Mint Balls in Wigan has made a special edition to honour a former employee who served in the Second World War. We can’t think of a sweeter tribute. It’s not justice The Grenfell Inquiry has already heard that firms which made and installed the cladding knew it was a potential fire risk. Now these companies are demanding immunity from prosecution before staff give evidence. This is deeply insulting to the survivors and the families of the victims, who deserve the truth. Anyone who withholds evidence adds further stress and anguish to people who have already suffered unimaginable trauma and grief.

A husband and we from Macau have been isolated in separate rooms on the Costa Smeralda after the -year-old woman came down with a fever and breathing dficulties on Wednesday night during a seven-day Mediterranean cruise. The two have been checked by an on-board doctor and undergone tests to find outthey have the SARS-like virus, which has killed at least  people in China and infected more than , others. There are about  Chinese nationals on the Smeralda, including the Macau woman, who has been isolated in shipaposs hospital, and her husband, who has not shown any symptoms and is in isolation as a precaution. If they are carrying the killer bug, there are fears that it could have already spread to hundreds of others on board the vessel, which docked at a port in Civitavecchia, north-west of Rome, on Thursday with about , passengers and , crew who are not wearing masks. Are you on board the Costa Smeralda  Email webnews@mirror.   The Chinese couple arrived at Milanaposs Malpensa Airport on Saturday on a flight from Hong Kong and then travelled about  miles to the port of Savona, where they boarded the Smeralda the same day. The ,-ft long ship had made previous stops this week in Mallorca, Barcelona and Marseille en route back to Italy. Officials wearing masks have boarded the vessel in Civitavecchia and it is unknownit will continue its journey back to Savona, where it is due to arrive on Saturday. It is understood that the Chinese coupleaposs blood samples were being tested at a hospital in Rome. The ship is being held until the results come back.  Passengers, who were meant to go on a day trip to Rome, said it is possible that everyone will be forced off in Civitavecchia to undergo medical screening. The ship is due to leave Civitavecchia at pm local time, but the rest of the journey is now in doubt. One crew member who disembarked the ship on Tuesday evening and is now in Germany has been sent home from work and told to stay home until further notice, the Mirror understands.  Gaby, a passenger from Argentina who is trapped on the ship, tweeted: Arriving in Rome on the Costa Smeralda cruise ship and they are not letting us get off the boat. They say there is a sanitary inspection. We have gone  hours without information.  She later wrote: The captain of the Costa Smeralda says that, because of the #coronavirus, the sanitary controls in the ports will be more exhaustive. Speaking from the vessel, Gaby told : We are worried. We have no information. We donapost know what will happen next oreveryone will have to be screened. Italian passenger Filippo Rossi, , posted photos of tired travellers sat on the floor and in dining or common areas as they waited for updates. Another snap shows police officers stood on the dock.  Mr Rossi, from Rome, wrote: Meanwhile in Civitavecchia we are stuck in Costa ship without knowing the reason . He told : People are mostly tired. We are worried because officially on board crew say nothing about. They talk about aposnormalapos controls. We donapost know when weaposll disembark the ship. Mr Rossi and another passenger, Marina Guerrero, , said British citizens are on board the Smeralda. Ms Guerrero, from Badalona, Spain, said passengers had been left in the dark.  She said: We have no information about what is happening. All we know is what has been posted on the internet. Everything is normal on board. Serge Simard told : Everything is calm. Too bad they cancelled our tour to Rome. They said the sanitary inspection should last  minutes. That was around .am. Then once every  or  minutes we received an update saying to wait.Then at .pm they cancelled our tour to Rome. I personally learned why reading the news online.  Mr Simard said he wasnapost worried about coronavirus, adding: Seems like the people we have met are enjoying their vacations, so are we. No-one was being allowed off the ship while medical checks were carried out to seethe Chinese couple had the potentially deadly coronavirus, a Costa Cruises spokesman said. He said it might take a few hours before the situation became clearer.Passenger Maria Cartagena tweeted a photo of holidaymakers in a swimming pool, writing: All normal on board #costasmeralda awaiting evidence of #coronavirus to passengers of Asian origin. Ship locked in #civitavecchia. Earlier, she wrote: Does anyone know how long it takes for tests to detect it  They are doing checks on  Chinese passengers and for nowthey donapost tell us anything . A bit of burden. Another passenger, from France, tweeted: What do we do now   hours waiting to go on an excursion with  announcements to say that these are aposnormal checksapos,that were the case you would have anticipated and we would already be in Rome on an excursion. Where is the travel info   On board of #CostaSmeralda, few announcements from @costacroisieres, waiting since : this morning to find out who, why, how ... meanwhile we have more info here [on Twitter] than on board. The situation is delicate of course but leaving passengers in a fog is unacceptable. There are  Chinese nationals on the Smeralda, including  who boarded in Savona with the Macau woman and her husband, Ansa reported. Russiaaposs embassy in Rome said it was monitoring the situation and prepared to provide assistance to any of its citizens on the Smeralda. A Costa Cruises spokesman said: Costa Cruises confirms the sanitary protocol has been activated for a guest on board Costa Smeralda. The guest, a -year-old lady of Chinese nationality, has been in isolation in the on board hospital since last night together with her travel mate, in line with health protocols.  As soon as the suspected case was detected, the medical team on board immediately activated all the relevant health procedures to promptly isolate and manage the clinical condition. The Health Authority has been immediately notied and is now on board to conduct all the pertinent measures.  It is our utmost priority to ensure the health and safety of passengers and crew. The company is at complete disposal of the Health Authority and their indication will be strictly applied. Costa Cruises continue to apply the relevant national policies and epidemic developments, as per World Health Organisation and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indications. Costa Smeralda reached Civitavecchia this morning, coming from Palma de Mallorca.  The ship is operating seven-day cruises in West Med, including Civitavecchia, La Spezia, Savona, Marseille, Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca. Ernesto Tedesco, mayor of Civitavecchia, told TRC Giornale: There is a suspected case of coronavirus at the port of Civitavecchia. The Harbour Masteraposs Office said the situation was under control. Vincenzo Leone, a commander of the Lazio coastguard, told la Repubblica: We are waiting for the outcome of the checks still in progress, but everything that needed to be done has been done. The situation is under control and at the moment, there is no reason for concern on board. The brand new ship, which made its inaugural voyage in December, has a maximum capacity for just over , passengers and , crew.  Costa Cruises announced on Thursday that it was cancelled nine cruises from China due to the outbreak. Health experts have expressed fears that Chinese holidaymakers could spread the virus during journeys abroad. It can take days for symptoms to appear and doubts have been cast on the effectiveness of screening measures at airports. Like other respiratory infections, coronavirus is transmitted between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes.

The UK has not had a confirmed case yet, although health experts have warned that the virus is likely already here.  More than  people have been tested in Britain, but all results have come back negative. Johns Hopkinsapos live map uses data from the World Health Organisation and the US Centers for Disease Control. Prof Lauren Gardner, who helped to create the map, said: “We built this dashboard because we think it is important for the public to have an understanding of the outbreak situation as it unfolds with transparent data sources.  “For the research community, this data will become more valuable as we continue to collect it over time.” Britain aposmost at risk of outbreak in Europeapos Meanwhile, experts at Southampton University have found that a coronavirus outbreak is more likely in Britain than any other country in Europe. The UK is on the front line in the battle against the killer disease - owing to the number of Chinese visitors.  More than , tourists arrive in London alone between January and the middle of March every year. Researchers at Southampton University measured the potential global spread for the first time, finding the UK was the most at-risk nation on the continent. Globally, it was ranked th, after the USand Australia- with London the th most vulnerable city across the world. Thailand, which has the most cases outside of China as of Thursday morning, topped the list of countries most at risk.

It’s just so easy, right in the centre of London. Apparently, they’ve just started the service to Dundee. It used to be Stansted, which is basically in Norwich and everything happens in London, man.

It looks like clfs, or maybe a ship. Right next to an actual ship called The Discovery. The museum has a Dame Mary Quant exhibition. I dig her style. And I’m coming back for the nightclub exhibition all about the design of hang-outs such as Studio , Haciencda and The Ministry of Sound. Sick.pm: Dundee has some cool hotels, man. I like the look of Malmaison but imagine staying somewhere without a spa. Hilarious. I’ve come to the Home of Golf, to the Old Course Hotel in St Andrews just  minutes away. I think my jeans might be a too tight for a quick nine holes but yoga in my suite with champagne will do the trick.pm Probably just as well this place doesn’t have any nightclubs. I want to be fresh for tomorrow – apparently there will be , people. Zayne Malik eat my dust.Saturday May Noon Massage, rooftop jacuzzi, breakfast overlooking the famous courseand now heading for a sound check. I hope it’s not awkward with Calvin tomorrow – the whole Taylor Swt thing – but come on, loads of guys have dated the same girl.

I think we can play better than in the first game – there is always room for improvement.“Once the game settled down, we showed we could cope. They had their spells of pressure, we had ours.“There was a bit of uncertainty over how the first game was going to go but,we show the confidence and belief we have done over the past few months, show how good a team we are, then, hopefully, it will work out the right way.“We’re confident. We know it will be tough but we can get through.”At the weekend, United prolonged the impressive run of form that’s seen them avoid defeat in all competitions since the middle of October with a last-gasp header from Lawrence Shankland .That came after the Tangerines trailed a stubborn Morton outfit for more than  minutes as it seemed their unbeaten league home record was at risk.Pawlett, though, says he was always confident they would level things up.He added: “We’ve been in good form and we want to stay unbeaten for the rest of the season.“Shanks popped up again and saved us on Saturday but I always knewwe kept plugging away it would come.“We were delighted to get the point in the end and results went our way where, so it is a point gained in the big picture.“We’re  points clear, we’re in a strong position, but we just need to focus on keeping results coming and, hopefully, win the league.”It’s not the first time United have trailed going into the closing stages of matches this season.Stoke eye late move for Shankland, joining interest from Rangers, Celtic and QPR\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp shankland-continuing-to-attract-interest-as-stoke-eye-a-late-move embed # secretRRWBZHkWm\" data-secret\"RRWBZHkWm\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"And Pawlett reckons that character shown by the players could serve them well tonight heading to a dficult venue.“Against Arbroath earlier in the season at Tannadice it was a similar situation to Saturday,” he added.“Unfortunately this time we didn’t get the three points but we kept our unbeaten run going.“At the end we showed our character and belief.“We want to get the job done.

The blaze was described in council reports as #catastrophic# with #around % of teaching rooms signicantly damaged#.Mr Alexander said: #There is a real need for improvement in the east of the city.#We have spent £m since  and invested in new schools and that is not including the £m spent on existing schools.#But we cannot afford to build two brand new schools.#The plan,we get agreement for a full consultation, is to merge Craigie and Braeview Academy.#We are looking at what happened in Fe after a fire when there was a merger with a college. We see this as the way and Dundee and Angus College would be involved in taking this forward, with enhanced provision.#Both these schools are grade C in terms of quality and both need upgrading but looking at the financial elements we cannot afford it.#The priority is in the east and we cannot have Braeview Academy people sitting in portable cabins.#Mr Alexander, a former pupil of St Saviour#s High School, outlined how #vocational partnerships# between Braeview and Michelin would be continued at the new campus at Drumgeith Road.He added that a joint project between Dundee City Council and Dundee and Angus College would be launched to accommodate people with additional support needs.Mr Alexander said: #I spoke with three executives from Michelin and we are really focused on making things work.#The consultation,approved by committee on Monday, would start on February  and run until the end of March. We have to be honest with the public and we want the feedback from parents.#This is the very start of the process. And as a parent your focus is absolutely on what is in the best interests of your children.#Part of the consultation process will be looking at proposals for Craigiebarns to be part of the catchment area for Grove. That would take effect from August , so again there is a lead in time to give people the time to give feedback.#He told how boundaries are to be changed to help accommodate the uneven mix of schools which are under capacity and those which are over capacity both in primary and secondary.Turning his attention to the over side of the city, Mr Alexander said: #The re-alignment catchment areas for Harris Academy would remove Invergowrie and they would go to school in Perth.#Meanwhile, the future of a  much-vaunted new primary is also hanging in the balance — at least in the short-term.The council leader hinted that he understood that was likely to be a controversial decision.#We have also had a very detailed analysis of how many pupils in the area of Western Gateway and which schools they go to,# Mr Alexander continued.#There are  pupils on site , but we need to address the other issues with the priority being at the east end of the city, so Western Gateway is not a priority. This is not the time to do it and we cannot construct a primary school on the basis of  pupils.#We are not saying no to the school, but it is just not the right time now.

All week we’d been really positive so we need to go back and build on that for the next game.“I think I showed them my game – bit of pace, drop the shoulder and get a ball into the box.“Cutting in and having a shot as well, that’s the type of player I am.“I’d been playing with the U s at Wigan, Dundee came down to watch me in the Liverpool game a couple of weeks back.“I done well, we won the game and that’s where the interest came from. I’m really happy to be here.“I don’t know much about Scotland or the league but I know it’s a really competitive ision.“Hopefully, I can make an impact by getting a few goals and assists.” vw, px\"  Although not clued up on the Scottish game, Crankshaw is no stranger to the blood and thunder approach having cut his teeth in non-league football after being released by home town club Preston North End and then Morecambe.His route to Dens Park has taken in such footballing-hotbeds as Ramsbottom United, Clitheroe, Colne and Curzon Ashton but Crankshaw believes that has made him the character he is today.“My pathway has been dferent to a lot of other players but I think it shows that I’m hard-working, dedicated and just want to play football really,” he added.“Most people come through the youth ranks but I’ve went my way and it’s a little bit dferent.“Hopefully, I can get where I want to be and have a career in the game. I’ve seen the worst of it but I think that builds you and carves your career.“It builds you as a player to not take anything for granted. You can drop out of the game but,you work hard, you can make it back.”Given their toils of late in the Championship, Crankshaw believes that drive to turn things around is something the Dark Blues can employ to get their season back on track.“We need to find some consistency. I think we’ve definitely got the squad to go and push for promotion.“We need to put a run of games together and get back to winning, where Dundee should be.”He has been made to feel at home in Dundee despite not knowing many people, and is even flat-sharing with back-up goalkeeper Calum Ferrie, as he gets used to the city’s football culture.“All the squad have been really good with me, introducing me to everyone.“I came up late Thursday night and the manager met me. He’s been really good with me.“Everyone’s made me really welcome so, hopefully, we can get back to being confident and up there. We’re willing and I think we will do.“I don’t know many of the lads but they’ve all been really welcoming so it’s been really good.“I’m friends with Cal so I’m staying with him in the flat so he’s been making me tea and stuff! He’s been good with me and helping me to settle in.“Staying in Dundee has been good, I couldn’t believe it when I saw the two stadiums and how close they are.“It’s a really nice city, I haven’t seen much of it but, hopefully, I can get to know it.“Hopefully, we can go get a few goals, a few wins and put the points back on the board.“We can build from that and, once we get one, I think they’ll come.

Ultimately he’s defending his colleague and friend who is having his ability brought into question.“But a head-on dismissal of supporter opinion is always risky.“Fans – the leblood of the club – are entitled to express their views and you might expect the management team to respectnot accept it.”Although Aberdeen are sitting fourth in the Premiership and are in the fth round of the Scottish Cup, Smith believes some of the performances this season have been underwhelming.He said: “As far as recent results and performances are concerned, itcould be deemed fair.“The results have not been there and the performances have been disjointed.“While the players can’t be immune to criticism either – and plenty has come their way, too – a level of sympathy sits with them because there’s such a lack of continuity and consistency in both personnel and the tactical approach.“Injuries do mitigate that somewhat but not as far as to explain recent efforts. Generally speaking, the support seems split into two arguments: those who say to look where we were before McInnes took over and those who feel we’re underperforming given current expectations and resources.“Both opinions have their merits but the latter is most prevalent, certainly on social media and increasingly so in the stands.“You would imagine it is certainly of more relevance to the board.”Under McInnes Aberdeen have won the League Cup in  and reached three more cup finals as well as finishing second in the Premiership four times, third once and fourth once and have qualied for European football for six successive seasons.However, Smith believes there has been a decline in performances in recent times.He said: “Looking back on the season so far there have been only a small number of matches in which Aberdeen’s superiority in quality and finances has been evident in the scoreline and performance. Especially in terms of entertainment value.“The manager often laments the departure of quality players and the loss ofHayes,McLean andShinnie in successive seasons has eroded the identity and tempo that was so effective in McInnes’ first few seasons.“This slump has been accentuated by what’s happening off the pitch. Efforts, successful so far, to improve the atmosphere and match day experience will be easily undermined when at the heart of enjoyment is the performance of the team.“If that continues a ‘football decision’ may become a business one for the board. Uefa figures show how important clicks of the turnstile are for Scottish football and Aberdeen need all the fans they can get.“You can’t always expect showtime football. Sometimes it is about getting the job done, but that flair and intent has been missing for the last two seasons.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49966117-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49966117-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49966117-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49966117-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"northern goal the north of scotland football podcast from the evening express and press and journal","story":"Northern Goal is the north of Scotland football podcast from the Evening Express and Press and Journal, with new episodes released every Tuesday.We’ll discuss all of the issues surrounding Aberdeen, Ross County, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Peterhead, Cove Rangers, Elgin City and the Highland League.Apple Podcasts: https:podcasts.apple gb podcast northern-goal idSpoty: https:open.spoty show yJamczTcjQbkEIEcQOr search “Northern Goal” in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal .

Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub.

The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness. But the seat, the box and most of all the stories, stopped Jessicarsquos nana from melting."},{"url":null,"title":"overturned-tractor-near-torness-caused-a1-delays","story":"Reports of the incident, which happened on the westbound carriageway first emerged at .pm and a contraflow system was originally put in place.Police were on the scene at about .pm and temporarily held traffic on both sides of the road in order to recover the vehicle.The road was fully re-opened in both directions shortly before .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"youths-tried-kick-in-new-community-shelter-north-berwick","story":"At the grouprsquos meeting last Tuesday, community councillor Bill Macnair highlighted the issue to his fellow members.He said: ldquoOne or two youths have been spotted trying to break the shelter in the Lodge.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness.

To turn the area over to commercial activities from November, with an unsightly and unpassable clear-up lasting from January to May, is to commandeer the place for more than half the year. Eight weeks would be acceptable  is not.Naturally, this eyesore wont be published on any VisitScotland website. Most sightseers wont ever catch a glimpse of this inglorious aftermath. Meanwhile, between now and the middle of May, those who live and work in Edinburgh must pass by and avert their gaze, wondering how their city became a mere pawn of the entertainment industry and not an illustrious capital of which they could once be proud. As one of many disgruntled locals tweeted, this is ruination \"in the name of greed\".I cannot think of a city of comparable elegance, venerability and wealth ndash a Unesco World Heritage Centre to boot ndash where the first thing you see as you emerge from the train station, or arrive from the airport is a wasteland. Welcome to Scotland! Here we dont roll out the red carpet, but ndash after an agonisingly long delay ndash we do renew the turf.Theres a palpable feeling at the moment that Edinburgh is undergoing seismic change, under our noses but without public consent. News last week that planning regulations could be relaxed to allow restaurants, cafes, and a host of other non-retail outfits to move into Princes Street is a fresh cause for concern. If approved, this new dispensation could mean that one of Europes most beguiling bouleds ndash the street that sells Scotland ndash could become home to a casino, cinema, or even a sports facility.Why should this concern us  Given the tawdry quality of some of the shops currently trading, wouldnt bright cafes or restaurants be a welcome improvement  After all, the array of tartan tat, cheap-as-chips fashion and even an emporium dedicated to sugary sweets ndash the smell alone could rot your teeth ndash is hardly in keeping with the magnicence of the venue.Yet given some of the poor decisions already taken by the councils planning committee, it is hard to feel confident that this incomparably lovely avenue is in safe hands. One member of the committee says the idea is to create a \"more authentic\" space. Im not sure what that means, but it sounds like double-speak for attracting lucrative footfall. And while pubs wont apparently be allowed onto the street, this relaxing of regulations extends to George Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Castle Street. Like it or not, the face of the New Towns commercial district is set for a facelt.With the demise of House of Fraser at the West End, now transformed into a whisky experience, and towards the East End the once-beloved Jenners department store due shortly to close , the heart of the city is struggling to keep up with bewildering change. Fortunately, nothing so awful is in the pipeline as the notorious proposal some years ago to build an elevated shopping mall in the gardens. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of a less stringent commercial climate is the signal it sends, and the trend it looks set to deepen.Wherever you go, Edinburgh is turning into a visitor attraction, a living museum and gallery. Useful shops for locals are a rarity. In their place is a proleration of chic cafes, glitzy on-trend eateries and luxurious hotels, all pandering to the tourist market. Thanks to the make-over of old premises and investment in new, the capital has a superficial shine, a high-cost stylish patina. But as Dickenss Mr and Mrs Veneering showed, putting your faith in appearances is risky. Yes, it creates jobs, though mostly of a lowly-paid, transitory kind. But at what cost  Do people make the trip to Edinburgh for its pubs and coffee shops, or to soak up the atmosphere of culture, history and daily le that, over centuries, have made its name Princes Street has undoubtedly been in need of improving its image for a long time now. Some initiatives are to be welcomed, such as the Quaich project, to renovate the run-down Ross Bandstand, and to \"wild\" the western part of the gardens, so they look less like a postcard from the s and rather more invitingly freeform. While that is a laudable aspiration for one side of the street, however, the other is in danger of losing whatever soul it has left.I understand that the council is in a dficult position, trying to safe-guard the future of a district caught in the retail nightmare of swtly changing, quixotic customer behaviour. That it is hoping to welcome a greater ersity of trade suggests that in one aspect at least, human habits are unchanged: eating and drinking and watching the world go by. In fact, we are consuming far more than we ever did before, willing to spend money as well as countless hours sipping lattes and beer and scoffing burgers and sushi. So much for austerity. When it comes to leisure, wallets fly open.There would be nothing wrong with broadening Princes Streets commercial scopeyou could trust those at the controls. Sadly, I have no such faith. On the evidence of recent years, the citys development is geared towards immediate gratication, mainly for migrating flocks of cash-splashing customers. Where is the long-term perspective, tailored to the true character of the city, and to the requirements and concerns of those who live in it  Why bother to ask. Such a perspective requires serious thought, knowledge and imagination, luxuries the current decision-makers dont want to afford.

We have a sensory garden, and a recently planted orchard with ieties of Scottish fruit trees.ldquoIt is beyond belief that anyone would recommend covering that in concrete and parking cars on it, in this day and age.ldquoIt seems a very strange thing for East Renfrewshire to be contemplating in the year when Glasgow is playing host to the COP  UN Climate Change Conference.\"We hope the council will see sense and reject this absurd proposal.Two of the four main options proposed by the councilrsquos consultants involve the demolition and relocation of the council offices, as part of a plan to upgrade the sports centre and theatre, and make cosmetic improvements to the approach to the school, which a report says is lsquodominatedrsquo by existing car parking.Consultants suggest the total project will involve construction costs of between pound and pound million.All but one of the options to be presented to councillors involve demolishing the allotment site - which was set up with council backing just seven years ago - to make way for a pound.m car park for teachers.The report merely says the allotments do not ldquoadd value to the park.The planners suggest they could be moved to a nearby sports pitch currently used by the school.Were the site moved, the associationrsquos  plotholders would lose the results of years of effort and investment.They also point out this would also mean the waste of more than pound, of public funding which has gone into the site since it was set up in , including grants of pound, and pound, from Whitelee Windfarm Fund, pound, from the Big Lottery fund and pound, from the council.Consultants were commissioned after the councilrsquos director of Environment Andrew Cahill said a vision was being developed to create a new park with a mix of dferent land uses.In a further report to council in December, Mr Cahill said the consultantsrsquos ideas were merely options. ldquoThey are not firm recommendationshellip they are merely suggestions possibilities.ENAA members are hoping this is the case and councillors will recognise the importance of their site to the area.No one from the allotments has been consulted about any of the proposals and the committee says it has had no response to a request for the council to meet with plot-holders to discuss them.Mr Stanage added: ldquoSurely a community facility involving dozens of people in active, environmentally friendly, inclusive and welcoming activities, with a strong community spirit deserves better than that ldquoThe alternative site is much too small and schools would likely have no space either even though our lease species the inclusion of schools.ldquoBut you canrsquot just lsquomoversquo an allotment site either.

They will explore the rich history and stories associated with it, through which it became a beacon of the Enlightenment and leading centre for the arts.ldquoWe look forward to welcoming visitors, local and from all over the world, to enjoy these events and help celebrate this fantastic anniversary.The story of Greyfriars Bobby emerged in the latter half of the s after he became something of a local celebrity in the capital. The dog was said to be the pet of John Gray, who worked for the Edinburgh City Police as a nightwatchman, and stayed in Greyfriars Kirk for almost a decade and a half after Mr Gray died, living near his grave.The tale has gone on to inspire both books and films, and a statue of the dog at the corner of Candlemaker Row and the George IV Bridge, remains a popular visitor spot for tourists.The graveyard is also a place of pilgrimage for Harry Potter fans, after author JK Rowling revealed that some of the names on the gravestones had filtered into her novels, while the setting also resembles the cemete ry where the boy wizardrsquos parents are buried.Besides its active congregations, worshipping in Gaelic and English, the kirk contributes to a flourishing local community in central Edinburgh through creating communities of support, social enterprise and wellbeing at the Grassmarket Community Project and the Greyfriars Charteris Centre.The church has links to the Covenantersrsquo early days as the defenders of Presbyterianism against any encroaches by the Catholic faith during the turbulent s. The original ldquocovenant establishing this intent was signed at Greyfriars Kirk in .Inspired by renowned figures from the Enlightenment who lie in the Kirkyard, or who were ministers of Greyfriars, a Festival of Science, Wisdom and Faith will be held between - June featuringa line-up including forensic anthropologist Dame Sue Black and writer Richard Holloway.A series of talks and  will encourage the public to reflect on the tension that has often existed between science, wisdom and faith and whether this has changed in the modern era. A new book by local historian Roy Pinkerton has been launched to coincide with the  years exploring the history of the  churches, which have united to form the present-day Greyfriars congregation.In September there will be a spectacular flower festival which will see the building filled with colourful displays paying tribute to the rich history of the  churches.Musical highlights include a performance of the Renaissance masterpiece Spem in Alium by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra Chorus, led by the conductor Gregory Batsleer on  February.During Lent, in a joint concert, the Dunedin Consort and Scottish Ensemble will perform Sir James Macmillanrsquos Seven Last Words from the Cross on March .Edinburgh Royal Choral Union plans a special commission for choir, soloist and organ from composer Thomas LaVoy November .

Has she not noted the intendant publicity, the number of female commentators and presenters on football television, such as Gaby Logan, or indeed the number of women working in the sportsrsquo media Francke also does women a huge disservice by talking about females being ldquoforced to talk about sport. What does this entail  They go home at night and study up on the new contact laws in football  Does this also imply women have been banned from introducing their own blether subject matter into the office, that any mention of Love Island, for example, should result in being docked a half-a-dayrsquos salary Ann Franckersquos out-of-touch argument is either an exercise in self-publicity or a pathetic woke attempt to ingratiate herself with what she considers a feminist vanguard.Either is pathetic.But therersquos a bigger picture to worry about here. The gender ide is being prised further apart thanks to the insanity attacks from Twitter. There are already too many attempts to widen the gap by citing the many, many faults of men. Yes, we all know the days of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace should be ended, the sexism, the inappropriate touching, but what we donrsquot need is a ban on talking up Mo Salahrsquos incredible penalty box touch.What we donrsquot need are these endless suggestions on behaviour by people such as this Management person. Indeed, we need to cancel the phrase lsquoWe need to have a conversation.rsquo What we need is to let people breathe.And we need to assume women are perfectly capable of forming conversations, and indeed cover subject matter that involves more than the anodyne.I can recall women in our office once introducing that age-old talker lsquoHow much money would you want to sleep with so-and-so,rsquo chat, and of course it was fun ndash and revealing ndash to discover how little money was involved to get intimate with the office horrors. Would that be allowed nowadays Yes, Francke is right to urge chat based on commonality but thatrsquos simply an ideal. Herersquos the reality people talk about what is on their mind, whether itrsquos whorsquoll win the league ndash or why David Walliams feels taking his trousers down is the only way to achieve column inches.Ann Franckersquos comments will not help productivity in business. It will in fact further a schism which is not good for morale at all.

consider moving permanently and visitor numbers would rise.The cost to build a tunnel to Harris from Skye would also be cheaper in the long term as ferries would no longer have to be regularly replaced.But many islanders are understandably wary of such a scheme and actively do not want it to prevent their islands being turned into another Skye, which has been overrun with tourists in the past few years.On a recent trip to Harris, a local caterer and BB owner was bemoaning how busy he got in the summer and said the island was already too full and could only cope because the ferry

After Members of the European Parliament voted to back the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, they sang Auld Lang Syne, Robert Burns’ version of an old Scottish folk song about friendship, as a way to bid goodbye to the United Kingdom.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen quoted George Eliot, saying “Only in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love”, and told the UK that “we will always love you and we will never be far”. Guy Verhofstadt MEP, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: “It’s sad to see a nation leaving, a great nation that has given us so much: culturally, economically, politically, even its own blood, in two world wars. It’s sad to see the country leaving that liberated Europe twice.”The outpouring of goodwill was palpable and obviously genuine.: Watch: MEPs belt out Auld Lang Syne as European Parliament backs Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal: Brexit: EU flag will fly at Holyrood after Brexit, after government overturns decision of impartial parliament bodyIn contrast, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage expressed the hope that the UK’s departure would be the beginning of the end for the EU. “It’s a bad project. It isn’t just undemocratic, it’s anti-democratic,” he claimed, ignoring the fact that Britain was leaving as a result of a democratic process.The vision of the world espoused by Farage, Donald Trump and other members of what some call the alt-right and others view as the far-right is of entirely separate nations in a state of constant struggle. So Trump, the US President who puts ‘America first’, makes trade war on countries who dare to act in their own interests. After France planned a new tax on tech giants, who pay infamously little, Trump threatened vast tarfs on its goods.If the EU collapsed and populist leaders in the Trumpian mould emerged across the continent, all promising to put one over rival countries with dferent agendas, how long would it be before those trade wars turned into something more serious The EU has helped keep the peace in Europe for a letime after millions died in two horrendous world wars. And the fact that the UK and Ireland were both members meant those who were prepared to commit murder in Northern Ireland’s Troubles began to look as foolish as they were callous and brutal.There are legitimate criticisms to be made of the EU and it should take Brexit as a sign of the need for reform. But it is of profound regret that the UK is leaving and The Scotsman wishes our “auld acquaintance” all the very best.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit day what happens after january 31","story":"The UK will cease to be a member state of the EU as of pm on January . But for a short while at least, many people are unlikely to notice the dference.The UK and the EU are entering what is known as the transition period - an  month window in which an intense round of negotiations will take place, with the ultimate aim of hammering out an agreement by December .During that time the UK will remain in the Single Market and Customs Union - but will have no voting rights within the EU. There will be no British MEPs sitting in the European Parliament. The UK will not be attending any EU summits held in .Practical matters - like taking a flight to a European city, or buying and selling goods - will continue during the transition period as they did before. But that could all change by the end of the year.What stays the same • Travelling to and from the EU. • Freedom of movement• Trade between the UK and EU. What happens after December  That all depends on the complex series of negotiations that will soon begin. Make no mistake, this will not be an easy task. There is no precedent for a comprehensive international trade agreement being reached in such a short time frame.There is an option to extend the transition period - but Boris Johnson has indicated his Government has no plans to use it. If an extension is not agreed by the end of June, the December  deadline will become fixed.What needs to be negotiated • Trade. The UK and EU have both said they want a comprehensive free trade agreement signed off before December . Neither side wants to see tarfs introduced on the flow of goods. But reaching an agreement on what such a deal looks like could be dficult. • Law enforcement.• Fishing. Who gets access to UK waters  And how often • Aviation. There have already been warnings that flights could be groundeda deal on aviation is not reached by the end of .• Finance. The UKs financial sector depends on interconnection with Europe, and vice versa.Could some issues be agreed by December  at the expense of others In theory, yes. The EU has already indicated as such. But the UK Government is aiming to have everything wrapped up by the end of the year. Whether that is achievable is open to debate.“The negotiations will open on all the chapters of the negotiating mandate,” an EU official said last week.“But then at some point a decision might have to be taken about what we go ahead with before the end of the year and what continues beyond the end of the year.\"The Prime Ministers official spokesman has insisted that the government believes it will be possible to secure a good free trade agreement within the -month deadline for a transition period after the UK formally leaves the EU on  January.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nafc pair shortlisted in national lantra finals ","story":"Valentina Romano and Jimmy Dakin are in the running for the Lantra Scotland awards.Jimmy Dakin from Sanday in Orkney has been shortlisted as Aquaculture Learner of the Year.

If a situation occurs outside anticipated parameters then electronic control can be useless. Aircraft have landed in the wrong place and landed unexpectedly at Sumburgh. In such circumstance everyone is safer when the situation is within view of a live controller in the airport tower. Such a lookout may also assist aircraft in dficulties, and react tovandalism and other hazardous outbreaks.They should do away with all that glass windows in the control tower as well as all the windows in control towers all over the world as they are clearly not needed. All can be done by looking at a computer screen.Any body with any sense knows there is no requirement to look in the sky, or on the runway or at the weather to see for yourself what is going on.If HIAL are determined to go ahead with this, perhaps there should be a #trial# period, of say at least a minimum of one year.Instead of just installing all the cameras and whatever other gubbins is supposed to make this work, feeding it down the phone line and hoping for the best. Why not pull down the blinds in the tower here and give the local controllers the same monitor screens to look at as they#re intending to use remotely to operate from instead. Meanwhile, also send the data to Inverness, and have them monitor and log on how many occasions and for what duration the data received is either interrupted or of inadequate quality.If the system is as resilient as HIAL claim, they have nothing to worry about or hide, the local controllers will have no complaints about using monitors instead of looking out the window, there will have been no data interruptions to Inverness, and any deterioration in data quality will have been minimal. However,serious shortcomings are evident, a controller only needs to raise the blind to regain actual vision and immediately rescue a situation.Bosses say their communications system has been affected, and that engineers are on the scene working to remedy the situation.# Well, that#s OK then.

No film-maker has documented UK society as forensically as Ken Loach. The desperation that comes from poverty, the bad choices that often seem like the only choices available, are his stock-in-trade. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another compelling exemplar of what the man is all about.Marriedparents Ricky and Abbie did all the right things.

Now mired in debt, theyare shunted from one shabby rental to another along with surly son Seb andsmart daughter Liza Jane.Ricky’sskills are no longer in demand.

I’ll try where I can to find outanybody nearby owns the property. These places are almost always in a bad state of repair – broken windows, roofs and doors missing. “If it’s somewhere that’s been left open you’re not breaking and entering and you’re not going in to commit a crime so you can’t be prosecuted for that either. Michael likes to tell a story through the items that have been left behind“You’re going in at your own risk. If you can’t get in you write it off and move on. Like I say it’s a grey area so I prefer to keep a low profile and let my pictures speak for themselves.”Michael shares the photographs he takes via his Facebook and Instagram pages entitled Forgotten Places NI: “I respect people’s privacy andI’m ever asked to take any photos down I do it straight away.“I do it for the love of old buildings and their contents, it’s as simple as that. It’s a hobby and I don’t try to make any money from it. “I had been taking photos for my own pleasure to start with but when I showed them to other people they said I needed to share them online because they were so good. That’s why I started up Forgotten Places NI.”An old ambulance found at a derelict propertyMichael’s photographs are posted with a short description of the property but little detail about the location unless it’s somewhere that’s easily recognisable. He said he likes to keep his best finds to himself: “I know a couple of other guys who do this. There’s ones who take photographs and sell them. Mine is purely a hobby.“I’ll get messages from other people asking where I’ve been. I don’t always tell them. It’s dog eat dog. It sounds stupid because there’s nothing to gain from it. It’s one-upmanship to find somewhere that no one  has posted about.Masonic supports Charity work Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“I don’t get why people would exchange locations. I don’t see the point. It’s finding the places and not knowing what’s going to be inside that does it for me. If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"new ulster hockey kirk cup sponsorship deal to help raise funds for ni children s hospice","story":"Ahead of the final, NI Law Firm of the Year, Millar McCall Wylie, has announced a sponsorship deal with Ulster Hockey to back the competition through to the end of .Chief Operating Officer, Christopher McCandless said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be sponsoring the Kirk Cup, both this season and next.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in.

All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals.

Images from NSF’s Inouye Solar Telescope -meter solar telescope, which sits near the summit of Haleakalā volcano in Hawaiʻi, show a close-up view of the Sun’s surface including a pattern of turbulent “boiling” plasma that covers the entire Sun. They also show cell-like structures - each about the size of Texas - which are the signature of violent motions that transport heat from inside the Sun to its surface.Dr Scullion said the images were an exciting first step towards understanding the physics taking place within the Sun’s surface.“Seeing is believing. We can simulate solar activity and make predictions using data and computers, but this is the first time we have been able to see high resolution images of the activity taking place on the surface of the Sun,\" the former QUB student said.\"For the team here at Northumbria the real excitement will come in a few months’ time. Once we have a series of images taken over several weeks and months, we can use the software we have developed to track the changes taking place on the Sun’s surface. This will really allow us to look at the Sun in ways we simply haven’t been able to before now.”Professor Mihalis Mathioudakis from QUB, who led the UK consortium, said the imaging produced opens new horizons in solar physics. \"Its imaging capability allows us to study the physical processes at work in the Sun’s atmosphere at unprecedented levels of detail. We worked hard over the past few years with Belfast-based Andor Technology to develop the cameras that equip the Inouye Solar Telescope and it is highly rewarding to now see this fascinating imaging,” he said. Activity on the Sun, known as space weather, can affect systems on Earth. Magnetic eruptions on the Sun can impact air travel, disrupt satellite communications and bring down power grids, causing long-lasting blackouts and disabling technologies such as GPS. The Inouye Solar Telescope can measure and characterise the Sun’s magnetic field in more detail than ever seen before and determine the causes of potentially harmful solar activity.Better understanding the origins of potential disasters will enable governments and utilities to better prepare for inevitable future space weather events. It is expected that notication of potential impacts could occur earlier - as much as  hours ahead of time instead of the current standard, which is about  minutes. This would allow for more time to secure power grids and critical infrastructure and to put satellites into safe mode.The images were taken with cameras developed and supplied to the project by a UK consortium which is led by QUB, and involves seven other UK institutes and industry including Andor Technology, Armagh Observatory, University of Glasgow, UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Northumbria University, University of Sheffield, St. Andrews University and University of Warwick.  data-dfpadtargetingThe images are the most detailed of the Sun ever captured"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/6954a/38907831.ece/BINARY/Yvonne.jpg","title":"coronavirus wuhan like ghost city its a relief to get out says northern ireland lecturer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

not acceptable to us, and it is a basic tenet of democracy that each party has a right to determine how it uses its own mandate.“On top of Sinn Fein’s destructive agenda and policy of always putting

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Here is how the Derry players performed. O Lynch – Kicked well for much of the game on his league debut. Was punished for a short kick-out that led to a score and his unconvincing punch resulted in Leitrims goal L McGoldrick – Battled well but couldnt keep a lid on Keith Beirne but his runs forward helped drive Derry back into the game before half-time. B Rogers – Conceded possession to Shane Moran in the first-half. Faired better in the second-half with some unselfish runs forward. Caught in possession in Derrys last attack. googletag.cmd.push P McGrogan – Started off on Beirne where he struggled before moving onto Moran at the break. His interception prevented a second Leitrim goal and he got forward as the game went on. C McKaigue – Caught out of position when Leitrim hit Derry on the break early on. Led by example the first-half moved on. Won a vital - ball leading to a score and kicked his side into an interval lead. C McCluskey – Conceded a free to Darragh Rooney after McGuigans goal but overall had a sound game. Got forward when he could in the first-half and defended with courage in the second. googletag.cmd.push C Doherty – Was involved in a lot of Derrys breaks from defence including McFauls opener. On the flip side, his sloppy pass in the first-half was punished at the end of a Leitrim breakaway. G ONeill – His first outing of the season. Did a lot of spadework in Derrys battle back from five points down and was involved in Emmett Bradleys goal. C McFaul – Won the duel with Oisin McCaffrey. His appetite for possession kept Derry in the game. He kicked both the opening point and the equaliser. E Bradley – His finish for the goal was a cracker and he showed well as a kick-out option. He was central to Derrys rally in the first-half but guilty of two missed chances hed usually take. D Tallon – The Glen man played in a ball carrier role, between midfield and Ryan Bell up front. Won breaking balls and generally used the ball well. Saw a point effort carried wide by the wind in the second-half. E Duffy – Another league debutant. He played in a cluttered middle third. Wasnt involved for much of the opening quarter. Shouldve squared the ball when he went for goal and opted for a point later in the first-half. B McCarron – Started inside but didnt stay there too much. Spent much of the game bogged down in midfield but his late score was a memorable moment from his first league outing. R Bell – Didnt have the same impact as the in the McKenna Cup. Landed two points but spent a lot of time away from goal. C Bradley – Played at centre-forward but spent much of the time chasing Conor Reynolds and Jack Gilheaney back through midfield. Replaced by Shane McGuigan. SUBS S McGuigan – A hamstring concern limited him to an impact man and his goal gave Derry a second chance. N Toner – Came in for Gavin ONeill and played close to goal but not really involved much. N Keenan – Replaced Liam McGoldrick and tried to get Derry attacks going on the right wing. A Doherty – Brought for the last  minutes for a league debut. Played too far away from goal to be effective. C McWilliams – Had the chance to win the game but was blocked down by Shane Quinn and was sent off on a second booking.

Richie Mullans goal was the dference between the teams but Cormac ODoherty was also on song with  points. Here is a look at how the Derry players performed. S Kelly – Conceded a free when he lunged with his feet but an otherwise unflappable performance. Safe under the dropping ball, made an important save and his long ball led to Derrys goal. P Kelly – Started on Tim Prenter before moving across to Oisin McManus. Conceded a point from play on him but his bravery was important to Derry keeping a clean sheet. googletag.cmd.push B McGilligan – Not listed to start but he was a colossus at full-back. Made a block in either half to prevent goals, the second one coming in the frantic final seconds. D Cartin – Marked a start in his new defensive role with a fine performance that included coming out with the ball twice in front of Tim Prenter in the first-half. ALSO - Match report Derry - Down - S Cassidy – Lined out at wing-back on Danny Toner and came out on top of the battle. He was strong in the air and showed mobility when Toner interchanged across the pitch. googletag.cmd.push E McGill – The fearless Lavey man had a superb game. He was always in the right place at the right time. He never game PJ Davidson an inch and dropped deeper against the wind at half-time. C Kelly – The third of three Kelly brothers in the Derry defence. Kept Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard scoreless from play. Had a solid game and his point came in the crucial final quarter. E Cassidy – As debuts go, Cassidy couldnt have hoped for better. The early wide didnt deter him. He bounced back to score later in the game and his two vital possessions late on were beyond his years. P Cleary – Was full of running at midfield. Unseen, linking the play and always an option for Derrys defence. His first-half point was a just reward. T Brady – Left almost redundant with Kellys puck-outs landing behind him. Set-up ODoherty for a score and registered one himself when Down were on the way back before a dismissal on two bookings. C ODoherty – Right from finding his range in the warm-up to his dummy for a late score from play, he never missed a shot. Edged out by Eamon McGill for man of the match. T McHugh – Like Brady, much of the play by-passed him. Almost created a second Derry goal only for a swt interception. O McKeever – Marked a fth league appearance of his career with two points. Got the better of his tussle with John McManus. A Grant – Was a frustrated figure in the first-half and never really got into the game and was replaced at the break. R Mullan – When faced with a narrow angle and Down bodies in front of him he did well to slot home his goal. Started at midfield for the second-half and played deeper. SUBS J McGuigan – Came on at the break. Put himself about and had a few chances. Failed to grab a score on his debut but played a part in Bradys point. B Glass – Came on for Odhraacuten McKeever for the last two minutes to help plug the middle as Down battled back. S McCloskey – Replaced Paul Cleary after  minutes. Gave the pass to Thomas Brady for the point that effectively sealed Derrys win. D McCloskey – Came on in stoppage time for Richie Mullan.

I got this cold off all the little two and three year olds in nursery, not that I actually wanted it you understand. Of course I understand we can’t keep our children off nursery because of a snfle, butthey’ve a proper cold with coughs, sneezes and that yucky green stuff it means they are not well - not well enough to be in nursery. For just as I didn’t want this cold neither did they, but because a few decided to come in with their nasty cold germs, with the yucky green stuff, we’ve now all had it - thanks. googletag.cmd.push Of course, I understand this is not the children’s fault but, and sorry to say, it is down to those few parents who think ‘go to nursery however snotty and yucky you may be’. So I’m writing this article, for a few reasons, the first to say please do keep your child off nursery they aren’t well, it’s no fun for them and no fun for anyone  when they get the bug too. I know le can be hard with a sickly child, I know how much we need that break sometimes but please, please keep your bugs at home. googletag.cmd.push My next reason is to share with you some tips, ideas and thoughts that I’ve heard and used over the years to help with coughs, cold’s and sneezes, please do remember though I am not a doctor soyou decide to use one of these ideas that I’m passing along to you then do check with a pharmacist or doctor that is is okay to do this with your baby, toddler and  or child. . DO make your child wear a vest or t-shirt under their jumper. Believe me I have met a few children this winter who just wear t-shirts, and always look and feel cold, winter clothes are for winter and summer clothes for summe.!  . TEACH your toddler how to blow through their nose, yes literally show them how to blow, this makes runny noses so much easier to manage. Yes of course you have to hold the tissue for them, butthey can blow then that means less of the runny stuff.  . DO put a little vaseline around their noses when your little one has a cold - this stops their nose getting sore, but also makes it sooo much easier to wipe. . Do keep this little pot of vaseline just for their nose though. . TREAT, some people do use medicines, paracetamol, baby Sudafed etc and this is a personal choice, it’s up to you as parents. But as my mum said, ‘with medicine the cold will be there a week, without medicine it’ll be there for a week’. The medicines are designed to make your little one feel better, they won’t necessarily cure the cold. Remember you know your child best, whether this be they need a little something, or an appointment at the doctor.  . WHEN your little one goes to nursery do pack a spare outfit including socks, shoes or wellies and trousers - not for toilet accidents but because it is till nice to play outside but it can be wet or muddy and it is not nice to sit about later in damp clothes.  . HELP your two and three year olds learn how to blow their nose AND put the tissue in the bin not back in the box- it is a skill and does need practise but the sooner they learn the more comfortable they feel. . TEMPERATURE, a normal temperature in babies and children is about .C but this can y slightly. A fever is usually considered to be a temperatureof C or above’ . It is handy to have a thermometer at home for these worrying times - do ask for advice from a pharmacist about which is best to buy and easiest to use. But always be mindful of your little one’s temperaturethey are poorly - and especially mindful with babies.  . PLEASE don’t wipe their nose with kitchen roll - this can make it sore, use tissues with balm in them - yes I know they can be more expensive but bargain shops do great deals.Be careful wiping noses with wet wipes as some can sting - soft tissues and vaseline don’t! . EXTRA, sometimes people use a vapour, like Vicks, to rub onto their baby, toddler or child’s chest, or feet, these can be soothing when applied to the body but you can also get them as a humidier, or as an oil to pop in the bath - it’s up to you to choose what is right for your little one. Please do be aware that there are age restrictions on them and not all are suitable for all ages.  . DO make your child wear a coat and a hat for very cold weather and maybea scarf and glovesit’s very chilly.  . DON’T force your child to eat too muchthey are poorly, little and often is best, snotty noses can often lead to sickly tummy’s, but do make sure they are getting plenty of fluids so they do not become dehydrated, water, water and more water or failing that juice. . . EVEN though it’s cold outside and your little may be full of cold sometimes a walk in the fresh air for a short time can help - fresh air can make you feel better and help your little one sleep better too - just remember to wrap up warm.  . DO encourage your little one to eat lots of vegetables and fruit, all the time not just when they have a cold, these are full of vitamins that will help them to develop a good immune system. Fingers crossed these few little things help, good luck fighting the cold bug. Atishooooo!

I got this cold off all the little two and three year olds in nursery, not that I actually wanted it you understand. Of course I understand we can’t keep our children off nursery because of a snfle, butthey’ve a proper cold with coughs, sneezes and that yucky green stuff it means they are not well - not well enough to be in nursery. For just as I didn’t want this cold neither did they, but because a few decided to come in with their nasty cold germs, with the yucky green stuff, we’ve now all had it - thanks. googletag.cmd.push Of course, I understand this is not the children’s fault but, and sorry to say, it is down to those few parents who think ‘go to nursery however snotty and yucky you may be’. So I’m writing this article, for a few reasons, the first to say please do keep your child off nursery they aren’t well, it’s no fun for them and no fun for anyone  when they get the bug too. I know le can be hard with a sickly child, I know how much we need that break sometimes but please, please keep your bugs at home. googletag.cmd.push My next reason is to share with you some tips, ideas and thoughts that I’ve heard and used over the years to help with coughs, cold’s and sneezes, please do remember though I am not a doctor soyou decide to use one of these ideas that I’m passing along to you then do check with a pharmacist or doctor that is is okay to do this with your baby, toddler and  or child. . DO make your child wear a vest or t-shirt under their jumper. Believe me I have met a few children this winter who just wear t-shirts, and always look and feel cold, winter clothes are for winter and summer clothes for summe.!  . TEACH your toddler how to blow through their nose, yes literally show them how to blow, this makes runny noses so much easier to manage. Yes of course you have to hold the tissue for them, butthey can blow then that means less of the runny stuff.  . DO put a little vaseline around their noses when your little one has a cold - this stops their nose getting sore, but also makes it sooo much easier to wipe. . Do keep this little pot of vaseline just for their nose though. . TREAT, some people do use medicines, paracetamol, baby Sudafed etc and this is a personal choice, it’s up to you as parents. But as my mum said, ‘with medicine the cold will be there a week, without medicine it’ll be there for a week’. The medicines are designed to make your little one feel better, they won’t necessarily cure the cold. Remember you know your child best, whether this be they need a little something, or an appointment at the doctor.  . WHEN your little one goes to nursery do pack a spare outfit including socks, shoes or wellies and trousers - not for toilet accidents but because it is till nice to play outside but it can be wet or muddy and it is not nice to sit about later in damp clothes.  . HELP your two and three year olds learn how to blow their nose AND put the tissue in the bin not back in the box- it is a skill and does need practise but the sooner they learn the more comfortable they feel. . TEMPERATURE, a normal temperature in babies and children is about .C but this can y slightly. A fever is usually considered to be a temperatureof C or above’ . It is handy to have a thermometer at home for these worrying times - do ask for advice from a pharmacist about which is best to buy and easiest to use. But always be mindful of your little one’s temperaturethey are poorly - and especially mindful with babies.  . PLEASE don’t wipe their nose with kitchen roll - this can make it sore, use tissues with balm in them - yes I know they can be more expensive but bargain shops do great deals.Be careful wiping noses with wet wipes as some can sting - soft tissues and vaseline don’t! . EXTRA, sometimes people use a vapour, like Vicks, to rub onto their baby, toddler or child’s chest, or feet, these can be soothing when applied to the body but you can also get them as a humidier, or as an oil to pop in the bath - it’s up to you to choose what is right for your little one. Please do be aware that there are age restrictions on them and not all are suitable for all ages.  . DO make your child wear a coat and a hat for very cold weather and maybea scarf and glovesit’s very chilly.  . DON’T force your child to eat too muchthey are poorly, little and often is best, snotty noses can often lead to sickly tummy’s, but do make sure they are getting plenty of fluids so they do not become dehydrated, water, water and more water or failing that juice. . . EVEN though it’s cold outside and your little may be full of cold sometimes a walk in the fresh air for a short time can help - fresh air can make you feel better and help your little one sleep better too - just remember to wrap up warm.  . DO encourage your little one to eat lots of vegetables and fruit, all the time not just when they have a cold, these are full of vitamins that will help them to develop a good immune system. Fingers crossed these few little things help, good luck fighting the cold bug. Atishooooo!

A city that shows fantastic community spirit. The night of  December was no dferent. That was the night a group of local artists decided to give something back and did so by way of a “site specic performance” of a new drama performed on the Guildhall steps to an overwhelming audience of support. Brief Synopsis: Closed Shutters is a tragic comedy full with social commentary, spoken in a Derry voice but has a global resonance. It is a story of three homeless alcoholics, set at the mouth of Christmas and takes place over  hours in their lives.The creative decision was made to perform the piece outside, as the team wanted the story to resonate with the audience. Let them feel the cold. This is what is faced by many people on our streets nightly.  Preparations began in September, with the assembly of the creative team and rehearsals. From the very beginning, everyone involved in the production made a collective decision to waive any fees. Everyone devoted their time and energy for nothing in order to give as much back to the community as possible. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Presentation of cheques to Derry Well Woman, Foyle Food Bank and North West Methodist Mession. Call outs went out on social media asking for donations of cold weather items hats, coats, scarves, gloves, blankets, sleeping bags… the list goes on. As well as the physical items, the team set up a gofundme page to raise money. They were not expecting the response they got! In the lead up to the event, as word started to spread about what was happening, the donations began… and they didn’t stop.The team reached out to the North West Methodist Mission first and were delighted when they agreed to come on board and help out, donating pound worth of brand new sleeping bags, all to be distributed to the homeless. As well as this, they provided all of the props needed and transport on the day. By way of a thank you for their kindness, North West Methodist Mission then received  bags of cold weather gear, as well as bags of food, toys and blankets. All of which went straight to those in need. A gofundme page raised pound which, in turn, was given to the North West Methodist Mission, to repay the investment they had made in the project, plus some extra. On the day of the performance, volunteers gathered around the city centre with collection buckets, while others gathered bags of cold weather items in the Guildhall. The total raised on the night was pound, which was then split between and recently presented to two local charities who do great work within the city - Derry Well Woman and Foyle Food Bank receiving pound. JP Conaghan, director, said: “To say the support was overwhelming is an understatement. The people showed up and witnessed our gt. They humbled me to a level words cannot describe. I want to say a massive GRMA agus GRAacute MOacuteR to each and every one who donated so kindly a week before Christmas.” The team have extended a heartfelt and huge thank you to everyone who supported the project in any way, whether that be by donation or by turning up on the night and sitting through the cold and wet air to watch the performance. Fiona McLaughlin, pro- ducer, said: “We cannot thank everyone enough. We never thought we could have this much of an impact. It just goes to show you what can be donewe all give a little of our time to those less fortunate. Derry City you are beautul! Although the project may have come to an end, the homeless epidemic in our city has not. Don’t let this be the end.Andrew Doherty, writer, said: “With Small charitable acts of kindness, we as a community avoid falling into the pitfalls which are destroying our community. Together we raised pound,, and hopefully through word of mouth, social media and mediums like this, the project can continue to make a dference and the pos- sibilities are endless.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

More information will follow on when and how these two new lts will be operational but I expect that to be possible within the next few days.Cars or light vehicles which are five years old or more are eligible for a temporary exemption certicate, which will extend a vehicles MOT certicate by four months.However, four-year-old cars have never been tested and are, therefore, not eligible for the exemption.“I have instructed the DVA that they are to be focussed on testing taxis and four-year-old cars for private customers and also car dealerships in the first instance, said Mrs Mallon.I have also instructed the DVA to speak with the Federation for Small Businesses to ensure clear communication is being delivered. I have already ensured that all other customers can be covered by the issue of temporary exemption certicates.“My Department is not responsible for the clamping of vehicles, that is the DVLA. However, the DVA has communicated to the DVLA that customers unable to tax their vehicles due to this disruption should not be penalised.“I will continue to push the DVA for progress on increasing the capacity for testing, whilst ensuring that safety remains the top priority for customers and staff.”Meanwhile, Derry MLA Raymond McCartney suggested four-year-old cars could be given a one year extension to alleviatewaiting times.“Sinn Feacutein have raised the possibility of providing a one year extension on the requirement for four-year-old cars to get tested.This would free up testing lanes for taxis.“I welcome the independent investigation ordered by the Minister for Infrastructure to examine how this situation arose.“We need to get to the bottom of these problems to address the health and safety concerns of workers and drivers alike. The Minister also needs to directly address the capacity issues plaguing the DVA.“This should include exploring a similar testing regime used in the south for private cars between four and -years-old which are tested every two years - as opposed to yearly.“This could alleviate a lot of serious pressures on MOT centres. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

when he ran onto a pass from Marty McCourt to shoot past Blackwood.Forest replaced Kane with Matt McCormick and the young striker almost scored immediately, but was denied by an excellent save from Blackwood whose out-stretched leg prevented a certain goal.In the th minute McCormick did find the net after some excellent approach play from Burkowski.Moments later a superb run from Olympicrsquos Thomas Rogers almost ended with a deserved goal, but his shot flashed over the Forest crossbar.A good performance from Tollymore that resulted in a deserved win, but can they repeat the performance this weekend as consistency is whatrsquos important Best for Tollymore were James Jennings and a remarkable first half performance from Paul Devlin, but in truth it was a good team performance.Match sponsor: Diamond Patrsquos, Newcastle.Tollymore Forest Ballynahinch Olympic III NEWCASTLE LEAGUE DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 Flagship.jpg","title":"Flagship Festival of Flight set to return  ","story":"IT has been confirmed that the Festival of Flight will be ing to Newcastle in June.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos flagship tourist event will take place on Saturday, June .This festival, which comprises exciting displays both on and off the ground is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors to the resort.It has not yet been confirmedthe RAF Red Arrows display team will be taking part.The Festival of Flight is part of the councilrsquos lsquoGiant Adventuresrsquo programme of events which was announced this week.They include Wake the Giant in Warrenpoint in August, and Footsteps in the Forest in Slieve Gullion Forest Park.The Councilrsquos tourism programme will also include the DownTime Festival in Downpatrick from June -, the Strangford Lough Skfie Festival from July -August , and the Strangford Lough and the Narnia Festival in Kilbroney Park, Rostrevor, from November -.Council chairman Charlie Casey said: ldquoThese flagship festivals are key events in our programme of tourism events.ldquoWe are very pleased that the Festival of Flight, Wake the Giant and Footsteps in the Forest are all scheduled toto our district in .ldquoThese festivals act as a catalyst to inspire visitors to visit our area.

It has been downgraded to a Type II emergency unit which we believe is not sufficient. The Downe was only one of two hospitals in the past  years which had had its needs fully assessed before it was built.ldquoThere is a clearly established case for a -hour emergency service in Downpatrick operating seven days a week and nothing has happened at the Department of Health or anywhere  to suggest otherwise. Service changes were made in the past due to staffing issues, nothing .Mr McGrady also revealed that changes are planned at the Downe with surveyors visiting the hospital recently to examine where the proposed new MRI scanner will be located.He said the provision of the scanner will result in an extension being built and also open the door to allow the hospital to do so much more in terms of diagnostics and other opportunities,Campaigners also insisted at last weekrsquos meeting that space is needed to reopen  beds closed in the same week of the new Downersquos official opening in , highlighting the need for everyone mdash including politicians and Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash to work together on this particular issue and that it was time for the ldquoinjustices of the past in terms of local health care provision to be addressed.Mrs Anne Trainor highlighted the lack of investment in local hospital services in the past and said it was time that the Downe Hospital was firmly on the ldquolips of the decision makers and that the local area got its fair share of funding.Looking to the future, she saidthe Downe does become a centre of excellence for the elderly, this will pave the way for other new services to add to those already in place.She also backed calls for more beds to be provided in the Downpatrick hospital and is keen to see the local council taking an active role on health and working alongside campaigners.ldquoHealth is the single most important issue and we have been hammering home this message for years, she declared.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council needs to play a serious role in the delivery of healthcare. The former Down Council put its hands in its pocket to help the hospital campaign but its successor has been lacking in this regard.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoWe want a fully ing hospital that provides this community with the services it needs. We already have an excellent hospital and fantastic staff, but the community deserves what everyone  has.ldquoWe also need to to engage with local medical providers who are the experts.

In addition to her work with children, Laura is also keen to show her support for the work carried out by the charity.Explaining the nature of her work, Laura said that it centres around helping children deal with emotional behavioural problems through play.She has a dedicated toolkit to help which includes sand trays, miniature toys, stuffed toys, hand puppets and books containing therapeutic stories to help deliver the so-called Play  Grow project.A qualied play therapist who is registered with Play Therapy UK, Laura has been working with children since  and previously spent time working in Downpatrick where she did her voluntary placement with Action for Children based at the Ballymote Centre.She explained that the opportunity to set up her new service came about as a result of her volunteering work with Le Change Changes Lives, with her work focusing on children aged between four and .ldquoI work with children who have emotional behavioural problems, those dealing with bereavement and loss or who have separated or orced parents, Laura continued.ldquoI also work with those who have anger of anxiety issues, those who may have become withdrawn, have communication problems or have suffered forms of abuse or nightmares. I also work with those who are being bullied or who are bullies themselves.Laura, who offers a free consultation with parents, said children can release their inner feelings through play.She explained that play is a childrsquos natural medium of self expression, highlighting the number of times children ask their parents to play with them and have a chat. Laura said children feel most comfortable in this environment.ldquoAs play is what children are comfortable with, it makes sense that you would use this method to help them through a dficult time. This is particularly effective for children who cannot or who do not want to talk about their problems.ldquoThey can play out their feelings and problems anda child wants to talk to me here of course they can do that. Some children say that they do not want to talk about whatever trauma is in their lives and I say to them that is great because they do not have to.ldquoHowever, they will still express those feelings through play and may in fact not be aware that this is what they are doing. The metaphor is very powerful in the play therapy room and children can hide behind a mask to demonstrate their feelings and using a puppet is a very good example of that.Laura said her work is a method of helping children with behavioural and emotional problems to help themselves, explaining that is the children do all the work.ldquoI am just here as a facilitator, she said. ldquoPlay therapy is not always fun and sometimes the children will encounter dficult feelings. I adopt a child-centred approach where the child leads the way and the therapist follows which is non directive.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of play therapy is the element of control. For some children when something has happened in their le or environment it is a thing which they cannot control which causes trauma. When they come here, this is the one place they can come in and say lsquoright we are doing this my wayrsquo and it can take back control.Laura described play therapy is ldquonon judgemental and said children know they are in a safe environment and can express themselves in any way in which they will be accepted or who they are.She added: ldquoThe children will learn that while here they can be themselves and they will feel comfortable to be themselves.Laura can be contacted on   or via her social media page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 New.jpg","title":"New minister at Lissara church  ","story":"A NEW chapter in the history of Lissara Presbyterian Church opened last weekend with the installation of the Rev Alan Burke.A large congregation attended last Friday eveningrsquos service in Crossgar with the new minister looking forward to his time working in the area.For the past two and a half years, Mr Burke was assistant minister at the Loanends and Killead churches near Aldergrove.

Plenty of other charities out there who I will support – it has to work both ways. “Shame on you Macmillan and Cancer Research.” A spokesperson for Macmillan Cancer said that the campaign was not “aimed at encouraging people to go meat-free forever” and that they were “really disappointed” that people felt they couldn’t support their work because of the challenge.The charity’s Rachel Murphy said: “We’re very sorry this fundraising challenge has upset people in the farming community.

He looked at me straight in the eye, and said: ‘Son, I’ve got something that I need to tell you. It’s incredibly important. But I feel like I can’t go on with my le any more without actually sharing this information with you.’So we sat down at my kitchen table. We were eye to eye.He said: ‘Tim - for all of my le I have felt like a woman trapped in a man’s body.’I don’t claim to be deeply theological. I’m feet first, mouth first, brain second.Good Morning Ulster anchor Karen Patterson signs off from show for last time with radio husband Noel Thompson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Its a very odd moment in my le, where I actually stopped and I paused - and I said: God, what would you have me do in this moment And I just felt this sense of compassion. And I felt a sense of love. And I felt something inside of me say: I need you to hold his hand. I just need you to hold his hand.And that has been the defining moment in my relationship with my dad ever since.I gotta be honest with you. It’s incredibly dficult at times. There are times when I look at him and I want to punch him in the face. I want to kick him in the shins. I want to poke his eyes out.But I always come back to this thing, this heart, this desire, which is one of compassion, and the fact God said: You’ve got to hold his hand.‘HE TOLD ME HE WAS LEAVING MY MUM’He began to say that for all of his le he always felt dferent. He’d always felt like he was on the outside, like he never fitted in to any social group, and he found ways to cover that up - by being successful in business, successful in many dferent arenas and areas of le.He said: ‘I wake up every morning, I look at the mirror, and what I see doesn’t compute. What I see doesn’t make sense.’And so I got a little bit angry with him, I got a little bit frustrated with him, because he told me he was leaving my mum.I was fearful of the impact that was going to have on me as a ministry leader, as somebody engaged in le in the church, and how that would reflect on me and how that would look.I was afraid of how it was going to impact my children, who at that stage were all under the age of . What’s it going to be like for them in school  Grandad is now granny, and so on and so forth.And it was just this really really complex set of emotions, really. As a son I felt I was grieving the loss of a parent - that I was grieving the loss of my dad essentially because what I was now being presented with was what I believed to be an impostor.Now what I’d say is all of the characteristics that I admire in my dad still exist. He is incredibly generous, he is incredibly compassionate, he is incredibly loving. My dad was my hero. And my hero still exists today.And I think it’s really important for us as a church to remember those things. Whilst somebody might come and they might present themselves in a way that we think is foreign to how they should present themselves, the characteristics - the things that God put in them when they were born - have not disappeared.‘MUM THOUGHT HE COULD BE CURED’And so in my conversation with my dad and as we were unpacking stuff, I recognised and I realised that for  years my mother had been aware of the fact my dad was cross-dressing, that he had been struggling in this area of our le, and both of them together went to get some help from the NHS.When they presented themselves in front of the NHS, my mum thought they were going for a cure. What actually happened [was] the journey ended with my dad having an operation.I made an appointment to go and see the consultant that had approved my dad’s operation. And I sat down in his office, and I looked him in the eye, and I said: ‘Can you please tell me why you took my dad from me ’He said: ‘Tim, we’ve done research and we’ve seen that there’s a male portion of the brain and a female portion of the brain.And for somebody who’s struggling with gender dysphoria what has happened is what we believe medically is thatits your dad the female portion of his brain is more developed than the male portion of the brain.’ He said it’s like a cooker standing in the mirror and seeing a fridge.In the midst of all this and as I’m unpacking it, and as I’m kind of getting to grips with it and all of those things, I’m coming back to: I’ve got to hold his hand.And here’s what’s really important to remember: that just because we accept something as somebody ’s reality, it doesn’t mean that we have to approve of it...The journey for us has been one of has been one of anger, the journey for us has been one of has been one of pain.Not only have I had to minister to my dad and his point of pain, but I’ve also had to minister to my mum, and I’ve had to minister to my we, and I’ve had to minister to my children, and I’ve had to minister to my church.My mum believes that her husband was robbed. She will look at you and say: the so-and-so left me for another woman - himself! She’s just incredible and sometimes humour is just so helpful. But what I had to witness was my mum fall apart because of a decision that my dad made.Now I don’t blame my dad for that decision any more. I’m less angry with him for that decision that I was in . But the reality of it is that that decision ripped the heart of my family out.FATHER’S DAY I don’t know what to do on Father’s Day, so I run a mile.Do I send him a Father’s Day card or do I wait til Mother’s Day and send him a Mother’s Day card My dad sent me the most beautul text message.He said: ‘Hey son, I’m so proud of the father that you’ve become. I love looking at how you love your children, what your children are becoming and what they have become, and I love you so much.’And he signed it ‘dad’. So he doesn’t even know half the time what to be saying!And this is the reality of the conversation around gender dysphoria. Most of us haven’t a clue what to say.But the reality of it is this: that Jesus came full of grace and truth.I think in the church we think that there’s a ‘truth’ camp, and we gotta give them the Bible and we gotta give them the Word - and we do. It’s the mandate, the blueprint for le.But then there’s the other side where we think ‘oh we’ve just got to love one another and it’ll be ok...’. And we forget about the Biblical mandate.The reality is that Jesus came in equal measure: grace and truth...And so when we’re investing in relationships, when we’re journeying with people, when we come to that heart of compassion, and we hold hands with the broken and the lost, become full of grace and truth. And that’s the reality of my journey with my dad.•This talk was delivered by Tim last summer, and streamed online by the Evangelical Alliance.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos more crucial than ever we re-elect a Welsh Labour Government in . But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Upper Bann MLA said: “In light of the Minister of Finance’s January monitoring round on Monday, I questioned the rationale behind allocating £.m for the replacement of street lighting columns,

supplement everyday living costsBy Group ReporterTuesday, th January , : pm\"\"Parents are dipping into their kids savings to supplement day-to-day living costs, a study has found.Researchers polled , mums and dads and found one fth have borrowed money from their childrens piggy banks and accounts in order to pay their living expenses.Nearly half of those have taken cash out of their little ones savings to pay household bills, with  per cent borrowing money to cover the cost of groceries.And, ironically, more than one sixth have done so in order to cover childcare.The research was commissioned by comparethemarket as part of their latest Parentdex report on pocket moneyJody Coughlan, Money Manager, at comparethemarket said: \"Fortunately for kids, the wider squeeze on the household budget seems to have had little impact on the generous amounts parents wants to give their children.\"That said, parents do need to ensure that they are able to give their kids this pocket money, without needing to dip into it to cover wider household bills.\"The report uncovers the spending habits of British children who receive an average of £ a month, totalling £ every year and giving them the equivalent of £.billion to spend collectively.Research also found kids savings accounts are relatively healthy, with the average child having a signicant £. stashed away.In fact, one fth of children have £, sitting in their savings.It also emerged children are generating a second source of income, with four in five parents giving their offspring extra money to cover unforeseen requests such as new clothing or nights out with friends.These ad hoc requests see one fth of parents topping up pocket money once a fortnight, and more than a quarter giving these extra handouts once a month.Meanwhile, the Bank of Gran and Grandad appears to be another fruitful source of income for kids.One quarter of grandparents find themselves contributing to kids income, with two thirds giving their grandkids generous handouts as and when they see them.Unsurprisingly, children in the capital are the recipients of the highest amount of pocket money compared to anywhere  in the UK, with the average parent in London giving £ to their child each month.In contrast, children in the east of England are given £ a month while those in the south west who are given £.Fortunately, the poll also shows mums and dads are confident in their childrens ability to manage their finances effectively, with almost three quarters believing the youngsters will be well equipped to handle money as they approach adulthood.In the absence of financial education at schools, this could be down to discussions at home, with nine in  stating they have talked about money management with their children.However, parents clearly feel their children would benefit from additional teaching in schools, with four fths of those polled believing schools should do more to teach financial education.Jody Coughlan added: \"Its incredibly encouraging to see the number of parents who are willing to talk to their children about financial management from such an early age.\"Not only will this do more to prepare them for financial responsibility in the long run, but it should also help to lessen their long-term dependence on the Bank of Mum and Dad as a result!\"\"\"Most Popular.\"

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/edel1.jpg","title":"leaders in business edel doherty beyond business travel","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster BusinessEdel Doherty’s grand ambitions for her business travel firm probably should come as no surprise to those who know her – it’s a sector which she has worked in her entire le.A decade ago she founded Beyond Business Travel, a business with a £m turnover and around  staff. Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.
