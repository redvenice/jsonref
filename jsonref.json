In the meantime, Mr Bhagwati has been unable to return home as planned to support his mother who, he explained, had survived cancer and undergone a recent bone marrow transplant in Mumbai. The Passport Service explained that while the average turnaround time for first-time passport applications has recently been reduced from 40 to 35 days, in cases where parents are both non-European Economic Area residents, it can take longer. However, Mr Bhagwati explained that, anticipating his mother’s surgery, they had applied early last October, giving them what they thought would be ample lead-in time. They still cannot get any information on when the document might come through, he said, although they recently had their own passports returned. No communication “The thing that’s most frustrating for us is that there is no mode of communication or channel to reach out to,” he said. The Passport Office has been attempting to cope with large volumes of applications generally this year following lulls during Covid-19 and associated travel restrictions. Earlier this week, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said numbers had gone “off the charts” in the last three months – there were 137,000 applications to the Passport Service in January, more than 150,000 in February and over 100,000 in March.Officials rejects the term “backlog”, stating simply that as applications are processed new ones come in. However, for Mr Bhagwati and Ms Sawant, who are permanent residents for over four years and plan to apply for citizenship, the delays and lack of information continue to be a source of stress. “It has been nothing but a terrible experience for me as a new mum and it’s not something I’d want anyone else to go through,” said Ms Sawant. The couple have no family in Ireland, meaning it would be difficult for one to return to India, leaving the other alone with their infant son. This week, however, with no sign of a breakthrough, Mr Bhagwati feels he has no option but to travel alone to see his mother who remains in recovery. “I don’t know when I can go home. I don’t know when my child will see his grandparents and I don’t know when I will see my parents.” Tracker systemA spokeswoman for the Passport Service said in cases of children whose parents are not Irish citizens, “the process can sometimes take longer due to the need to ensure that all of the required supporting documentation to prove the child’s entitlement to Irish citizenship is submitted and correct. “Due to the high level of complexity with these particular applications, further documentation is often required which can add to the processing time.” The service also says its Passport Tracker system, which has experienced technical problems, is currently working. This normally allows people access an approximate issue date. “While it has not been possible to immediately update all affected applications on the tracker, this will happen automatically as these applications reach the next stage of the process,” the spokeswoman explained. Mr Bhagwati and Ms Sawant say the tracker system has not worked for them and the only repeated information they can get through online engagement is that their son’s application remains in process.

of the special forces unit is “mainly about men”, its producer has said.“SAS: Rogue Heroes” is an upcoming BBC One mini-series about the formation of the unit in the Second World War, and the show’s male-dominated cast, including Dominic West and Jack O’Connell, was chosen with historical accuracy in mind.The independent producer behind “SAS: Rogue Heroes” has said the story of the early SAS is “about men” and had to be cast appropriately, in comments which come after criticism of the BBC over historical inaccuracies in its dramas.Martin Haines, managing director of production company Kudos, said: “There is no getting away from it, it is a story mainly about men.“We were… clear, and the BBC recognised, that it wasn’t something where you could pretend that it wasn’t the case, so we sort of lent into it and celebrated it.”He said that the series’ writer, “Peaky Blinders” creator Steven Knight, was also “clear” that the SAS’s beginnings in a male-dominated warzone in North Africa should be accurately depicted on screen.Mr Haines’ comments on the decision to stick with a mainly male cast come after recurring criticism of the BBC over historical accuracy in its dramas.A 2019 BBC One adaptation of “The War of the Worlds” drew criticism for promoting a minor female character from the original HG Wells novel into the heroine of the piece, and viewers also questioned the broadcaster decision to give Victorian clerk Bob Cratchit a mixed-raced family in a 2020 version of “A Christmas Carol”.The BBC’s recent Second World War drama “World on Fire” was also criticised for being too “woke” by having a cast of characters more erse than was likely in the 1940s.Mr Haines has said that “SAS: Rogue Heroes” will reflect the lives of the early SAS servicemen, who he described on the C21 Media podcast as “tough, often very violent, men”.While the cast of the new drama is largely male, a female character played by Algerian actress Sofia Boutella has been created as a “counterpoint” to the show’s leading men.But Mr Haines said the character, a spy called Eve, is a “combination of real-life women who played pivotal roles in the espionage and security services in North Africa”.“SAS: Rogue Heroes” follows the foundation and early days of the SAS under Lieutenant-Colonel Sir David Stirling, who devised the unit in 1941 as a force that would operate behind enemy lines in North Africa, and his successor as SAS commander, Paddy Mayne.A trailer released by the BBC on Sunday shows “Sex Education” star Connor Swindells as Stirling and O’Connell as Mayne, with the pair acting in action-packed scenes filmed on location in Morocco after rigorous training to prepare for the shoot.Producer Mr Haines has revealed that cast members endured a gruelling boot camp run by “the actual SAS” before filming, saying that the unit’s regimental association embraced the series.The ordeal could await another crop of actors in future, with producers hoping to go beyond the initial six-episode run of the drama, scheduled to air late in the year.New actors could play other influential SAS figures, with Mr Haines suggesting that the series could become like “The Crown” in its historical scope and follow the story of the SAS through the decades.The unit has been involved in numerous conflicts and emergencies, seeing action in the Falklands War, and coming to global attention for their hostage-rescue raid on the Iranian embassy in London.Mr Haines said: “It goes from 1940 right up to the present day in terms of what the SAS are doing. They have been involved in every single conflict, and lots of history along the way.“That’s what we saw as a sort of landscape to play on.”He added that producers “always thought it was a multi-series franchise”, and that Mr Knight has “already planned out in his head what series three and four would be”.The series is based on the book “SAS: Rogue Heroes” by Ben Macintyre.More from NewsUkrainian businessman steps in to pay refugee hotel bills after Home Office delaysUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Russia claims footage of Bucha horrors was \u0026#39ordered\u0026#39 by the USMonday morning news briefing: Civilians executed in the streetsEasyJet cancels 200 flights as Covid causes staff shortagesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dirt doesnt matter feminist mantra really need","story":"A fun time was had by all at the Oxford Literary Festival at the weekend. I was sorry to miss the session featuring Rachael Wiseman, one of the authors of Metaphysical Animals, a book about four women who revolutionised Oxford philosophy during and after the war. The most distinguished of them was Elizabeth Anscombe, disciple of Wittgenstein, whom I used to see in my college, looking into the middle distance as if she were pondering higher things. And she almost certainly was. The gist of the book is that men and women do philosophy differently. How differently? Women, said Wiseman, were probably less argumentative. It was too much for Sir Anthony Kenny, a distinguished philosopher himself. Anscombe, he said, was probably the most argumentative person he had ever met. He should know once, she was so engaged in a discussion they were having, she followed him into the bathroom when he was in the tub and sat on the side, still talking. I went to see Sir Anthony this weekend to ask about her. I maintained she should be a feminist pin-up, since she cracked the work-life balance (though feminists would probably balk at her Catholicism). She wore trousers and chain-smoked. And she had seven children – no nannies – while continuing to philosophise, conducting discussions the day after giving birth. How did she do it? Partly by leaving her husband, Peter Geach, to mind the babies lots of the time. But mostly by adopting the dictum “dirt doesn’t matter” when it came to the housekeeping. I’m pinning that one on my kitchen wall. There’s an interesting exhibition on at the Wallace Collection, in London, about the way rococo art influenced Walt Disney and his studio. Yes, really. Apparently, Walt was much taken by Versailles when he was an ambulance driver in France in 1918, had a collection of French porcelain miniatures, and channelled Edmund Dulac’s fairy-story illustrations for Cinderella. But what really comes out is the radical distance between human animation and the computer-generated sort. There are splendid picture sequences for Cinderella, all the work of inidual artists – about half a million for one film. Compare and contrast with contemporary bland CGI images. Beauty and the Beast, a hybrid of the two techniques, was the last watchable Disney film. After that, it’s been all downhill. What, do you reckon, would Winston Churchill have made of the exciting new “happy machines” installed at No 10? You know, like you often get in public lavatories: press sad face if you’re not satisfied with the hygiene a straight face if it’s OK a smiley face if it’s all good. Can you even get your head round what Churchill, or any PM before David Cameron, would have said, back in those days when staff weren’t treated like imbeciles? It’s one of those management hacks that is actually a pretty good indicator of a dysfunctional institution. It’s like those organisations that go to great lengths to provide mental health and resilience workshops, at the same time as laying off staff. What employees would actually say, given a chance, is that if jobs were secure, if people were treated properly, if you knew who to talk to if there’s a problem, you wouldn’t need mental resilience training, or stupid happy machines.More from NewsUkrainian businessman steps in to pay refugee hotel bills after Home Office delaysUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Russia claims footage of Bucha horrors was \u0026#39ordered\u0026#39 by the USMonday morning news briefing: Civilians executed in the streetsEasyJet cancels 200 flights as Covid causes staff shortagesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"farmers reject reckless study likens harm red meat sector tobacco","story":"British farmers and scientists are embroiled in a row after a group of academics said the harms of the meat industry are comparable to those from alcohol, tobacco and fossil fuels.Such comparisons “make no sense” and are “reckless and unjustified”, farmers said. They maintain that meat can play a role in improving both human and environmental health. Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) published a first-of-its-kind study looking at how six farming organisations in the UK portray the sector. The scientists said the industry might be attempting to minimise the impact of farming in the minds of the public. Dr Kathryn Clare, lead author from LSHTM, said: “There is growing evidence to suggest that current consumption trends of red and processed meat are a threat to both human health and the health of the planet and this is increasingly being recognised in UK policy spheres. “Our findings suggest that the meat industry may be using various frames that counteract this narrative.Dr James Milner, senior author from LSHTM, added: “These findings should act as a call to action for greater scrutiny of the industry, as addressing people’s appetite for meat will be crucial to efforts to avert climate breakdown and improve public health.”The scientists said the methods employed by farming organisations were in line with a “well-thumbed playbook” used by producers of “other harmful commodities” such as alcohol, tobacco and fossil fuels, to portray their products in a more favourable light.The National Farmers’ Union was the most heavily scrutinised of the six organisations, with ten documents (four reports and six quotes) included in the peer-reviewed study, published in the journal Food Policy. “It is reckless and unjustified for this study to compare the UK livestock sector with commodities such as tobacco and fossil fuels, where there is a very strong scientific consensus about harm to human health and the environment,” Tom Bradshaw, NFU deputy president, told The . “Arguments about diet and food production are much more nuanced, complex and widely debated among scientists.“When customers purchase British red meat products they are buying sustainable, local food, often raised in areas where it is difficult to grow other foods. The same cannot always be said for some highly processed plant-based foods.”A spokesman from Hybu Cig Cymru (Meat Promotion Wales), which was not included in the study, told The : “It makes no sense to compare meat, which has been an important nutritious part of people’s diet for millions of years, with harmful products with no nutritional value, like tobacco.“It’s widely recognised that meat in moderation can be a healthy part of a balanced diet, and independent scientific studies have shown that beef and lamb reared on non-intensive farms in these islands have a far lower emissions footprint than some of the bad environmental practices elsewhere in the world.”More from NewsUkrainian businessman steps in to pay refugee hotel bills after Home Office delaysUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Russia claims footage of Bucha horrors was \u0026#39ordered\u0026#39 by the USMonday morning news briefing: Civilians executed in the streetsEasyJet cancels 200 flights as Covid causes staff shortagesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"natural history museum may have shared visitor data facebook","story":"The Natural History Museum shared visitor data with Facebook as cultural attractions “hoovered up” personal details during the pandemic, The  has learned.Publicly funded institutions like the British Museum and National Gallery can ordinarily be entered without a ticket, but online booking forms brought in during the Covid-19 crisis meant visitors had to provide names, addresses and phone numbers to secure a timed slot.Despite attractions closing their doors for much of the pandemic, they gathered millions of sets of data between them, and it is understood visitor information is used for marketing and shared with third parties, including the Government, NHS Test and Trace, and Facebook.The Natural History Museum (NHM) “hoovered up” 702,900 entries with the help of the Covid-19 booking system, according to FOI information, which reveals that some of its visitor data is shared with Meta - the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.The museum said that sample information it makes available to Meta is “pseudonymised” and used “to help us to target our advertising communications” and “identify new users likely to be interested in our content”. This practice is entirely legal.  Jim Killock, director of the online privacy campaigner the Open Rights Group, has criticised the use of ticketing systems for “hoovering up data”.He said: “The pandemic is not an excuse to collect anything and everything.“There are continued risks of drifting into a surveillance society, and cultural institutions should ensure they play no part in that.”He added that the pandemic has not licensed a “free-for-all data grab”, warning against institutions “gathering, keeping and using attendance data”.Publicly funded attractions routinely share anonymised visitor data with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, but during the pandemic they also made personal information accessible to the NHS Test and Trace.Figures ning data gathered from March 2020 to December 2021 - and the same period across 2018 and 2019 - shows an increase in the volume of data gathered by museums and galleries.  The public could ordinarily just walk into the British Museum to see its permanent collections, but a new ticketing system brought in during the pandemic led to the institution gathering 1.1 million data entries from general admission visitors.The museum’s privacy policy states that: “We carry out research and analysis on our visitors, Members and other supporters to determine the success of our public offer and programmes.”English Heritage only had advanced online booking in place for leading attractions like Stonehenge and Tintagel before the pandemic, but a new online ticketing system gathered 1.7 million data entries from visitors after being rolled out as a requirement for all sites during the Covid-19 pandemic.No data was sold by any of these institutions and all data use is within data protection rules, which are outlined in the privacy policies on their websites. More from NewsUkrainian businessman steps in to pay refugee hotel bills after Home Office delaysUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Russia claims footage of Bucha horrors was \u0026#39ordered\u0026#39 by the USMonday morning news briefing: Civilians executed in the streetsEasyJet cancels 200 flights as Covid causes staff shortagesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"putin found god","story":"It was a sodden spring day in May 2009. A small group of men trooped solemnly across a leafy cemetery in central Moscow. The priest in flowing black robes was Archimandrite (Abbot) Tikhon Shevkunov of the Sretensky Monastery. Obligingly, he held a black umbrella over his honoured guest, President Vladimir Putin.Much of the graveyard was filled with victims of the Soviet secret police, the Cheka, but it was not they he had come to see. The president was there to pay his respects to a philosopher called Ivan Ilyin, whose body had on his orders been dug up in Switzerland four years before and flown 1,400 miles to be reinterred in Moscow. He laid a bouquet of red roses before the black granite headstone and stood with Tikhon a short time, regarding the grave. Then he left.This week, across Russia, devastated families also gathered to honour the dead. They were burying young men killed fighting for Moscow in Ukraine. At one funeral witnessed by The Moscow Times, the priest spoke of the deceased, a lad in his 20s: “He fought against evil, Satanic spirits: Ukrainian Nazis, created by American multinational corporations.”The young man in the coffin was separated by 80 years from the remains of Ilyin in that Moscow cemetery, but according to the Kremlin’s increasingly strident ideological creed, the dead shared one important feature: they were part of the same God-given mission to gather up the scattered lands of mother Russia and rebuild its Christian empire.Putin doesn’t strike most of us as the pious type. He wears a £10,500 coat, reportedly owns a £500 million superyacht and is known the world over for vaguely homoerotic, topless photoshoots. He is brutal to the point of being labelled a madman or a psychopath. He spent the first 16 years of his career fulfilling a childhood ambition to work for the KGB, the secret police of a regime that persecuted Christians and preached atheism. And he is, in the words of various Western leaders and scholars, a “war criminal”.Yet somehow, this billionaire Soviet gangster has become a leader beloved by the Russian Orthodox Church, held up as an ideal by a messianic, neo-fascist movement called Eurasianism and presented by his propaganda machine as the man who will establish the Third Rome of Christendom in Russia.Western analysis, trapped in its own worldview, has tended to focus on arguments about Nato, the EU, resources or spheres of influence in the search for Putin’s rationale. But this misses that the war in Ukraine is a conflict with an overwhelmingly religious and cultural dimension, in which the Ukrainian government is cast as a malignant tool of Satanic and degenerate Western forces. The Russian takeover of this land was to be the start of a great revival of the ancient Russian civilisation, welcomed by its virtuous Slavic inhabitants, and signal a precipitous decline for the decadent, doomed West.Somehow, while most of the West wasn’t paying attention, Russia’s nostalgia for Soviet greatness merged into a longing for the imperial father-king, the tsar, and Putin duly transformed himself from a ruthless but boring state functionary into a modern approximation of the old autocrat: an infallible messenger of God in Aviators. But how did this happen, how did it help to justify a bloody invasion of Ukraine and what will happen now that the venture has stalled and Russia is teetering on the cusp of bankruptcy?Growing up poor in a dingy Leningrad tower block, Putin spent his youth chasing rats around the stairwell and dreaming of a future as a KGB strongman. He joined the secret police straight out of university, but it was not exactly a 007 existence. His first posting was in Dresden, a relative backwater in Soviet East Germany.Accounts differ as to what exactly he was doing there – grooming agents to smuggle Western technology, fostering the growth of anti-Western terrorists or more humdrum work. Whatever Putin was up to, it gave him a front row seat on the collapse of the Soviet Union. After witnessing the crumpling of East Germany’s Soviet government, he returned to St Petersburg (then Leningrad) to see the Soviet motherland succumb to the same disease.When and how he left the KGB has never been entirely clear, but Putin quickly made himself indispensable to a wide array of politicians and officials. He moved from a job working for Anatoly Sobchak, the St Petersburg deputy mayor seen at the time as a pro-democracy liberal, to a role at the Kremlin, where he won President Boris Yeltsin’s favour through mastery of his brief and zealous loyalty.But when Yeltsin passed on the reins in 2000, he handed over a country that had just been through a calamitous economic depression, during which its economy halved in size, inflation took off, the ruble was devalued and the state went bankrupt. This was to be the experience that many Russians now associate with their brief period of “democracy”.Still, Putin quickly disappointed his authoritarian fans by adopting a firmly pro-Western stance, in particular supporting the US invasion of Afghanistan after 911. Russia’s economy, buoyed by a rising oil price, recovered, and US president George W Bush declared that he had peered into Putin’s “soul” and seen a good man.Even back then, Father Tikhon was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill Orthodox priest. Rumoured to be the man who brought Putin to Christianity and hears his confessions, he was also a rising star of a new generation of conservative imperialists in the Church, who openly advocate a return to Russia’s monarchist days. “He’s a very conservative cleric with an imperial mindset,” says Lukin.One way of forgetting is to reach back beyond the Soviet era to a much older period of history. In that vein, in 2008 Father Tikhon released a documentary on the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, called The Lesson of Byzantium. The film purports to be a straightforward history of the empire, although in interviews Tikhon admitted that it is also “propaganda” aimed at giving Russians a place in history and a spiritual mission.The 70-minute film argues that Byzantium collapsed primarily because it failed to stay true to the Orthodox faith and abandoned a highly centralised model of imperial control that stamped out nationalist separatism. Instead it succumbed to the oligarchy, Italian finance and corrupting Western notions about the primacy of the inidual over the collective.Still, the empire did pass on an invaluable treasure to the Russian people: their Orthodox Christianity. “It was upon this treasure our forebears founded not banks… or pawnshops,” Tikhon preaches. “They founded Rus, the spiritual successor of Byzantium.” The “forebear” to whom he refers is, in fact, Prince Volodymyr (or Vladimir) of Kiev, a Viking ruler of a region encompassing much of modern Ukraine, who was baptised by Byzantine priests in the 10th century. Ukraine, in this reading, is simply relabelled as ancient Russia.Despite its obscure subject, Tikhon’s film was a runaway success, reportedly sparking more than 500 articles, many hours of radio and TV coverage as well as conferences and speeches. Fans of the film declared that Moscow must rediscover an ancient tsarist tradition of seeing itself as the Third Rome of Christendom.By 2013, the year before his invasion of Crimea, Putin himself took part in a state-produced follow-up film called The Second Christianisation of Rus, which positioned Russia’s post-Soviet surge of interest in Christianity as a second iteration of Volodymyr’s original conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy. The next year, in the midst of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, state TV aired a reading of an essay by Fyodor Dostoevsky chastising Slavic tribes who were ungrateful to mother Russia. In addition to being a brilliant novelist, Dostoevsky was also a committed monarchist who believed that Russia would one day reconquer the Byzantine capital Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul).In truth, according to Peter Eltsov, a professor of security studies at the US National Defence University, this obsession with Byzantium was hardly an ancient tradition: “It’s a 19th century invention.” The idea of Russia’s spiritual Byzantine roots took off in this period as an explicit bulwark against the break-up of empire, just as the notion of national identity was taking hold in Europe. As the anti-Western, monarchist philosopher Konstantin Leontiev argued: “Whether we like this Byzantine foundation or not, whether it is good or bad, it is the only secure anchor not only of Russian but of all-Slavic preservation.”In both Putin’s 2021 essay and 2022 presidential address on the invasion of Ukraine, there are clear echoes of the same strategy, appealing to an ancient religious bond between the peoples of Russia and Ukraine as a justification for war: “Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us. It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space,” Putin wrote in 2021. “Since time immemorial, the people living in the south west of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians.”The Eastern Orthodox Church, in other words, is a way to stitch the Russian Empire together.The heritage of Byzantium Rus was not the only idea to emerge in the dying days of the tsarist era with the aim of countering the appeal of the Western nation-state. Alongside a soup of conservative, religious and exceptionalist ideas of Russia, a new breed of Russian fascism was being developed. And that is where we return to our disinterred friend, Ivan Ilyin.Ilyin was a conservative philosopher exiled from communist Russia for his opposition to the Bolsheviks. He washed up in Berlin just as the new ideology of fascism was taking off in Italy and Germany. Ilyin saw in Mussolini and Hitler models for the reinvention of a new Russian tsarism, in which a strong leader could abolish the iniduality of his people and bind them into one spiritual, collective whole, free of corruption and impurities.Putin is clearly no philosopher, but of all the intellectuals in Russian history, it is Ilyin whom he quotes the most. According to the Yale historian Timothy Snyder, just as troops were being readied to invade Crimea in 2014, the Kremlin arranged for all of Russia’s senior officials and regional governors to be sent a copy of Ilyin’s Our Tasks, in which the philosopher predicts the emergence of a “national dictator” who will be “the living organ of Russia”.Today, the task of popularising this sort of messianic fascism falls to a movement called Eurasianism, propounded by a zealous supporter of Putin named Aleksandr Dugin, who appears with regularity on Russian TV screens. Russia must rediscover itself as a Eurasian civilisation, according to Dugin, which means that it must impose upon the continent a new political model that is collectivist, religious and autocratic. For this task, he maintains, conquest of the old Russian Empire is essential.Like Ilyin, Dugin casts this battle in apocalyptic and moral terms. He claims that it falls to Russia to save the world from Western degeneracy and nihilism, evidenced by phenomena like gay marriage and the transgender debate. In this, Dugin is at one with the Russian Orthodox Church.On March 6, 10 days after the invasion had begun, Patriarch Kirill gave a sermon calling the war “a metaphysical struggle”. It was essential for Russia to intervene, he said, to combat the “so-called values” offered by the West, in which “you have to have a Gay Pride parade” to be a member of the club.Putin, in his presidential address on the eve of the war, likewise blamed the West for trying “to destroy our traditional values” and replace them with “attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature”.But the hostility to Gay Pride is not just ideological. The opposition to anything seen to undermine the family, like feminism or homosexuality, is mixed up with a more worldly anxiety that Professor Eltsov believes is driving the war: demographic change.Like much of Europe, Russia is undergoing a significant demographic shift. Its Muslim population is having more babies than its Christian population and, by some projections, Russia could become a majority-Muslim country in the foreseeable future. By taking over Ukraine, using largely ethnic minority, non-Christian conscripts as cannon fodder, Eltsov says “the idea was to get a bunch – 40 million people – who are Slavs and Europeans”.In his 2008 film on Byzantium, Tikhon had explicitly linked the failure to have children and the rise of abortion to the empire’s spiritual decline and “demographic problem”. The obvious result, he noted, while showing footage of a modern Istanbul student smoking a cigarette, was that the city succumbed to Sulton Mehmed, a homosexual 21-year-old, who, in his telling, demanded the 14-year-old son of its governor as a lover immediately after his conquest.Aside from demography, the Church’s anxiety has been exacerbated further in recent years by a direct threat to its authority: a schism.In 2018, the chief patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Bartholomew I of Constantinople, decided to recognise a new, independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church. At a stroke, Ukrainian Christians were taken out from under Russian religious authority, changing an arrangement that had existed for centuries. Patriarch Kirill immediately cut all ties with Constantinople – the very seat of Byzantine Christianity from which Russia supposedly derives its entire spiritual heritage.In a letter written to fellow Orthodox churches in mid-March this year, Kirill blamed the West for the war and emphasised that “the peoples of Russia and Ukraine, who came from one Kievan baptismal font, are united by common faith, common saints and prayers, and share common historical fate”. Kirill and his fellow clerics believed that the Ukrainian government had deliberately engineered the schism, and began to push for measures to undo this calamity with increasing urgency.The Church was not the only authority feeling threatened by developments outside Russia. Putin himself moved further and further away from the liberal values he had talked about in the 1990s in response to a series of challenges. At first, he cracked down on Russia’s oligarch-owned media to avoid criticism of his mistakes, like his poor handling of the 2001 sinking of the Kursk submarine, in which 118 crewmen died, and the security services’ mismanagement of a 2002 terrorist siege in a Moscow theatre, which resulted in 170 people dying.After that, the Arab Spring and the colour revolutions spreading across Eastern Europe unsettled the aspiring dictator. Faced with the need to legitimise his rule and consolidate power, he turned to the Church and the useful hodgepodge of imperialist, autocratic ideas floating around Russian military and intellectual circles. It wasn’t long before his regime was televising footage of priests sprinkling holy water over missiles bound for Syria.Unfortunately, he appears to have spent too much time drinking his own Kool-Aid. He convinced himself that the story told about the ancient, spiritual union of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples was true. If Russia were bold enough to regather the land, the lost Russians of Kiev would soon come flocking back to the bosom of the motherland.Still, there is not yet a general sense in Russia that the war and its consequences threaten Putin’s grip on the country. Sergey Utkin, a scholar of international relations at the Russian Academy of Sciences, is one of the few Russian academics brave enough openly to state his opposition to the war. But he does not believe speaking out will change anything. Hostility to the West is too deeply embedded to dissipate and ordinary Russians will simply blame Nato for the impact of sanctions, he believes. “What’s happening is catastrophic for Russia. It’s not opposition to what’s happening, but the nature of what’s happening that will reveal it was a terrible idea,” he says.Nor are Western ideas likely to make inroads. Utkin used to call himself a liberal, but he has found “realist” models of international relations, like Samuel Huntingdon’s Clash of Civilisations, better predict the course of events. Similarly, Lukin says he is disillusioned by Western hypocrisy over Iraq and its mismanagement of Covid: “I used to be a pro-western guy but now I am very disappointed with the West… I’m thinking more and more about the China model as most suitable.”Over in the US, however, Eltsov, a native Russian who grew up in Leningrad, sees the war as a pivotal turning point not just for Putin, but for Russia as we know it. His 2019 book, The Long Telegram 2.0, argues that for all of the weird and wonderful dogmas promoted by the Kremlin, from Byzantium Rus to Eurasian fascism, at the base of it all is “absolute cynicism”. There is no truly unified Russian identity that could be held together by these ideas if the region weren’t ruled by a brutal autocrat, he argues, and sooner or later – sooner, given the impact of sanctions – he thinks Russia is likely to break up.The prospect is surely stomach-churning, I suggest, given that Moscow controls the world’s second-biggest arsenal of nukes in the world. But Eltsov points out that a similar problem was resolved after the break-up of the Soviet Union. “It’s solvable,” he says, “but it’s frightening.” The future, he believes, lies not with Putin’s new Holy Russian Empire, but with the fragmentation of Eurasia. “Russia is over,” he says. “It’s the beginning of the end.”More from NewsUkrainian businessman steps in to pay refugee hotel bills after

biggest airports.The airline blamed the problems on high levels of sickness among employees caused by Covid, with at least 222 trips axed since Friday.It said it had made efforts to offset staff shortages by rostering additional standby crew on the weekend but was forced to make additional cancellations for Sunday and Monday.A total of 62 flights scheduled for Monday have been pulled, the majority of which were announced at short notice on Saturday.An easyJet spokesperson said: As a result of the current high rates of Covid infections across Europe, like all businesses easyJet is experiencing higher than usual levels of employee sickness.We have taken action to mitigate this through the rostering of additional standby crew this weekend, however, with the current levels of sickness we have also decided to make some cancellations in advance which were focused on consolidating flights where we have multiple frequencies so customers have more options to rebook their travel, often on the same day.We have made 62 pre-emptive cancellations for flights to and from the UK for tomorrow which represents a small proportion of tomorrow\u0027s total flying programme which was planned to be more than 1,645 flights.We cancelled the majority of these yesterday.It was later confirmed to the PA news agency that at least 222 flights were cancelled across Saturday and Sunday.Some holidaymakers reported being stuck abroad with no explanation or alternative route home offered by the airline.Simon Rudkins, 50, said he was due to return from a ski trip in the Alps with his family when the airline contacted him with less than 10 hours notice saying their flight was cancelled.He told PA that his mother, who is 85 and has dementia, had joined them for the journey back.She gets very confused and she doesn\u0027t need stress, Mr Rudkins said.It comes after passengers were stuck in long queues at Heathrow Airport on Sunday morning as the Easter holidays got under way.The airport attributed the congestion to Covid checks required by destination countries and high passenger volumes.But there were also reports of staff shortages and problems with the e-gate passport checkpoints as travellers took to social media to air their frustrations, with some saying they had waited hours to take off.Other travellers said several of the automatic e-gates, staffed by Border Force and used to process passengers, were not operating properly.The Home Office confirmed there had been a technical issue with the checkpoints which has since been resolved, and said the problem had not caused queues to exceed the standard length at Heathrow.But a Heathrow spokesperson said: Due to high passenger volumes and the Covid documentation checks still required by many end destinations, Terminal 2 departures has experienced some congestion today.Our teams are supporting our airline partners to get passengers away on their journeys as quickly as possible and we apologise

Beach is known as the home of British surfing.But its arch rival and neighbour North Devon has beaten it to a coveted international designation, affording extra protection from developments and pollution that threaten its special waves.An 18.6-mile stretch of the North Devon coastline has been named a World Surfing Reserve by US non-profit Save the Waves Coalition, the first place in the UK to gain the title.The award means groups including Unesco, local charities, scientists and businesses will intervene to protect against developments that might affect the quality of the waves or surfers\u0027 access to the sea.Adam Hall, co-founder of North Devon Surfing Reserve and a lifelong surfer, said that while Cornwall might be well-known as a surfing destination, North Devon had something unique.It\u0027s not purely around what\u0027s more popular, it\u0027s more around the quality of surf, he said.North Devon is very special. Cornwall has a lot of good breaks, it\u0027s very well known, but in North Devon the way the sediment flows out of the Bristol Channel and comes up the north coast means we have very groomed and special waves.We have really special contours of the ocean floor which shape the waves into very, very good quality.One of the reasons we were recognised internationally, and perhaps Cornwall isn\u0027t, is because in such a small area you have this really erse and special set of waves. And it really does suit lots of surfing styles and choices.Traditionalist surfers are well-served by Saunton Sands, while Croyde has the best beach break in the UK which is heavy, powerful and fast, he said.The environmental designations in the area also add to its case for protection, including Unesco\u0027s biosphere scheme and a designation as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, he added.The group has worked with scientists from the University of Plymouth to examine the nature of the area\u0027s waves and how they are created.However Malcolm Bell, chief executive of Visit Cornwall, said he thought Fistral Beach\u0027s reputation as the home of British surfing was absolutely intact.He said North Devon\u0027s beaches won\u0027t beat the flexibility you\u0027ve got in Cornwall and the vast, sheer, number of surfing beaches.The more places that do surfing, the better for the sport and the better for Cornwall. It\u0027s nice for Devon to get something ahead of Cornwall, it\u0027s normally the other way around, if at all. We\u0027re quite sporting that way, he said.The two counties share a healthy rivalry, though Mr Bell admits that Devon is pretty close to perfect.I would say to anybody that Devon is the nearest place to heaven on earth and if you keep going you\u0027ll find heaven, he said.The North Devon site is also the first cold water area in the world to receive the designation. Surf in the UK is often better in the winter.There\u0027s a common misconception that it\u0027s all suntans and board shorts, but we\u0027re all wrapped up head to toe, Mr Hall said.England internationally isn\u0027t well regarded, and that\u0027s been our fault because we held some international contests in August and the travelling surfers came and went \u0027this place is rubbish\u0027.But actually they should have come in September and October, that\u0027s when the waves are great, and it is a bit cold.The group will also campaign against the release of sewage into the sea, an issue which has gained particular attention over the past couple of years.The Environment Agency tests water samples for bacteria during bathing water season, which runs from May to September, but surfers are using the water all year round, the group argues.They also plan to prevent ill-considered development which might affect the way waves break along the shoreline.This has previously happened in Madeira, where famous surf spots were damaged by coastal engineering projects in the early 2000s and in Mundaka, Spain, where surf competitions had to be cancelled for two years after a sandbar was dredged in 2003.Ben Hewitt, a local surfer and former chairman of the campaign group Surfers Against Sewage, who has been helping the group to develop its stewardship plan, said: “There are too many cases around the world where a decision to dredge a sandbar or build a coastal development has destroyed a perfect wave forever or ruined the surfing experience.More from NewsUkrainian businessman steps in to pay refugee hotel bills after Home Office delaysUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Russia claims footage of Bucha horrors was \u0026#39ordered\u0026#39 by the USMonday morning news briefing: Civilians executed in the streetsEasyJet cancels 200 flights as Covid causes staff shortagesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"downing street staff who partied","story":"Downing Street staff who partied night away before Prince Philips funeral to be finedPartygoers at No who breached Covid- lockdown rules on the eve before Prince Philips funeral are set to be financial reprimanded after widespread furyDowning Street staff who partied against Covid- lockdown rules are set to be slapped with the same fines they enforced for millions across the country Image: Getty ImagesByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |comments Downing Street staff who partied in No the night before Prince Philip ’s funeral are set to be slapped with fines.Officials and aides who held a boozy double leaving bash on April  last year have been told they will be hit with fixed penalty notes, according to the .The Partygate event triggered widespread fury when it emerged because coronavirus restrictions in force last spring forced the Queen to grieve for her husband alone at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.

The PO scandal - where the ferries firm sacked  staff and replaced them with workers on less than the UK minimum wage - has piled fresh pressure on ministers to bolster protections for staff. But there are fears a Bill aimed at beefing-up rights could be dropped from the Queen’s Speech, where the Government outlines its proposals for new legislation, on May .Trades Union Congress general secretary France O’Grady has written to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng demanding action.She warned: “If the Government ditches the Employment Bill it will be sending a green light to rogue employers to treat staff like disposable labour.  “After the scandalous events at PO, which have exposed gaping holes in UK employment law, the need for new legislation has never been clearer or more urgent. “There is no excuse for delay. If the Government breaks its promise to enhance workers’ rights working people will have been conned and betrayed. “It’s vital ministers come clean about their plans. “In the wake of PO, the Government can stand on the side of workers and legislate new protections. “Or it can side with bad bosses and abandon its long overdue Employment Bill.” The TUC said the Government had repeatedly offered assurances it would legislate for new workplace protections. GMB union general secretary Gary Smith said: To drop the Employment Bill after the disgraceful PO sackings and widespread use of revolting fire-and-rehire tactics says everything about this Governmentaposs attitude to working people.  Employment rights in our country need to be stronger, and it is simply not good enough for the Government to keep on failing in this key area. In the face of spiralling energy bills, rampant inflation, and a cost-of-living crisis, working people should be able to stand up for their rights at work and organise for better pay. Our country deserves better. A Government spokesman said: “We are committed to building a high skilled, high productivity, high wage economy that delivers on our ambition to make the UK the best place in the world to work. “This includes ensuring workers’ rights are robustly protected while also fostering a dynamic and flexible labour market.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PO CompanyTrades Union CongressGMB unionEnergy billsMinimum wagePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It was not clear whether he planned to slash existing contracts that set the price in euros or dollars, but nations fear he may start to ration energy supplies.Germany and Austria moved a step closer to gas rationing on Wednesday, after activating an emergency plan.Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds hinted the UK should follow suit, before making a a complete U-turn.He first told the BBCaposs Sunday Morning show: We should be making those plans and the Government should be preparing, not necessarily in public, for that situation, and insisted the Government should stop shopping from one authoritarian regime to the next for fossil fuels. “But let’s be clear, we’re looking at the images coming out of Ukraine right now, I don’t think we should be talking about going back to business as usual where we just buy large quantities of fossil fuels, he said. Transport Secretary Grant shapps claimed rationing energy supplies is not the route the Government wants to go down on. He told Sunday Morning: I think the summit in Europe, the Germans in particular are very exposed to Russian energy.Mr Shapps added: [The UK is] not as open to shocks directly from Russia as a result of the fact that we donapost get as much oil and gas from them as other countries.Itaposs not the route that we want to go down.  Mr Reynolds, the Shadow Business Secretary, has since rowed back on his comments. Speaking to Times Radio, he said rationing oil and gas would be a disaster for households and businesses. The fact that you’re even asking the question is an indictment of Conservative energy policy over the past decade and the fact that we still haven’t had a plan from the government even though they said it was a priority and an emergency.” The UK has pledged to ban Russian oil imports by the end of this year as Putinaposs invasion of Ukraine has shown no signs of slowing down. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the transition would give the market, businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace Russian imports - which make up % of UK demand. The Government did not make plans to reduce the UKaposs reliance on Russianaposs gas, claiming Russia only provides around % of the countryaposs gas supplies.Russia supplies around % of Germanyaposs gas. Despite the EU countries plans to prepare for rationing, it has admitted it will not be able to wean its reliance on Russia until mid-.

On Thursday all of us spent the day desperately reading gas and electric meters, photographing them from seven angles and spent two hours trying to send the numbers to a crashed website, while we screamed and family members muttered “take six deep breaths and try again” because the next day the price was going up by two million per cent. Thanks to this sense of fun from companies such as EDF and E.On, from now on we can play this jolly game every year. It can become like searching for Easter eggs, and we’ll all laugh about the time Grandma didn’t quite get her reading in on time, bless her, so she spent the next month living in the sideboard clutching guinea pigs inside her nightie to keep warm.  In a few years, it will be a festival, like Halloween. Each March  one person will dress up as the EDF man and ­children will scream “aaaaagh don’t take our heating away”. People will run from house to house looking into cupboards with a torch, then we’ll all eat raw pizzas that we cannot afford to cook to celebrate ­Meter-reading Day. This has happened becausewe don’t have an exact reading from the moment the price goes up, the energy companies can charge us for everything at a higher rate. They’ve been given a licence to do whatever they fancy. Next week it will be announced: “Due to rocketing fuel prices, energy companies can marry one person from every household” and it will be considered a great honour to hand your sister over to Scottish Power.  The Government gives advice on how to “shop around” for cheaper tarfs, as it’s our responsibility to see which of the big six suppliers are slightly less impossibly expensive than the others. It’s like the police saying: “There have been a lot of robberies in this area lately, so we’ve decided to crack down. We’ve set up an app, so you can contact all the muggers in the area and arrange which one you would like to hold you at knepoint and run off with your bank card.” Because it’s all down to you. This is why you’ll find Government websites that give advice such as: “Save money on boiling water by filling a pan, and taking it to your local crematorium to pop it on the furnace during a funeral, so you enjoy a well-earned brew.”  The only people who aren’t told by the Government how to reduce energy costs are the energy companies who set the costs. I suppose there’s no point in ordering them about as they’re completely helpless. Since  they’ve paid £billion to their shareholders, but there’s nothing they can do to stop that. Their prices and profits just keep shooting up until eventually they’ll own the universe, and creatures from other galaxies will wonder why they have a bill for £ from British Gas. So all we can do is huddle around a candle with a raw fish finger to celebrate.

But fewer than , households have someone receiving Pension Credit - leaving nearly . million having to fork out £ for a licence. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter In total, they will pay more than £m as they battle soaring inflation, council tax hikes and the energy price bombshell. Shadow Culture Secretary Lucy Powell said: “The Tory cost-of-living crisis is hitting pensioners.  “On top of rising energy bills and food prices, many will not be able to afford to keep the TV on - risking isolation and loneliness in old age.” The Tories pledged at the  election to maintain free licences for the rest of that Parliament, which was due to run for five years. But the BBC had already been handed responsibility for funding the concession from summer , under a deal agreed in .  The corporation introduced means-testing after warning that keeping licences free for all over-s would cost £million by -. Only over-s who receive Pension Credit have been eligible for free licences since August . Older people’s groups called for the leline to be restored as living standards take a battering. Silver Voices director Dennis Reed said: The Tory broken promise on free TV licences is heaping worry upon worry for older people as we try to negotiate the cost-of-living storm.  “Thousands are giving up their main connection to the world outside because they canapost afford to pay the £ fee, or flirting with fines by putting off payment. “When you canapost afford to heat and eat properly, the box has to go.” Labour peer Lord George Foulkes, who chairs Westminster’s cross-party group on ageing and older people, said: “Among the many cuts they face this is the cruellest of all.  “It will cut off poor pensioners from information and entertainment at a time when they will need it more than ever. “Ministers should hang their heads in shame having broken solemn promises.” A Government spokesman said: The BBC should be supporting people affected by its decision to stop funding free licence fees for the over-s and treat them with the utmost sensitivity. To support families in the face of rising living costs, we have frozen the cost of a licence fee for two years, are increasing the threshold in which National Insurance Contributions are made, reducing fuel duty by p per litre and providing £m through the Household Support Fund.

Image: Getty ImagesByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |commentsA Tory minister today suggested poverty statistics released in the wake of Rishi Sunakaposs spring statement that did little to help struggling families, are somewhat misleading.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he didnapost want to get Brits lost in numbers but said poverty is ided into both absolute and relative. Poverty has been measured in absolute and relative terms to give official a full and accurate picture of how much families have to live on. This does not rule out the fact that around .million Brits will be pushed into absolute poverty, including , children, as the Chancellor refused to raise benefits - which will rise at less than half inflation. On top of this, campaigners have warned the Governmentaposs decision to cut Universal Credit by £ a week will push , children back into poverty.  Even before the pandemic, around  million children were living in poverty across the UK, the charity Action for Children has noted. The north east of England has seen the most dramatic rise in child poverty in the past five years, the charity says. Speaking on Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, Mr Shapps said: I don’t want to sort of get us lost in numbers here, but poverty is ided into both absolute and relative , and sometimes the way it’s presented can be somewhat misleading to say the least.“I do not mean to in any way, shape or form underplay it because you don’t have to be an expert – you just look at the cost of living, as you mentioned, the increase in inflation… it’s very substantial. And that’s why the Chancellor’s already come forward with £ billion.” Imran Hussain, Director of Policy, Action for Children has said: Poverty destroys le chances. You cannot level up the country with millions of children in poverty so it’s vital the Government brings forward a credible plan to reduce poverty. Mr Sunakaposs £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will mostly benefit people in work. Even with a p cut in income tax from , seven out of eight workers will still be paying more tax overall by , the analysis from the Resolution Foundation think-tank found. Natalie from Hampshire, a single mum to two children told the Mirror she is worried about rising living costs and struggles to sleep at night. “As a single mum, money is tight. I don’t have a partner or anyone  to help and so the responsibility is completely on me. It can feel overwhelming and scary.” Some months are very hard and, to be honest, I don’t know how I will manage with £ less each month. The other day I turned on the kettle and could see my smart meter clocking the energy used so turned it off. Mr Shapps later admitted the Government might need to bolster support to help struggling families battle the cost-of-living crisis, as he said, “I don’t rule out the fact that we may need to do more.” Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “I feel angry at the scale of the crisis people in this country are facing and the lack of response from Government in the spring statement - and promises on announcements in the future just wonapost cut it. We have set out that windfall tax that would give households a huge amount of help, relative to what the Government are doing - up to £ for households who are most affected by energy prices.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyNational Insurance Company Ltd.Single mumpovertyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Adele Hartley wants to dispel the myths that travellers are workshy by instead showing people a glimpse into her daily routine - which is far from lazy. Posting on her TikTok account @adelehartley_, she captions the video What people think gypsy girls do every day showing a photo of a young woman watching television with a fizzy drink in one hand and a bowl of crisps on her lap.

Firstly, Adele takes a hot cloth and wipes clean her bedside cabinet and the walls. Then she moves onto the skirting boards and light switches. Next, Adele sprays furniture polish onto the wooden door before taking another cloth and polishing it until it shines. She then moves onto the radiator - for which she uses a little brush to get in between the ridges at the top.  Asshe hadnapost been thorough enough, Adele opens the window and cleans the inside of the frame - even going to theof sticking a cotton bud into the little holes to make sure everything is sparkling clean. Finally, she takes her toothbrush and a bottle of C and gets to work polishing the rest of the frame of the window, leaving no stone unturned.

One person said: I honestly have so much respect for anyone who spends their days like this I could never. Another said: God I wish I had the time to do this everyday. However, sadly many people took the opportunity to troll Adele for being part of the travelling community, and threw stereotypes at her.

He said: I wonapost take anything from the foodbank because thereaposs families that need it, thereaposs children that need it more than I do. Founder of the Beannie Street Foodbank, off Anlaby Road, Robbie Keane says he has seen a big rise in the number of pensioners having to turn to foodbanks. He said: We are seeing an awfully big increase in pensioners using the foodbank and we are very worried. These pensioners are very worried and scared. We have seen an increase in people who have never used a foodbank before. It is up by around - per cent. The prices going up at supermarkets is very scary.

Citizens Advice believes around five million people would be unable to pay their energy bills from April, even accounting for the support the Government has already announced. With energy prices set to increase again in October, this number is expected to triple as  million are forecast to be unable to pay energy bills. In addition to the  per cent increase to Ofgem’s price cap hit bills, the Resolution Foundation think tank said the number of English households in fuel stress – those spending at least  per cent of their total budgets on energy bills – will double overnight from . to five million. The foundation’s senior economist Jonathan Marshall said: “Today’s energy price cap rise will see the number of households experiencing fuel stress double to five million. Another increase in energy bills this autumn hastens the need for more immediate support, as well as a clear, long-term strategy for improving home insulation.

The mother of Baby P, who died after months of abuse, could be freed from prison after the Parole Board decided she should be released. Connelly, , was jailed at the Old Bailey in  for causing or allowing the death of her -month-old son Peter at their home in Tottenham, north London, on August  . Known publicly as Baby P, he had suffered more than  injuries - despite being on the at-risk register and receiving  visits from social workers, police officers and health professionals over eight months. Connellyaposs mum Mary O’Connor, , told The Sun : “She needs to be in jail for le, she shouldn’t be out.”She added: “She won’t have changed. To let her out for what she did  You have to be joking.”Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said he plans to appeal against the Parole Board decision.Describing the case as harrowing, Mr Raab told the Commons: In light of the Parole Boardaposs direction to release Tracey Connelly, I should inform the House that having carefully read the decision, I have decided to apply to the Parole Board to seek their reconsideration. O’Connor, who has terminal cancer, said: “I’d love to go up to him and say, ‘Don’t let her out’. She’s a b****. Peter died because of her.”Connelly, now , admitted the offence and was handed a sentence of imprisonment for public protection with a minimum term of five years. Her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen were convicted of the same offence. A series of reviews identied missed opportunities for officials to save the toddleraposs le had they reacted properly to warning signs. A Parole Board spokesman said on Wednesday: We can confirm that a  of the Parole Board has directed the release of Tracey Connelly following an oral hearing. Parole Board decisions are solely focused on what risk a prisoner could represent to the publicreleased and whether that risk is manageable in the community.  Parole reviews are undertaken thoroughly and with extreme care. Protecting the public is our number one priority. According to a parole report, at the time of her crimes Connelly, then , got into relationships quickly, used sex to help her feel better about herself and had an inability to control extreme emotions. She was also described as manipulative and lacking in empathy. Connelly was let out on licence in  but recalled to prison in  for breaching her parole conditions by developing intimate personal relationships online and inciting another resident at her accommodation to engage in inappropriate sexualised behaviour. This is her fourth parole review. The decision was meant to be made last year but was delayed to obtain more information. The Parole Board considered Connellyaposs case for a third time in  following previous reviews in  and , and refused to either release her or move her to an open prison. In , she lost an appeal against the latest Parole Board decision not to release her.Since being recalled to prison, Connelly has taken part in a very intensive treatment programme from the Ministry of Justice and the NHS over three years and is now able to work openly and honestly with professionals, the report added. The Parole Board said it was satisfied Connelly is suitable for release after hearing she is now considered to be at low risk of committing a further offence and that her probation officers and prison officials support the plan. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab was represented throughout the review and his representative confirmed that this recommendation was accepted, the report said. Connelly will be subject to restrictions on her movements, activities and who she contacts, and faces  extra licence conditions. They include living at a specied address, being supervised by probation, wearing an electronic tag, adhering to a curfew and having to disclose her relationships. Her use of the internet and a phone will be monitored and she has been told she cannot go to certain places to avoid contact with victims and to protect children.

This is notorious fraudster John Darwin who plotted with his first we Anne to swindle nearly £, – including le insurance and pensions – by faking his death in the North Sea in a canoe in . Now,  years on from an outrageous con-trick that made headlines around the world, -year-old Darwin does a spot of shopping at a store called WILCON.The former teacher and prison officer may be hoping to cash in on his crime again as his story is turned into a major ITV drama about to hit our screens – and he is writing a tell-all book about his story.We caught up with the Canoe Man in the C Pacic heat of the Philippines – a far cry from chilly Seaton Carew in County Durham where he faked his demise.The crook refused to answer questions as he hopped into a £, SUV and sped away from the Wilcon store car park in Antipolo,  miles from capital Manila. Later his Mercy, Darwinaposs -year-old second we, told us: “The book’s about his le, but it’s not yet finished. You have to wait.” It will follow her husband’s autobiography The Canoe Man: Panama and Back, which he wrote while serving three-and-a-half years in jail before his  release. Mercy is angry the four-part ITV drama The Thief, His We and the Canoe, starring Eddie Marsan as Darwin, has been made without her husband’s permission.  In real le, Darwin and Anne carried out the fraud in . He was seen paddling out from Seaton Carew beach near Hartlepool. Then Anne reported him missing while he hid in a tent down the coast. He then moved to a bedsit next door to the family home, making a door behind a wardrobe into Anne’s bedroom and growing a bushy beard as a disguise for trips into town. The couple’s grieving two sons were never aware of what had really happened. Four years later the couple headed to Panama to start a new le with their ill-gotten gains.  But they were caught after he came home to get papers from police needed for a change in Panama’s immigration laws – and gave them his real name, saying he had amnesia. At first it was hailed a miracle that the missing canoeist had somehow survived. But his lies unravelled when the Mirror ran a story under the headline “Canoe’s this in Panama ” in December , with a snap of the pair in an estate agent’s office. Both he and Anne got just over six years for obtaining cash by deception. It emerged they had staged his disappearance as part of a pension, mortgage and insurance scam to avoid bankruptcy. They were ordered to repay £,.The couple had £, of assets – £, had been repaid by . Anne orced him after  years of marriage. Now almost , miles away from the scene of his crime, le appears far rosier for Darwin, who still receives a state pension. A friend said: “John and Mercy are really happy together. He feels like he’s been given a second chance at le and he’s grabbing it with both hands.” One associate of Mercy’s said: “I have always believed John to be a rich guy. He still seems in good health.” Darwin and Mercy, who has businesses including a clothes stall, are said to own three properties in the area. The couple are understood to have met online in .

Experts at the UKHSA say itaposs too early to know whether it is more transmissible than previous strains like Delta and Omicron.

That would make it only a fraction of the tens of thousands of total cases being reported each day at the moment, The Independent has reported. The UKHSA said that initial growth rates for XE were not much dferent from BA., Wales Online reports.However, more recent data, up to March , showed a rate of nearly % above BA., which has been called aposStealthapos Omicron.

Lisa and Craig Charters announced ambitious plans to transform their Edinburgh bungalow into a Hollywood-esque city pad after Lisaaposs parents won the jackpot six years ago.But the architects plans for the £million renovation have been slammed by other residents on the street, who have formally submitted nearly  objections to the planning application, The Sun reports. Details published on the city council’s planning portal reveal there were  public comments submitted within  days. Of those,  were objections and  comments of support.  Only  consultations were made. The consultations appear to have been made to people who live in nearby properties. The couple had paid £, over the £, asking price for the three-bedroom bungalow in the trendy city borough with views of Edinburgh Castle. Their ultra modern plans would see the original single-storey building demolished and replaced with a three-storey mansion. The large house is set to feature a zinc exterior, five glass-fronted bedrooms and a driveway rising from the garden. The couple have even submitted an application to have the project featured on Grand Designs with Kevin McCloud.  Their planning agents said the building would make a “signicant statement”. A source told The Sun: “This is a pretty signicant and ambitious development. Neighbours have been notied of the plans and they have a right to have their views.” Details of why people object to the plans will not be revealed until after a decision has been made later this month.  Lisa, of Hawick, Roxburghshire, announced her engagement to Craig in  on a beach in the Bahamas.

He bonded with law graduate Amani Liaquat as they both battled terminal brain tumours. Amani was frightened she was dying. Tom kept assuring her she was not. Tragically, they both died – Armani in February and Tom last week.  But during that last year of Amani’s le, it was Tom who brought her the joy of true friendship. And when she died, Tom suffered the loss of a true friend too. Amani’s family have the comfort of knowing what a dference Tom made to her final days. The disease that killed them both was an aggressive brain cancer known as glioblastoma multorme. Tumours like it kill more children and adults than any other cancer, yet only % of research money is allocated to finding a cure.

He met so-called Canadian nurse “Esther Anderson” on a dating site and they enjoyed daily chats for  months. But the picture he was sent of “Esther” is a fake. And her cries for help and wild tales of being jailed for smuggling gold were total claptrap. Each time Esther asked for help, intelligent John transferred money from his account – even believing he would become the owner of two .kg gold bars worth £.million. John, , took out loans to give Esther £,., plus a further £, borrowed from his father. He was sent receipts for the gold. But it was entirely fictional.  John – who has an IQ of over  and a masters degree in engineering and robotics – fell for the crooks’ story after meeting Esther on dating website match. As the romance intensied over text messages and FaceTime, Esther told John she would move to Lincoln to be with him. She then asked him for £ a month for food and claimed she was desperate. John obliged and even went hungry himself to afford the gts. He tells the Sunday Mirror: “I always help people around me. I felt bad and I sent the money. “She said ‘Thank you my love and I can’t wait to come and meet you’ and things like that. “How would anyone feel when he hears affectionate words ” He was sucked in by pictures showing a smiling “Esther”.  The con took a twist when Esther said she was a volunteer and was heading to Africa to help build a children’s hospital. She would also visit her mother in Ghana before flying to see John in the UK. Just days later Esther claimed to have been jailed in Ghana for concealing the gold bars in a case. She asked John to pay a court fee to free her from jail. Then he received letters and documentation asking him to pay for the gold to be released. Esther saidhe paid officials she would give him the gold, or sell it and pay him back. But the amount demanded kept increasing. And John kept paying out to ensure the gold was released and he could get his money back. “I was expecting to get the money back when the gold was sold,” he says. “It turns out everything was a scam.” John took out four loans to release the gold and transfer it into his name. He says: “I only sent large sums of money to solicitors and police.  “I was dealing with supposedly official people. “They sent police badges and passports and everything. Esther never asked me for large amounts of money, just daily amounts for food.” He was sent a certicate from Straw P. Beachland Gold Mines Limited, which read: “This is to certy that John Rousakis, next of king [correct] Esther Anderson, is the holder of two bars of gold weighing .kg each.” A receipt in February  acknowledged £, had been paid. Another, in August that year, was for £,. With the sum borrowed by John’s father, the family ended up in £, debt. They saw nothing inand, in February , Esther disappeared. John says: “They kept it going for a year. We were talking daily. At one point I had handed over the money for the gold. They made a bank account for me. Everything was so well planned.” John came to the UK from Greece in  – three years after suffering catastrophic injuries in a car accident. He says the scam has wrecked his mental health, admitting: “I’m used to being used.” John has been awarded £, after Barclays admitted partial liability. The bank did not pay the full amount because it said the initial outgoing sums were small and did not raise concerns. It was only when a large amount was sent that Barclays admitted it had failed in its duty of care to warn John he could be victim of a scam. The money was sent to a non-UK account, making it impossible to access by Barclays. A bank spokesperson said: “This is a tragic case of a romance scam and we have every sympathy for our customer.  “The complaint has been thoroughly investigated, following which our customer chose to refer the case to the Financial Ombudsman Service and we await the conclusion of their review. “A scammer will use a iety of scenarios to target your emotions and get you to part with your money, often using a family emergency or an overseas crisis as a reason. “We encourage customers to always be vigilant and ensure they’ve taken the right steps to determine the person they are speaking to is who they say they are.” Chloe Roche, fraud team leader at CEL Solicitors, which handled John’s case, said: “The first international payment was unusual for the account. “ Barclays admitted they should have intervened. Don’t be ashamed. It happens to a lot of people. These scammers are sophisticated. They take advantage of people’s vulnerabilities and of their kindness.” Diana Fawcett, chief executive of the independent charity Victim Support, said: “Victims of romance fraud often blame themselves, but it is important to understand that this is an incredibly sophisticated crime, and that almost anyone can be targeted. “Victims may feel they have not only lost money, but also a loving partner or relationship they thought they had.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BarclaysBanksHospitalsLoveMental healthCrimeCar crashesRomance\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Danny McCubbin, , bought the house in Mussomeli, Sicily, where a aposCase  Euroapos campaign was launched to encourage foreigners to the area. The Aussie, who had been living in the UK for  years, decided the opportunity to own an overseas home at a cut down price was too good to turn down and urged others to do the same. However, the condition was that buyers had to renovate the house within three years of purchase to have complete ownership. And with labour shortages in Italy’s construction industry made the request tricky to fulfil as the chef – who has worked for Jamie Oliver’s Fteen Foundation – couldn’t find anyone to help him renovate his dream home within the time frame. He was forced to sell the property back to an estate agency after just a few months, receiving his payment back, as it was extremely dficult to find builders.Speaking to iNews, he said: “It was very dficult to find a builder and over time the house deteriorated.“By the time I did find a building company, it was double the cost to renovate it. I decided it was not worth it for me anymore.” Danny said he was disappointed, having enjoyed the quiet le in Mussomeli, a town of just , people.  However, it did not deter him as he managed to turn his hand to buying another cheap house for £,which required less work. In addition, he was able to find two construction workers to do a week of work for him, with the smaller fixes setting him back £, . This has now allowed him to settle into the home and he has now opened a community kitchen to make and deliver free meals to vulnerable families.He added: I moved here at the end of December , because I wanted to live in Italy when Brexit happened.“I’ve always wanted to live in Sicily, my parents loved the countryside. So I asked myself what was missing in Mussomeli and I came up with the idea of The Good Kitchen.”  And the labour shortage has promoted Mussomeli’s deputy to try and reduce the pressure on homeowners who are in desperate need of builders to help renovate their houses. And mayor Toti Nigrelli has since promised to alleviate the labour shortage for others hoping to purchase a cheap house at a reduced rate.  He said: “Local enterprises, which are busy with renovations until , are forced to turn down new contracts, but soon there will be an influx of new builders from abroad to help out.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Housing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Angela Boote, , aposlied repeatedlyapos as she desperately tried to cover up her crimes and avoid being brought to justice. But the net closed on the brazen criminal, who was described as a trusted and well-liked employee and had worked for her company since , the Liverpool Echo reports.She has been jailed for three years and four months after stealing a total of £, through her role at Liverpool insurance brokers Grfiths and Armour. Over the course of a number of years the mum redirected cash intended for clients to bank accounts linked to herself and her family members.  Liverpool Crown Court heard earlier this week how Boote spent the cash to fund a “lavish lestyle” of expensive holidays, clothes and jewellery. Photos on her social media accounts, which are no longer public, show herself, her husband and their daughters in far flung destinations like Aruba in the Caribbean during the three year period she was stealing money.Sarah Grfin, prosecuting, also detailed to the court how Boote took extensive steps to cover her tracks - and continued to try to con her colleagues when they started to uncover her deceit. Suspicions were first raised in September  when Boote was away on holiday. A client complained to the company that a £ refund that they were due to receive had not entered their account.  Boote’s manager began to investigate the complaint, finding the bank details on the payment did not match those provided by the client. She contacted HSBC, the bank through which the transfer was conducted, to find out who the account belonged to and copied Boote into the email. At this point, Boote ed from leave and contacted HSBC numerous times herself, saying the issue had been resolved. At every turn, she tried to cut her manager out of the exchange, not copying her in to the emails. At one point, she even replied to HSBC and tried to make it look like her manager was copied in - but with her email address spelled incorrectly. Boote’s manager continued to question what had happened to the money and Boote finally admitted that she had sent into her daughter’s account. Yet even then Boote continued to lie, using the explanation that she must have incorrectly entered her daughter’s details because they were written down on a piece of paper next to her and she had planned to send her money from her personal account. At this stage, Boote’s manager reported the issue as a major error and an investigation of Boote’s accounts began. Eventually,  fraudulent payments were discovered and Boote was sacked shortly after. Recorder David Knton QC said Boote’s criminality was characterised from the start by complex attempts to cover up her dishonesty, with  paper trails created to hide her tracks. The court heard Boote had paid back around £, from inheritance received from an aunt and was being pursued for more cash through civil courts. Lionel Greig, defending, said Boote knew she had let herself and her family down and deeply regretted her actions. She will serve  months of her sentence in prison before being eligible for release under licence.

And what a heart-breaking yet inspirational story it is. Jenni’s painful journey was unique:She was at the FA Cup semi-final in Sheffield and witnessed the horror unfold, she took a ticket for a seat, allowing Sarah, , and -year-old Vicki and her husband to stand on the terraces, and she spent the next three decades campaigning for justice. And it took a crushing toll.She said: “It was coming up to Vicki’s st in  when reality kicked in and I realised I was no longer a mum or a we. I was this person on my own and couldn’t work out where my place in the world was. “For two years I went to a very dark place. I just couldn’t cope at all. The nightmares were so bad I was frightened to go to bed. I’d dream about the sights I saw at Hillsborough and when I woke up I could still see dying people lying on my bedroom floor. It was literally a living nightmare. I never want to go back to that place.” Five years earlier, Jenni had been through the ultimate living nightmare, as she walked around Sheffield in a daze not knowingher husband and daughters survived the crush. When news of Vicki’s death was broken to her at a hospital, Jenni was told she could not see her because she was now the property of the South Yorkshire coroner.“Being told my daughter was nothing to do with me just seemed utterly surreal. The way we were treated at the mortuary was horrendous. “There wasn’t one ounce of compassion. I wonder how I coped. It must have been because the shock left me disconnected from reality.” Making the pain even harder to bear were the lies spread by police, politicians and certain media, about the events of the day. One, printed in a newspaper, cut like a kne to her heart. An unnamed policeman claimed as he tried to revive a teenage girl, some Liverpool fans shouted “throw her up here and we will **** her”.  Jenni found that utterly despicable. “It was a complete lie. I was with the fans and they were heroes that day. “How low can you go to print an unsubstantiated report about something so vile being said about a person who could have been my dying -year-old daughter  It’s beyond belief,” she said. As often happens when a couple lose children in high-profile circumstances, the strain on their relationship became unbearable and their marriage broke down. As Jenni puts it: “We were two damaged people.”She moved up to Liverpool to be close to where the girls were buried and did a degree at John Moores University in criminal justice and psychology, socialising with Sarah’s closest friends who were still at uni. She said: “It was my crazy time. Young people accepted me. They let me do what I wanted whereas my own generation was trying to give me advice. And being with Sarah’s friends allowed me to reminisce about her.” As someone who was at Hillsborough I have always suffered survivors’ guilt, but my guilt is nothing compared with Jenni’s.  “There’s guilt that it should have been me that died because I was in the stands and they stood on the terrace,” she said. “But the real sense of guilt I feel is that I was the fan who introduced the girls to the club. “Although I came from Yorkshire I’d been into Liverpool since I was . I still have days when I think ‘ only I hadn’t been a fan’. I feel terrible guilt about that.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

The cover-up shocked a woman who, with a successful businessman for a husband and a nice house in Middlesex, considered herself part of a model Middle England family. “Before Hillsborough I thought I lived in a good country,” she said. “I trusted the police and the government, then I saw first hand the corruption which went right to the very top. And I mean to the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. “It changed my whole outlook on le and it was a hard lesson to learn at a time when I was trying to cope with the grief of losing my children.”Could she ever forgive  “If the police had held their hands up right from the start and admitted what happened maybe in time I’d have found some forgiveness but I certainly could not forgive them for the lies they made up about the fans. “And I can’t accept that not a single police officer has been made accountable for what happened when an inquest found the  were all unlawfully killed. How can we have a justice system that allows that to happen  We need the Hillsborough Law, because without it every citizen in this country is in danger of falling into the same position as me.” Does she ever wonder what le would be likethat day hadn’t happened  She said: “All the time. I look at friends with grandchildren, see how it enriches their le and I do wonder. “Sometimes I daydream about the girls coming round with their partners for Sunday lunch. But I have to stop thinking about that because it’s like chasing rainbows isn’t it   “The le I thought I’d have was taken away and I’ve had to go down a completely dferent route. I think I’m a kinder person after all I’ve had to learn from the pain and suffering. “Hillsborough turned some people bitter and angry but I couldn’t live with that because I haven’t got a safety net. I’ve got lovely friends but they’ve got their own lives. “The pain is lurking all the time. I can have days when I’m positive about things and crash days when the pain makes me feel I’ve gone right back to the beginning.“But I need to live the best le I can. How can I throw it away when my daughters’ lives were takenso cruelly My girls will always walk alongside me.

Drivers often fall victim to lesser-known driving offences, especially as  has brought in a new wave of driving laws.Other than offences such as checking your phone, thereaposs a simple Highway Code rule, which can easily trip drivers up, SurreyLive reports.An AA spokesperson told Mirror Money : Drivers have a legal responsibility to maintain their vehicle in a safe and roadworthy condition.Sothe windscreen is dirty to such an extent that it’s affecting their ability to drive safely, they could be fined.  However, it’s easily rectied and easy to avoid through basic cleaning and maintenance. When driving,your vision is obscured, you’re in breach of Regulation  of the Road VehiclesRegulations . According to Annex . of the Highway Code, the rule states to take special care that lights, brakes, steering, exhaust system, seat belts, demisters, wipers, washers and any audible warning systems are all working. Lights, indicators, reflectors, and number plates must be kept clean and clear as well as windscreens and windows. Neil Greig from IAM RoadSmart said: If a dirty windscreen is stopping you from driving safely then you should expect to be caught and charged. Not having clear vision in low sun situations is a really serious issue. He added: If you don’t take a clear opportunity to keep your windscreen clean you will find the courts taking a very serious view and almost certainly increasing you sentence, fine or ban. It takes only a few minutes to wipe the screen on the inside and keeping your washer bottle topped up should be part of any basic regular car check.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mobile phonesDriving Standards AgencyHighways EnglandHighway Agency\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It makes me feel horrible. We try and find the cheapest food.\"Donna Skeffington, , has admitted she cant even afford Easter eggs due to the rise in cost of living Image: Paige OldfieldByPaige Oldfield:,  Apr |comments A grandma in one of the poorest streets in Salford has confessed she canapost even afford Easter eggs for her grandchildren - and has to borrow off her son just to help pay the bills.Donna Skeffington, , has resorted to trying to find the cheapest food in order to save money as her elderly partner needs the heating on.But due to the rising fuel costs, she has to use blankets instead of putting the heating on, Manchester Evening News reports.The grandmother of four is from Ordsall in Salford, which is the third most deprived in Greater Manchester and th most deprived local authority area in England, according to the most recent data for Indices of Multiple Deprivation.  She said: “My partner is  and he doesn’t like being cold – we have to put the heating on. We throw blankets on but he doesn’t like that,” she says. Sometimes we have to borrow off our son, he never asks for it back. “My partner has worked all his le and he has to pay for me out of his state pension for bills, for everything. It makes me feel horrible. “We’ve just got to try and cope with it. We try and find the cheapest food. We are okay for now but things could go bad very quickly. “You’ve just got to deal with it. You can’t do anything about it you can’t starve and you’ve got to have the heating on. “We’ve had to cut back on everything,” the -year-old says as she shelters from the rain. “We can’t afford to go out, we can’t afford anything. “We have kids having to go to food banks in this day and age. It’s making me feel depressed. I’ve got four grandchildren – I can’t even afford to buy them an Easter egg.” Melissa Speed, from Salford, recently had her PIPbenefit stopped. She now receives £ which has to last her a fortnight. “I’m not coping at all,” the -year-old said. “I have to go round getting food parcels. “By the time I’ve done gas and electric and bought food, I have nothing. I’m going round picking up dimps because I can’t afford my own tobacco. We go to a charity to get breakfast and dinner.” Andrew Blenkhorn, from Swinton, plans to buy his granddaughter a present from Poundland. “I’m struggling with the gas and electric, it’s gone up,” the -year-old says. “It’s this time of year, isn’t it, that all the utility bills, council tax, food and everything  is rising. “Just for arguments sake, I do a shop online. There was something the other week that was a pound, but then it had gone up to £..  “You’re having to shop around to find the cheapest food. I live on my own and can cook so I make enough meals and freeze them to save money. My bills are going up even though I’m in credit. “I feel sorry for my daughter. She’s a community health visitor and a single mum, but she has childcare costs and everything . “The prices of everything are going up. I get PIP allowance but I’m just on the cusp of going into my overdraft every money, and that’s just on basics like food and bills. It does get me down. I’ve noticed that even things on Amazon have gone up.” Salford and Eccles MP, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has called for the city’s status to be upgraded ‘urgently’. She says much of Salford is in ‘desperate need’ of regeneration. Worsley and Eccles South MP Barbara Keeley described the ‘lack of central support’ from the government for a city where constituents are having to choose between heating or eating as ‘appalling’. But the government says the system used to calculate the Index is ‘fair, robust and transparent’. They say the focus is on productivity, unemployment, skills, transport and commercial and dwelling vacancy rates when working out priority. The government last week updated its list of areas in category one - considered most in need of levelling up and first in line for funding.Places including Chorley, Wirral, Kirklees and Allerdale and Copeland, have been upgraded to category one. Rishi Sunak ’s affluent constituency Richmondshire, in Yorkshire, is also in that category.Salford, however, remains category two and is the only place in Greater Manchester not in the top category.

The Duke of York, who settled a sex abuse case with Virginia Giuffre earlier this year, was named in a separate court case this week.Andrew has been featured in evidence given to a judge overseeing a High Court financial dispute between an elderly Turkish woman and a former banker.It has now been reported that the -year-old is in line to chaperone to Queen to Epsom races in June. A source told the Sun: “He was meant to stay invisible during the Platinum Jubilee so there is no way he will be at events like Trooping the Colour.  “But the Queen needs a chaperone on all occasions at the moment due to her mobility issues and Andrew has earmarked the Derby as the one he will accompany her at. “He just doesn’t seem to understand the public outcry.” Prince Andrewaposs role in the royal family has come into question following the end of the civil suit brought by Ms Giuffre earlier this year. He made no admission of guilt but settle the case for an undisclosed sum, understood to be £m. The settlement came in the months after he ed his military titles and royal patronages to the Queen. Amid such acrimony Andrew accompanied his mother to a memorial service for Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey this week. Prince Charles and nephew Prince William are said to have made their displeasure about the role Andrew played clear to the Queen.They did not want Andrew to be the one to accompany Her Majesty into the service on Tuesday, and reportedly spoke to her more than once to raise their concerns. The Queen went ahead and her so-called favourite son was the one seen across the world helping her along the aisle at Westminster Abbey, as the service was broadcast live on the BBC.The two heirs to the throne were said to have been “shocked” and dismayed” as Andrew emerged front and centre.  A source close to the Palace told the Mirror: [Andrew] was straight out the blocks in front of the cameras when the Duke of Edinburgh died, which was seen within the family as being completely inappropriate. “Now this situation has unfolded, a fair few hold the view that he is manipulating his position for his own gains. Vanity Fairaposs Royal Editor Katie Nicholl said the Queen deliberately chose to have Andrew play such a prominent role on the day and shows the public she still aposmakes the decisionsapos. Katie Nicholl said: This was the Queenaposs way of showing two things one, that the buck stops with her, and she makes the decisions, and secondly that she believes heaposs innocent. She made the point very, very clearly.  But Charles and William were very aware of the perspective, of the optics of this. Unfortunately, this picture [of Prince Andrew escorting the Queen] has overtaken what should have been a memorial to a great man. Andrew has spent a considerable amount of time with the ailing -year-old monarch, who has suffered from a series of health problems in recent months as well as recovering from Covid.The Duke of York, who lives on the Windsor estate, has also been ever present at his mother’s Windsor Castle home after the death of her beloved husband Prince Philip, who died last April aged .

Angela Kelly held the prestigious role of the Queenaposs dresser since  and has been working for the Royal Family for more than  years.Angela released a book titled The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe which included one hilarious anecdote about an April Fools’ day gag the dresser pulled back in , MyLondon reports. She seized her opportunity for some mischief as April Foolaposs Day approached while on a royal tour in Australia. With the Queen excited to see the iconic Kookaburra bird, Kelly purchased a soft toy Kookaburra and placed in it a birdcage on the balcony outside the royal suite in Governoraposs House. The Queen caught a glimpse of the exotic bird and Kelly recalled that the Queen looked outside shouting Itaposs a Kookaburra!  Angela said: “I went to open the cage and she said loudly, ‘No! Don’t do that! It will fly away!’ Turning to her Majesty while trying to keep a straight face, I solemnly told her it was dead. She looked horried as I walked towards her with outstretched arms and as she took the bird from my hands, she realised I had been winding her up.  However, the Queen was prepared with a retort of her own that apparently left the dresser in fits of laughter. Kelly added: aposApril Fool!apos I said with a mischievous grin, and she only had two words for me, aposYouaposre sacked!apos I was laughing uncontrollably as Her Majesty turned to His Royal Highness and said aposDo you know what she has just done to me  Angela has had me!aposAngela, who is originally from Liverpool, detailed her bossaposs quit wit in the account.

Wheelie bins were laid side-by-side in a busy Birmingham street in a bid to stop other drivers pulling in.But that didnapost stop one driver, with a people carrier seen double parked next to the bins, narrowing the lanes for approaching traffic. A shocked passer-by who saw the scene in Oldfield Road, Balsall Heath, told Birmingham Live : I was walking back to my car from a funeral and I saw it on the way.The bins were flat and did not have waste in them. The white people carrier parked there next to the bins.It was double parked next to the bins. The car was sticking out into the road. The bin was placed so the lids did not open. It was ridiculous. It was taking up two spaces. There were no dropped kerbs. It was not anyoneaposs driveway. The wheelie bins were the latest in a long line of obstacles used by householders to desperately claim blink-and-youaposll-miss them on-road spaces.In March, fuming residents resorted to using rock-filled trollies to reserve parking spaces.Two trollies were seen placed facing each other outside homes in Sparkbrook, weighted down with slabs of concrete. Rocks had also been wedged behind the wheels to secure them in place.  And one driver was left stunned after finding a wheelie bin aposselfishlyapos chained to the ground to save a car parking space. Chad Miah was trying to find a parking space near his friendaposs house when he came across a wheelie bin blocking an empty parking space, when he went to move it Chad was astonished to find the bin was chained to the ground. Chadaposs friend was getting married and the only parking spot nearby had a wheelie bin anchored into the tarmac blocking anyone form using it, Birmingham Live reports.Chad tried to wrench the obstacle free of its moorings near his friendaposs property in Handsworth, Birmingham, but found it was secured with a chain and a padlock to an anchor deep in the road.Furious Chad told reporters: My mate lives opposite and he was getting married on that day. I went to move the bin, but realised the person who did this had drilled it to the ground with a bolt and hook. The bin was attached to a metal chain and had a padlock on it. They must have gone through some effort to do it, just to save a parking space. I was yanking it, but it wasnapost moving. Iaposve seen it all now. Residents have gone to extraordinary s over the years to reserve much-coveted parking spaces in front of their homes. Some have placed cones, sofas as well as council bins to make sure they have somewhere to park.

I love Roddy, he gives a sense of hope and joy that you just cling on to.Prior to the operation she wrote the doctor a note - which the surgeon still carries in his wallet - saying: Thank you for doing everything you can, andI didnapost make it in the end, thank you for trying. Itaposs not your fault. These things just happen. With the tumour successfully removed in the operation, tests later showed it was a meningioma and was non-malignant.

Frank Adozi tricked the vulnerable woman by claiming he was working on an oil rig and he had taken the wrong bank card with him. The swindler would use his ill-gotten gains to fund an exotic lestyle, buying designer clothes, a high-end Range Rover and large amounts of jewellery.The -year-old used a fake profile on a dating website and presented himself as a middle-aged man called Michael McCarthy, police said. Azozi, of Sherwood, Nottingham, was jailed at the cityaposs crown court on Friday for four years after pleading guilty to  representation. One victim, who was in a vulnerable position after a recent split from her partner, was contacted and scammed out of the vast amount of money over a two-month period. In this time frame, the woman made  transactions that totalled £,. - money that she expected him toso that she could buy a house. She rumbled Adoziaposs organised operation in May  and reported him to police, saying he seemed aposniceapos and aposgenuineapos but that she was emotionally blackmailed into sending large amounts of money. Adozi was arrested after officers noticed he was a wanted fraudster during a traffic stop on January , . His mobile phone was analysed and it was found that he had targeted at least six other women, conning them out of nearly £, combined. In a witness statement, the woman revealed the depths Adozi went to in order to trick her into parting with £,. It read: He explained to me he was born in Australia and grew up in the United States. He said in  he relocated to the UK to be with his we Lisa who had now sadly died. He had a -year-old daughter Tamara who was attending a boarding school in New York. He told me he was thinking of leaving the dating site as he was worried about attracting the wrong kind of person who would just be after his money. He came across as a nice family man who was down-to-earth and genuine.Adozi was a prolic fraudster who had previously been jailed for four-and-a-half years for similar offences - he was released from prison in  but soon ed to his old ways. On his dating profile, he described himself as ft tall, from Nottingham and . He added that he had a masteraposs degree and was looking for a aposreal relationshipapos. Adozi was rumbled after making an error over flight times. He claimed he was catching a flight from Dubai to the UK but there were no flights available at the time. Det Con Carl Miller, of Nottinghamshire Policeaposs fraud investigation team, said he was pleased Adozi is now behind bars and unable to harm further women. He said: Adozi had no regard for his victims. He went to great s to build rapport and gain their trust, before fabricating stories to exploit them out of thousands. The fact that one victim lost £, - money she planned to buy a house with - makes this one of the worst romance frauds weaposve ever come across. It is also a unique case in that the fraudster operated from the UK as opposed to being based overseas. Fraudsters like Adozi target people in vulnerable situations and have no care that they may financially ruin their victims. In this case, a number of victims were identied who had not contacted police. We want to encourage all those who think theyaposve been a victim of romance fraud to not feel embarrassed or ashamed but rather report it.Romance fraud is a particularly callous offence and Nottinghamshire Police will always seek to get justice for victims.We do this because not only do fraudsters inflict financial loss on their victims, they also cause an enormous amount of emotional hurt and pain.

The simple mechanism uses litmus paper and solution to highlight that the test has worked successfully with one line, and a second red linethe virus is present in your saliva. Around one in three people with the virus don’t show symptoms, so can spread to others without knowing, according to NHS Inform. According to the Gov.uk website, lateral flow tests can be less sensitive when a person has lower levels of the virus in their system.The Government guidance states that “… even faint lines, shows the test is positive”. It adds: “Result lines may appear smudged or faint, but they are still valid results and must be reported.”So while youaposre seeing a faint second line, it is likely you are positive and currently infected with coronavirus. You should report this test result and carry out a PCR to confirm the result. Lateral Flow tests were previously available for free from the Government website and available over the counter at most pharmacies. But the scheme was scrapped by the UK Government with the change coming into effect from April . The decision to end universal free testing has been controversial, with many criticising the move. LFTs are still available for free in Scotland until the end of this month. Last week, the office of National Statistics reported that Covid infections reached a new record, with an estimated .million Brits testing positive with the virus.  The figures were up by around , from the previous week and have prompted fresh concerns after all lockdown restrictions were lted just a month earlier. Covid expert, Sir Patrick Vallance has warned that the world needs to be ready for another pandemic. He told the Royal Society Conference that another pandemic was certain and that Covid could reset and dodge all future vaccines.

Jacquie said: I got to the point where I stopped going out with him. Every time there would be something at the end of the night, an argument with a taxi driver or some kind of disagreement. On July , , their family planned a get-together at the sistersapos houses. The men of the family, including Reid, gathered at Jacquie’s house and the two sisters and their mum at Gina’s. Jacquie said: The lads were there enjoying the music, we were having a glass of wine. It was a lovely evening in both houses. Then, around midnight, after Reid bared his bum to the group, the sister’s parents decided to leave. Jacquie said: Paul saw them out to the taxi and when he appeared, it was like a dferent person had come into the room. “He was edgy, confrontational and wanted a row. He clapped his hands together and said aposright.... what the f*** is all this Black Lives Matter apos It was like, aposhere we go... Letaposs startapos. Reid continued to rant about the church, and about the singer Prince, who he was putting obscene allegations against. Gina described the situation as heated and she said: My brother Eugene left and myself, my other brother Adrian and my nephew Jack went back to my house but I could hear Jacquie next door saying aposdonapost push me.apos Jacquie questioned him on why he ruined a lovely evening. She said: He was right up to me and he was that angry there was spit coming out of his mouth and he was shouting at me. “He pushed me and heaposd never been physically violent to me before. It was a shock. I said aposdo not push meapos and he did it again. “Gina, my brother and my nephew were stood on the patio next door and they could hear me shouting. Gina refused to leave her there and she said: I went back in and said to him aposenough. Just stop. Reid grabbed Gina by her top and threw her on the sofa, punching her. Her brother Adrian pulled her to safety and her nephew Jack restrained Reid.  As things seemed to calm down, Jack released Reid but he jumped up and grabbed an ornament from the conservatory windowsill. Jacquie said: He pulled it back with his arm with such force, I shouted aposnoapos. We were in a conservatory. He was going to cause damage to something or someone. As the vase hit Ginaaposs face her vision went straight away with blood poured down her face leaving her iris was hanging from the socket on her cheek. She said: My world turned black. The rush of pain and the panic I felt holding my eye as the blood poured down my face will never leave me. I was afraid of who in my family he would harm next. Gina was taken to Wigan Royal Infirmary before being transferred to Manchester Eye Hospital for further treatment. Surgeons battled to save her eyeball, which had shrunk, and tried to save her sight. Sadly she has never been able to see out of her left eye again. In October , after three operations, doctors broke the news to Gina that her sight would never . Jacquie described the  hope of each operation as “soul destroying” at a time their dad was dying of cancer. On top of that, Gina had to cancel a trip to Australia to see her son and grandson because of the injuries.The day after the attack, Jacquie spoke to Reid and told him Gina may lose her sight. She said Reid became aggressive before packing his bags and leaving for Ireland. Jacquie said: I didnapost see him again. A -year relationship, gone. Two weeks later he gave me an houraposs notice to say he was coming to collect his stuff. There was a van outside with two lads in it waiting. “Everything he owned, Iaposd packed ready to pick up. When he got home I panicked and ran to ask a neighbour to help me bring his bags to the driveway. Everything was bagged, labelled and wrapped. That is how conditioned I was. He turned up and came to the front door. He asked for his TV, and so I gave him his TV. He asked for the Virgin boxes, and then in this order he asked for his Nutribullet, his fridge magnets and his mugs. Then after that he just said, aposhowaposs Gina apos. I said aposhow dare you apos. He didnapost show any remorse. He was cocky, right up until the sentence. How can you be like that  She was like a sister to him. Reid never once said sorry despite claiming in court he had wanted to. Gina is now beginning to rebuild her le, but she says the impact of the attack still looms large. She continued: It is simple things too. I canapost put eyeshadow on because you have to close one eye and I canapost see. Shaving under my arms is dficult.Some days I feel better but there are days when my eye hurts or it itches. I am just glad I have such a good family and good friends. I a just glad I have had those people to help me along the way. Doctors have made a coloured contact lens to improve the appearance of Ginaaposs eye, but her left eye is visibly smaller than her right. She said: I feel self-conscious and embarrassed, especially after a male colleague who saw me said, without meaning any harm, aposyou eyes were one of your best features.apos That hurt so much.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

She said: The one thing I always said was aposwhen I die they can take everything except my eyes.apos I used to have lovely, big brown eyes. Not anymore. Gina said: Iaposm glad he has got justice. Iaposm glad he will have this on his record. His aggressive, threatening, bullying behaviour is what put him in jail, while I am left with monocular vision, scarring to my face and a whole new lestyle to adjust to. Jacquie added: He presented himself as a professional. He was a good forklt instructor and people liked him, but they didnapost see this other side of him. It was laid bare in court. He was like Jekyll and Hyde.

A study by UCL three years ago revealed that for a straight couple in full time employment, the woman was five times more likely to do  hours of chores each week. Andyou feel your partner isnapost pulling their weight, it can be incredibly frustrating to get home from a long day of work to find you still have to cook dinner, iron and take the bins out. One woman who reckons her fiancé isnapost doing his bit has come up with a genius solution to make him realise how much she does around the house, Grazia reports. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Posting on Reddit, she explained: [My fiancé] was a self-admitted mama’s boy and went directly from his parents’ house to our shared home. After the pair moved in together, it wasnapost long before his untidy habits began to get on her nerves and after three weeks she confronted him. However, she claims her confused beau was struck by her accusation that heaposs messy and insisted she was mistaken. After the pair argued over the issue, the womanaposs fiancé came up with an idea to prove himself - they would split the house and each take responsibility for cleaning one half. The woman decided to take his offer literally - and got out her masking tape.  She then used the tape to ide every single room in the house right down the middle - including the fridge and the kitchen counters. After her fiancé initially suggested splitting the cleaning duties for two months, the woman decided just one was enough to prove her point. Unsurprisingly, the fiancéaposs side of the house fell into a bad state very quickly. The woman wrote: ‘Not even a week in and his half looked like a pigsty. She added she made some exceptions to her rule and cleaned the toilet and the shower throughout the month, which were technically on her fiancéaposs side. I was not about to use a filthy bathroom to make a point, she explained. The woman claimed that when the month-long experiment was up, her fiancé saw the light and couldnapost deny that she does signicantly more housework than him. She said he bought her flowers and chocolate and apologised for his behaviour - and then started learning how to be a responsible adult. And eight years on, it seems like the experiment worked wonders as the pair are still together and about to get married - with the woman describing her beau as an amazing man.

In her post, the woman, who is from the US, explained her date even had words with the waiter on the way out of the restaurant, which left her red-faced and embarrassed as she wasnapost keen on him causing a scene.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She said: My date didn’t tip after dinner because we weren’t brought enough bread. We went to a little Italian restaurant, and towards the end of dinner, he got very quiet. I asked what was up, and he said he was seeing that while we only got two pieces of bread, all the other tables were being served more. He said something about him being more attentive to these things as someone who runs a business, and it makes him wonder aposwhat’s going onapos. I just nodded along but thought he was overthinking what was probably just a simple human error. Then when the cheque came, he didn’t tip. He said, aposthey need to do betterapos and said something to the waiter on the way out. Not gonna lie, I was mortied. In the US, many people in the service industry rely on tips to make ends meet as they are not paid a reasonable base wage, so the woman was horried to see her date refuse to leave a tip.  She added: I think how people treat servers is incredibly indicative of the type of person they are. Especially considering that most restaurant staff have to live off of their tips, not wages. Not tipping at all seems like an extreme reaction to being shorted a piece of bread or two. It could have been an honest mistake, and easily remedied in a second. I had a good experience at the restaurant, and it’s not like the server was rude or anything bad happened. So, is this a red flag  Should I talk to him about it  I really like him but this has not been sitting well with me at all. Commenters on the Reddit post were in agreement with the woman that his behaviour says a lot about him, and many encouraged her to reconsider further dateshis actions put her off. One person said: Being mortied by a personaposs actions, whatever they may be, on a second date is enough to stop seeing someone. While another added: Itaposs the second date, you honestly donapost even need to take the time to confront himit makes you feel uncomfortable. At most,he asks you out again, say that people who are rude to serving staff are a huge turn off and youaposre not interested anymore, and then block him.

But one woman on Reddit has been left particularly baffled after she spent the night with a man sheaposs been dating for the past year, who then asked her the following dayshe wanted to cook a nice meal together. And while that might sound like a nice date idea, there was one big caveat - he apparently only wanted her to cook with him, and had no intention of letting her stay to actually eat the food theyaposd cooked. In her post, the woman explained: So yesterday I met with the guy I’ve been dating for the past year. During the date there was some friction, but we ended up talking it out. I slept at his place since we live in dferent cities, and the following day he asked meI wanted to cook a nice meal together.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. This is something we like to do together for fun and would make up for the s****y evening. I think he suggested this because he knows I like cooking and spending time with him, so it would make me feel better. Great! Lovely idea, I was very excited to spend some quality time cooking and eating together because we’re both foodies. So fast forward. We’re walking through the supermarket getting groceries for some elaborate -hour recipe we’re going to make. We’re walking past the veggie aisle or something when he suddenly mentions: ‘By the way, remind me to save you some food so you can have some as well.’ I’m like ‘Uh sorry what do you mean save some food ’ The woman then revealed that her date actually had some friends coming over for dinner who would be eating the food with him, and he wasnapost planning on letting her stay to eat with them. And when she was upset with the idea, her date got very irritated and blamed her for making assumptions about their dinner plans.  She added: Apparently, he has some friends coming over for dinner and I wasn’t invited to stay and actually eat the dinner. He wanted me to cook a -hour recipe with him, but failed to mention that I couldn’t participate in the eating part. I got quiet and upset because I was looking forward to spending some quality time with him eating great food and making up for a not so fun date. I also felt stupid and unimportant because of this. He got very irritated with me for ‘making assumptions that I would stay over for dinner’ and then being quiet and upset and avoidant about it when he told me I couldn’t. I told him I was actually quite upset that he didn’t tell me I couldn’t eat the dinner I would be cooking with him. He’d never asked me to stay for dinner: he’d just asked me to cook dinner with him and forgot to mention that I couldn’t stay to eat it. He got mad at me for being upset and therefore avoidant about it. I can see why it can be frustrating when I get upset, because I get very quiet and cold avoidant. I’m aware this is a problem and I’m working on it. On the other hand, I feel like he should have communicated better and maybe cared about my feelings a little more. He normally is a great person and this incident feels way out of character. The woman explained she ended up not cooking dinner with her date, and commenters on the Reddit post said she did the right thing by walking away from the situation. One said: Regardless of the type of relationship you have with him, you assumed what . per cent of people would assume in that situation: that you would be cooking a meal to share dinner together. As another added: Itaposs crazy that he thinks that would be an incorrect assumption on your part. Of course you assumed youaposd be eating with him because thataposs the normal thread of logic.

Deeply disturbing reports began emerging from the town over the weekend which the invading forces left in front of a trail of destruction.It is feared that local women and children have been raped and civilians shot mercilessly and left in the street to die.The numbers of dead in the Kyiv Oblast town are suspected to stretch into the hundreds.Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov, which leads the th Separate Motorised Rle Brigade which occupied Bucha, is the first senior military official connected to the massacre to be named.  Ukrainian reporter Evgeny Spirin said: “Some of the killed children had their arms tied up. Children…. They were tying up children. There were shot dogs. He added: “Irpen, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with this, and is it worth living at all  “How do I explain this to myself, how  They must cease to exist. “They must all be destroyed, each and every one of them, turned into dust, into mud, into clay, all of them.”Ukrainian activists and web sleuths have identied the presence of Omurbekov’s forces - which are normally based in the far east of Russia rather than Kyiv Oblast - and a number of other Russian military units.Volunteers group Tretya Sila reported: In Bucha there was a military unit  from the village of Knyaze-Volkonskoye, Khabarovsk region...  “Soon all these murderers, rapists and looters will be known by name. InformNapalm volunteers named Omurbekov as unit  of the th Separate Motorized Rle Brigade amid suspicions of grotesque war crimes in Bucha. Forces from several other groups are also suspected of being in the town, including those from the Fth Separate Guards Tank Brigade of th army of the Russian Eastern military district and the st Parachute Assault Regiment of th airborne ision. So far Omurbekov is the only commander to be named. Russian sources have denied that they are responsible for the massacre, claiming that the Ukrainian army slaughtered its own people. Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said: “The Russian defence ministry has fully rejected these  accusations.”I would like to point out that Russian troops left Bucha on March . “The Ukrainian authorities remained silent all these days, and now they have suddenly posted sensational footage in order to tarnish Russia’s image and make Russia defend itself. I would like to emphasise with full responsibility that not a single civilian suffered from violence when the town was controlled by the Russian Armed Forces. On the contrary, our troops delivered  tonnes of humanitarian aid for civilians. Meanwhile, the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the town of Bucha right after Russian troops had left was deliberately ignored in the US.  “This is what could have caused civilian casualties. That said, the Kiev regime is clearly trying to blame its atrocities on Russia.” Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed Kyiv colluded with the West in seeking to blame Russia for the massacre, which she said was a provocation staged by the Ukrainian military and radical nationalists” to disrupt peace talks.The unsupported claims from Russian officials are typical of those which have been heard throughout the invasion and clearly aim to sow doubt and ision within Ukraine and its allies. The scale of the massacre and its depraved nature has prompted a response from Western leaders, while it has been reported that Boris Johnson will seek to galvanise a tough response from allies to the crisis.On its rd anniversary, the Prime Minister will hail Nato as the greatest security alliance in the history of the world - adding that it has a responsibility to support the Ukrainian people as they fight for freedom with every fibre of their being. It comes after the PM condemned Russiaaposs despicable attacks against Ukrainian civilians in Irpin and Bucha, adding that we will not rest until justice is served. This week he will welcome the Polish and German leaders to Downing Street for discussions on Nato and how to support Ukraine as it stands up to Russian aggression. On Sunday, Mr Johnson said no denial or disinformation from the Kremlin can conceal that President Vladimir Putin is desperate and his invasion is failing. An adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said dead civilians had been found on the streets of the small city of Bucha and the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, in what resembled a horror movie.In Bucha, north-west of Kyiv, Ukrainian soldiers used cables to drag bodies off a street - from a distance due to fears they may be booby-trapped - as Russian troops withdraw and focus attacks on other parts of Ukraine. Ukraineaposs prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova said the bodies of  civilians have been found in Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. In a statement, Mr Johnson said the UK was stepping up its sanctions and military support, and bolstering humanitarian help for those on the ground. He added: The UK has been at the forefront of supporting the International Criminal Courtapossinvestigation into atrocities committed in Ukraine.  The Justice Secretary has authorised additional financial support and the deployment of specialist investigators - we will not rest until justice is served.Earlier on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said indiscriminate attacks by Russian forces against innocent civilians in Irpin and Bucha must be investigated as war crimes.Ms Truss said the UK would not rest until those responsible for atrocities in Ukraine had faced justice, adding that Russia would not be allowed to cover up its involvement through cynical disinformation. Mr Zelenskyaposs spokesman Sergey Nikorov said authorities in Ukraine had found what looked exactly like war crimes, including the bodies of executed civilians and mass graves.

The ministry’s information agency tweeting today: Whiletrying to leave Mariupol, Russian occupiers killed Lithuanian director Mantas Kvedaravicius”.Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said: We lost a creator well known in Lithuania and in the whole world who, until the very last moment, in spite of danger, worked in Russia-occupied Ukraine.”The -year-old was best known for his conflict-zone documentary Mariupolis, which premiered in  at the Berlin International Film Festival.  It showed a city, a strategic port in a mostly Russian-speaking part of eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists have clashed with Ukrainian forces since .Mariupol was one of the main targets of Russia ’s invasion when it began on February .The city has spent weeks being bombed and reduced to rubble, with tens of thousands still trapped.Mantas Kvedaravicius, was murdered today in Mariupol, with a camera in his hands, in this s***** war of evil, against the whole world, Russian film director Vitaly Mansky, founder of the Artdocfest arts festival in which Kvedaravicius was a participant, said on Facebook.Kvedaravicius also won an award for his  film ‘Barzakh’ which was shot in the Russian region of Chechnya, where the country fought two wars to put down rebellions between  and .

Inside the terrorised city of Mariupol, civilians are almost entirely without food, water and electricity as temperatures plummet below zero at night. Many are unable to leave their shelters due to the ongoing Russian missile strikes and shelling and loved ones cannot let their family and friends outside know they’re still alive. The city has seen some of the worst Russian atrocities including the bombing of a maternity and children’s hospital, and of a theatre where thousands of innocents were sheltering. Mariupol’s residents even wrote ‘children’ in Russian outside the theatre in hope Putin’s forces would not attack it.

Cops eventually arrested the vaccine cheat when he entered another town, near to Leipzig, where he was then detained. The German Red Cross has pressed charges and suspect him of being involved in the lucrative trade in fake vaccine passports. Police in other German states have also launched investigations of their own, DPA reports.  Authorities identied  occasions the man took a jab, but itaposs thought the true number is far higher. According to reports, every time he entered the facility he would take a blank vaccination form with him, and then resell the part of the document detailing batch numbers to anti-vaxxers.

The move is eerily similar to tactics employed by Soviet-era dictators like Joseph Stalin and his secret police, the NKVD. A telephone hotline and website have been set up that allow “good citizens” to report “traitors”. The Kremlin has reportedly sent Russian citizens in several regions texts with instructions how to report one another, with outspoken voices being tossed into jail. Any Russian wishing to rat out their fellow citizen can also use a dedicated channel on the social media .  This led to a young -year-old shop assistant spending  hours in a cell this week after they told a stranger in Moscow that she disagreed with the war in Ukraine.The woman told the Sunday : aposIt was just a chit chat...he got very upset that we didnapost share his opinion and started arguing, saying that Putin and the war were absolutely right.” The man was thrown out the bar but within an hour police arrived and asked the woman and her friends.

She was tossed in a cell overnight and fined for “discrediting Russian armed forces”, she said.Alongside that, at a school in Penza, central Russia, pupils ratted out their own teacher after they secretly recorded her making anti-war comments..  Other Russians reported on the hotline include a Siberian woman who decorated her tree yellow and blue, the colours of the Ukrainian flag, a man in Moscow who hung a Ukrainian flag from his window, and a police officer who was overheard criticising the invasion. The accounts have been collected by Russian human rights group OVD-Info. Head of the groupaposs legal department Alexandra Baeva said: “In Russia now, it is like : people are scared and informing on each other.” The success of such hotlines come less from the people who are reported to it, than the atmosphere of terror and mistrust it creates among the Russian public On top of that, the Kremlin remains eager to present the country as behind the invasion, despite  people being arrested at  separate anti-war protests on Saturday alone.  Currently, it is illegal to speak out or even show disapproval of the invasion of Ukraine. Even calling it a war is currently outlawed as Putin farcically claimed it was a “special operation”. On March , during one of a number of speeches the Russian President has made, he warned “scum” traitors that loyal Russians would “spit them out like a midge that flew into their mouths”. He spoke of Russian society in terms of purity, echoing sentiment heard in Nazi Germany. Putin said: ”I am convinced that this natural and necessary self-cleansing of society will only strengthen our country, our solidarity, cohesion and readiness to meet any challenge.”Speaking of Russian traitors, he added: “I do not judge those with villas in Miami or the French Riviera.£Or who canapost get by without oysters or foie gras or so-called aposgender freedoms.aposThe problem is they mentally exist there, and not here, with our people, with Russia. “The West will try to bet on the so-called fth column, on traitors...to ide our society...to provoke civil confrontation...to strive to achieve its aim. And there is one aim - the destruction of Russia.” The term ‘fth column’ was previously used by Stalin to described anyone he decided was against his Communist party.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mozart to jazz trio ecossaise delight ardrishaig","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Arts Associationwas delighted to welcome Trio Ecossaise as guest performers at Ardrishaig Public Hall for the fourth concert of the season.The impact of Covid has meant that many planned concerts had to be cancelled or dates changed so it was wonderful to have Trio Ecossaise perform on March .The concert opened with the Kegelstatt Trio by Mozart. Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

What we are hoping to do is turn some of what nature dealt us into a positive.#We would like to hear from woodland owners who think they may have a suitable ash that we could use to promote the hardwood sector.#Scottish Forestry’s forest industries advisor Ros Wardman added: #As part of the project all the stages from finding the tree, to processing, milling, drying, selecting makers, and creating the furniture, will be fully documented. It’s a great way to showcase Scottish workmanship at its finest.#A strong element of the show will be to educate the public about ash dieback and other tree diseases affecting the hardwood sector.#If we can find a grand tree, it would be a fitting and productive end to a tree that was brought down prematurely by the storms, or about to felled because of the disease.#Woodland owners who think they may have a large ash or ash strands affected by the storms should contact the Scottish Furniture Makers Association on info@scottishfurnituremakers.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 4 4 2 2 2 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Fyne Ales has struck gold in a prestigious industry awards scheme.One of the Cairndow-based brewery#s best-selling products, Hurricane Jack, won gold at this year’s national SIBAIndependent Beer Awards.The fruity blonde ale advanced to the national finals after topping the Scottish cask heats in , seeing off stf competition to be named the UK’s best cask bitter up to . per cent.Hurricane Jack is brewed using US Amarillo and Cascade hops.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

It’s a hormone which helps build trust and attachment, as opposed to cortisol, which increases stress levels.We do sometimes need cortisol when faced with a challenge or fearful situation, so it does have its . It’s part of our fight and flight response. But the problem arises when levels remain too high for an extended period of time, as this keeps our bodies under a constant state of stress.When this happens, it can cause anxiety and depression, but also lots of physical issues such as headaches and tummy pain. It’s very dficult to concentrate and remember things when we are in this state.The study showed that for children in hospital, a time full of stress and worry for many reasons, storytelling resulted in an increase in oxytocin levels and reduction of cortisol, and so made the children feel less anxious and stressed, and even helped ease their physical pain.While the context of this research was children in the very stressful situation of being in hospital, I think the results and conclusions are also relevant for children in other stressful settings, including at school and home. I’m not making a direct comparison, but we’ve not had ‘normal times’ recently, and even in usual times, high levels of stress can be a big issue for many. So levels of stress and anxiety are heightened, even beyond the ‘normal’ for many of us.Some of the language in the article is related to the science of the findings, but the conclusions and observations are things teachers, parents and storytellers of all kinds will recognise. It describes how children being told the story “are transported to another possible world during storytelling sessions” and can “elicit positive physiological and psychological changes”. In other words, it can have a positive effect on physical and mental health.This transportation to “another possible world” is what storytellers often refer to as the story trance. It’s when children are absorbed in a story, and taken by their imagination to the world the story creates. The report explains that this absorption stimulates ious parts of the brain and aids the listener’s development of empathy, as well as a better understanding of their own emotions.None of this is really surprising, of course. But it’s really useful to have this kind of scientic back-up. An important finding was that the stories told were ones widely available and not specically adapted for therapeutic use just the kind of tales you find in a book from the library.And while they used professional storytellers for the research, a key point was that everyone can have this impact, including parents and caregivers: “It is important to note that even though we have used experienced storytellers for our research purposes, we believe that parents should be encouraged to tell their children stories. As we have shown, it is not necessary to use special stories or books or even specic techniques to achieve a successful outcome. Storytelling can be an effective means of creating important emotional bonds.”As I have said, this study looked at the impact of storytelling for children in hospital, which can be a deeply distressing time for both child and parents.Reading the report made me remember the time I was seven years old in the Western General Hospital, in an isolation ward by myself, very ill. I was told a story about a dragon who lived in a castle, and was given a model castle, made from used toilet rolls, and painted silver. I’d look at it when I was alone, which I always was except for visits. It was a stage for my imagination. I’d speak to the dragon and imagine the adventures I’d have with him when I finally got out of hospital. These stories were always my secret, but they helped me get out of hospital and have fun, when in the real world I could do neither.The thing is, our kids, as well ourselves, need this. The story is part of it, the characters, the challenges, the suspense, the connection to the emotions in the tale. It all works on our brain and our being. But it’s also the process of storytelling: the togetherness it creates, the shared space and attention, the heart-to-heart connection, the stimulation of imagination. Not even the best film on a screen does that.We are all storytellers, but sometimes it is good to be reminded just how important it is to be so, and that includes listening to, as well as telling, stories.As the report concluded: “Stories possess a symbolic dimension that seems to create a natural bridge to the core of our humanity.”"},{"url":null,"title":"leading-pig-farmers-plea-cabinet-secretary","story":"Mairi Gougeon MSP was accompanied by county MSP Paul McLennan on the visit to one of several high-health pig farms run by Mr Wyllie.Pig farms across Scotland are all operating at a substantial and growing loss.Mr Wyllie, of Ruchlaw Mains, Stenton, estimates that losses of about £ per pig in February last year have since deepened to more than £ per pig. Overdrafts are rising at an alarming rate and several Scottish farmers have already sold off sows to cut losses.The pig sector encountered signicant disruption during the Covid- pandemic which affected processing capacity and saw the partial closure of Scotland’s largest pig abattoir facility at Brechin.Much to the disappointment of NFU Scotland, several major retailers have continued to stock signicant volumes of imported pork, undermining, the union says, home production.And the dramatic spike in animal feed prices in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has also signicantly increased the scale of current losses on pig farms.It is in the interests of Scottish consumers, processors, and retailers, adds the union, that farmgate prices for pigs rise immediately to stave off a rapid rate of herd liquidations.Speaking on behalf of NFU Scotland, Mr Wyllie thanked the Cabinet Secretary for the pig hardship scheme in Scotland, established following the Covid-driven closure of the Brechin abattoir, but called on her to consider further immediate, direct support for the sector to ensure a critical mass of production was preserved.He also asked for the Scottish Government to consider an ‘Ongoers’ loan scheme to help financially support those who saw their future in the industry.NFU Scotland called on the Scottish Government to seek greater retailer support for Scottish pork, highlighting that a small percentage increase in the volume of home-produced pork on supermarket shelves would make a considerable dference.Help in re-establishing the Chinese export licence at Brechin, lost because of the Covid outbreak at the plant, would also expand the market opportunities for Scottish pig producers.At a UK level, NFU Scotland called for the Scottish Government to push Westminster on the need for “proper border controls” to monitor pork imports and for the English language requirements for overseas butchers looking to come to the UK to work in the staff-strapped processing sector to be relaxed."},{"url":null,"title":"world-cup-2022-draw-watch","story":"At the moment  out of the  countries that will take part in the competition are set, with there still being three intercontinental playoff matches to take place before the final set of teams is listed.The fate of Wales and Scotland is still hanging in the balance in one of those playoff matches, whilst England qualied top of their group at the first stage of qualying.Heres all the information on the draw including, where to watch it.The #Qatar draw is coming today! 🤯 Tune in tonight to find out the fate of your nation.Which team do you want to avoid  Comment below!#NowIsAll pic cZYFHdZSNThe draw for the tournament takes place on Friday, April , at the DECC venue in Doha, Qatar at circa pm BST.BBC One will air coverage of the draw, with the programme starting at .pm, and this will also be available to livestream on BBC iPlayer.The  teams will be drawn into eight groups of four teams, with Qatar assured a spot in Group A.The other nations will be split into four pots based on FIFA rankings.Each group will have no more than one nation from any confederation, aside from Europe which can have no more than two nations in any one group.Pot ATime to meet your destiny.Find out who your nation will play at #QatarTonight, pm Doha time 🔮 pic mAmpNXIzzPot BPot CPot DThe playoff matches that are yet to be contested are:"},{"url":null,"title":"reveals-north-berwick-one-uks-best-seaside-towns","story":"The town received an overall rating of %.The list was compiled by reviews from more than , visitors who gave feedback on their recent trips to seaside towns, villages and resorts.Destinations were rated on their beaches, attractions, value for money, peace and quiet, and scenery.North Berwick scored the following for these categories:Beach:  Attractions:  Value for money:  Peace and quiet:  Scenery:  On Tripadvisor, visitors to North Berwick praise the town for its day trips, excursions and sights to see.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

It’s part of ambitious UK Government plans to turbo-charge our national recovery from COVID-. At the centre of this initiative is Jobcentre Plus.Jobcentre Plus has a long and successful track record of matching quality employers with quality candidates. Now, many highly-skilled people have found themselves unemployed for the first time, and are considering new roles in new sectors. Jobcentre Plus can quickly put companies in touch with candidates who can make a real dference to their businesses.We talk to employers and employees about how they have benefited from working with Jobcentre Plus. vw, px\"  ‘Working with Jobcentre Plus is a no brainer’: Jordan, Contracts Manager, Elite Scaffolding, YeovilElite Scaffolding – a family-owned business that is part of the Denholm Group, reached out to Jobcentre Plus in a bid to reach younger potential employees looking for an apprenticeship.#We initially approached the jobcentre, simply for advice and to askthey could place an ad on their system. We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent. One of my Elite Scaffolders said it’s not just about finding me a job but changing my le…You certainly can’t ask for better than that.#‘Welcome’: Samuel, JD Sports Apprentice, RochdaleSamuel’s career got off to a flying start with a six-month placement through Jobcentre Plus at JD Sports.“I saw JD Sports was advertising and I thought I’d go for it because it was an administration role in a big company. Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year. Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing on the placement.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

The strength of attachment to people and place shines through both.Blood is stronger than breeding., ‘blood is thicker than water’, and perhaps it should come as no surprise to us that a society which places strong emphasis on ancestry and blood ties should have so many proverbs reinforcing such beliefs..Sad is the inheritance of a bad disease.This proverb is the perfect reminder that not everything we inherit from our ancestors is good.

It is now surely a matter of huge regret for our communities that so many small-scale care providers # despite their good reputation and obvious appeal in rural parts of the country – have been allowed to wither on the vine and disappear. on standards which followed the Covid outbreak in April and May .Budhmor’s owners are not a shadowy offshore conglomerate trying to put profit before care – but CrossReach, the social arm of the Church of Scotland. Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4553935.jpg--.jpg?1648651423000\n","title":"wrightbus continues recruitment search with 50 new jobs","story":"WORLD leading bus manufacturer Wrightbus is hosting a recruitment evening on Thursdayas it continues to bolster its ranks with an additional  staff after an increase in orders.The Ballymena-based company is launching the second phase of its recruitment drive ready for an increase in the production schedule after Easter.

All our jobs will be posted on the company’s website and social media accounts.” Wrightbus is at the forefront of the zero emission public transport movement.

This increase will see the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter rise by about pound per year to pound,. Those customerswith a prepayment gas meterwill see costs increase by around pound per year to pound,. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm. Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets. This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year. For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, the Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.” Consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or struggling to pay to top-up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support.

Our paper production expert, Poppy Cox, was indeed a load of poppycock, and of course we couldn’t do an April Fool about paper without mentioning foolscap. And we had to make our ‘official’ statement at midday because,we hadn’t, we’d be the fools for carrying on!  The forthcoming election is set to be postponed for a fortnight due to insufficient amounts of the correct type of ballot paper, we understand. It is believed that the specic type of tree used to make the paper - Flora Plio – has been in short supply in recent months. Paper production expert, Poppy Cox, explained why this specic type of tree was used for the production of ballot papers. “It has a special waxy quality that prevents the mark you make on your ballot paper being rubbed out,” said Mrs Cox. “That obviously adds an added level of security to the elections and stops people claiming that their ballot has been changed.” Alternatives are now being sought and the two week delay in the vote will hopefully allow for the ballot to be printed on a dferent type of paper. “It is possible that we could see a special kind of foolscap being useda secure alternative can’t be found,” Mrs Cox added.

The SDLP#s MP for the area, Claire Hanna, who romped home in the last general election with some , votes, around , more than the nearest candidate — expressed her shock at the turn of events. The constituency is also larger than East and West Belfast and is the most erse of all NI#s electoral areas, ing MLAs from five dferent parties: SDLP, DUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and Greens. There is a term for this move by Sinn Fein we are all too familiar with: gerrymandering.What is most curious about this move is that, back in , proposed changes to electoral boundaries here that would seemingly have favoured the DUP were branded “gerrymandering to placate” Northern Ireland#s largest unionist party by Sinn Fein. This criticism was not voiced by one Sinn Fein representative or party spokesperson at the time, but at least half a dozen, in what was essentially a media blitz in a bid to put a spanner in the proposals.What is even more curious is that press statements on Sinn Fein#s website referring to said gerrymandering have vanished. If you simply google “Sinn Fein on gerrymandering” and click on any of the ious links which previously directed to statements from Conor Murphy, Colm Gildernew, Francie Molloy and others on the Sinn Fein website, you are greeted with the following  error message, reading: “We#re sorry, but the page you requested could not be found on our servers. We may have recently moved, renamed, or deleted certain pages.”It seems, much like the party#s previous stance on Russia, they are simply trying to avoid accusations of double standards and prone to extreme stance-switching when it suits them.Read MoreSinn Fein defend proposals to redraw Belfast’s electoral boundariesAn April Fool’s wish listDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ah, April Fool#s Day. Given the state of world at the minute — war in Europe, the cost of living crisis on the tail end of a pandemic that hasn#t gone away - I was hoping we would give it a rest this year, lest we cause more unneeded distress. One humorous political wish list, however, was posted on Twitter by human rights organisation Participation and the Practice of Rights , reading: “‘Stick your hostile environment’ — Givan tells UK Home Office. ‘Mackies will be % social’ — Hargey takes action on housing rights. ‘Our policies are the problem, not you’ — Swann promises counsellors in every GP practice.” We can but dream.NI#s most unambiguous partyAn interesting press statement was released by the TUV on Friday, which declared that the party#s designation on the ballot paper for May#s poll will read: ‘TUV — No Sea Border’.Explaining the move, TUV leader Jim Allister said: “Having led where others have followed we wish every voter to see the issue identied without ambiguity on the ballot paper. There will be no doubt as to what a vote for TUV means.”Now, the TUV have been accused of being many things, but ‘ambiguous’ is definitely not one of them. Anyone with even a slight grasp of Northern Ireland politics could probably predict the party’s stance on any given issue before Jim Allister’s party has voiced its opinion. So this just seems like a needless waste of ink. I doubt anyone was going to be mistaken that they were actually voting for a bunch of liberal Europhiles.Related topicsSinn FéinSDLPConor MurphyClaire HannaMore On Sinn Féin PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slurs PremiumPoles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ value PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border poll PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseMost ReadFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveBelfast family’s  legacy to church now worth nearly £mBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayWatch: How to make Bored of Lunch#s airfryer Creme Egg croissant balls PlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeLatestLady Gaga pays emotional tribute to absent Tony Bennett at GrammysTaylor Hawkins headlines in memoriam section at the GrammysOlivia Rodrigo claims her second major Grammy of the nightAmerican Jenner Kupcho claims first LPGA title at Chevron ChampionshipWhat the papers say – April ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit :Sinn FeinGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA victims’ campaigner has questioned the use of the Europa Hotel as the setting for Sinn Fein’s election launch, saying it’s a venue the Provisional IRA “systematically bombed”.On Tuesday, Michelle O’Neill gave a speech at the Great Victoria Street hotel, which was bombed  times during the Troubles.She outlined Sinn Fein’s priorities ahead of the upcoming election including the cost of living crisis and “fiercely defending” the Good Friday Agreement.“The facts are that the balance of power at Stormont has shted irreversibly and political unionism must come to terms with the fact the world is moving on fast,” Ms O’Neill said.“So, while the DUP and the TUV are trying to take us backwards, our message is clear, we are only moving forward.”Commenting on the choice of venue, Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United said: Sinn Fein clearly don#t do irony, to bleat on about upholding democracy at the very venue which the Provisional IRA systematically attacked again and again, making it the most bombed hotel in Europe is brazen to say the least.However, due to the intensity of the Provisional IRA#s bombing campaign — and that of other terrorists, few hotel venues across Northern Ireland have come away unscathed by the Troubles.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up TUV South Belfast candidate Andrew Girvin said Sinn Fein’s campaign launch at the Europa was a “grotesque spectacle” given the setting.“Here we had the political wing of the terrorist organisation which repeatedly bombed the hotel in which they met daring to ponticate about democracy and respecting the will of the people.“There is nothing undemocratic about refusing to operate the Belfast Agreement structures which could foist a Sinn Fein First Minister upon Northern Ireland.“The choice of venue for this republican jamboree underscores the fact that no unionist should ever agree to take up the position of deputy to a Sinn Fein First Minister.“Yet just weeks out from the election both the DUP and UUP are dodging this vital question.Will they act as bridesmaid to Michelle O#Neill  Why is there reluctance to be open and honest with the public on this point ”The DUP#s Gordon Lyons said Sinn Fein#s election launch demonstrates their priority lies on holding a border poll rather than on helping families or rebuilding Northern Ireland’s economy.The party#s director of elections said: Sinn Fein#s rally was a show of strength for a border poll.“Whilst the DUP has a five-point plan to build a better future for Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein wants to win the election to implement their plan for a border poll.“There is a clear choice on offer to people whether they want a future focused on fixing our health system, tackling the cost of living crisis and replacing the protocol, or one fixated on a isive border poll.“When Michelle O#Neill talks about making history, we know it isn#t record levels of investment into our hospitals she is referring to. Now is not the time for ision and uncertainty.That is why this election is so important.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.Speaking at an election launch, Ms O’Neill said that Sinn Fein will defend but not renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement.The former Deputy First Minister said those who hanker for the past need to realise that there is no going back, only forward.Sinn Fein#s Stormont leader also described the DUP#s collapse of the Executive as political vandalism, although her own party also brought Stormont down in the same Assembly mandate.She said: When the Assembly, Executive and North South Ministerial Council were restored in January  it was with a shared commitment to deliver the public services, societal reforms and future that our people need and deserve.It was ambitious to form a five-party coalition Executive, but it was achieved, getting us back to genuine power-sharing, and thankfully so, because while everyone knew there would be challenges ahead, no one could have predicted that in only a matter of weeks that our Executive would be dealing with a global pandemic that would have such devastating impacts on every part of society, community and people#s lives and livelihoods.It is to the credit of all ministers from across the five parties that they responded and have worked with a unity of purpose, and unity of leadership for the past two years.This is what the public want to see more of — co-operation and delivery.Ms O#Neill added: Sinn Fein will be defending, not renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement now, or in the time ahead.Ms O#Neill said the May  election was the most important in a generation.Related topicsSinn FéinMichelle O#NeillIRACost of LivingTraditional Unionist VoiceGordon LyonsThe Executive OfficeMore On Sinn Féin PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slurs PremiumPoles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ value PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border pollAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyMost ReadFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveBelfast family’s  legacy to church now worth nearly £mBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayWatch: How to make Bored of Lunch#s airfryer Creme Egg croissant balls PlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismLatestLady Gaga pays emotional tribute to absent Tony Bennett at GrammysTaylor Hawkins headlines in memoriam section at the GrammysOlivia Rodrigo claims her second major Grammy of the nightAmerican Jenner Kupcho claims first LPGA title at Chevron ChampionshipWhat the papers say – April ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Brian Lawless PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe UUP manesto has enough meat to show that the party is starting to think seriously about being a major player in the Executive once more, and enough bare bones to reveal that the process is incomplete.At , words, this document is serious in its scope and suffused with the liberal unionist tone of new leader Doug Beattie.But it is what this manesto does not say which reveals most: hard choices or unpopular proposals are either absent or presented in oblique terms — and that jars with Mr Beattie’s straight-talking style.Health is the first and the iest section — unsurprisingly, given that polling has shown Robin Swann to be Stormont’s most popular minister.The manesto indicates support for radical measures, saying that the pandemic has shown that both patients and medics are willing “to travel longer distancesit means receiving care and support in a more timely manner. It is essential that the opportunities currently before us are not lost”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreNo united Ireland for generations to come, UUP leader insistsAndrew Madden:OpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeThat seems to hint at support for implementing the decades of reports which say Northern Ireland has too many small hospitals, some of which need to be closed or downgraded to centralise expertise in centres of excellence.But the UUP is not explicit about this.There are other hints of centralising services — “a regionally consistent approach to cancer services across Northern Ireland” with “regional pathways and rapid diagnostic clinics”.The party also proposes greater evening and weekend use of theatres, but hints at the cost by saying it will mean “properly incentivising the move towards a genuine seven day a week health service”.Signicantly, the party says it would ban the use of contract agency workers — but only “once the immediate HSC pressures subside” .Health trusts are sharply criticised, with the UUP saying that for too long “sub-optimal trust performances [have been] tolerated”, something which suggests frustration at what Mr Swann has seen within the system.His solution is a new operationally independent HSC chief executive accountable to a board with political, professional and civic society membership, similar to the Policing Board.On the NI Protocol, the UUP says that “unionists cannot accept an internal border within the United Kingdom. There can be no border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.That simple commitment seems to prevent the UUP signing up to any revised protocol involving an Irish Sea border.Its tone is dferent to the DUP, talking about wanting to “maintain good relations with the EU”, but the content is similar to that of the ERG — pushing mutual enforcement, with a new north-south body to oversee this. A requirement to label GB goods coming into NI “for UK sale only” would only avoid a new Irish Sea borderit was enforced for all UK products.The party would ban gay conversion therapy, establish a gambling regulator, allocate overdue investment to football stadia, and examine letting private garages do MoT tests.The party opposes a Troubles amnesty and robustly says paramilitaries “need to be put out of business permanently” by focussing on their leaderships and criminal assets. It wants to curb legal aid, due to “the culture of lawfare which has been allowed to develop within our legal system and which has proved extremely lucrative for a number of firms”.The manesto is laden with more spending — new train stops, new busses, new roads, more rates relief for some businesses, spending on city deals,  more police officers, and looking at giving everyone in primary school a free meal.How this would be paid for is unclear. There is no talk of increasing rates. Water charges are ruled out. And giving Stormont more tax powers is also rejected. Changing the status of NI Waterand the Housing Executive to allow them to borrow is about as far as funding proposals go.This is a detailed document, yet many of the proposals are all things to all people – it is pro-business, but also pro-worker pro-grammar schools, but looking to review how academic selection operates, pro-EU, but anti-protocol.None of those things are necessarily contradictory, but in not being clearer about some of the most controversial or unpopular areas, the party is putting off having to take those decisions until after they’ve got the votes.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyDoug BeattieThe Executive OfficeRobin SwannNI ProtocolMore On Ulster Unionist Party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudge PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idleCarrickfergus murder probe: Woman’s horror at reservoir body find PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismMost ReadFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveBelfast family’s  legacy to church now worth nearly £mBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayWatch: How to make Bored of Lunch#s airfryer Creme Egg croissant balls PlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeLatestLady Gaga pays emotional tribute to absent Tony Bennett at GrammysTaylor Hawkins headlines in memoriam section at the GrammysOlivia Rodrigo claims her second major Grammy of the nightAmerican Jenner Kupcho claims first LPGA title at Chevron ChampionshipWhat the papers say – April ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many people would prefer the salesman, but in fact this is a moment where voters hold more power than politicians.Knowing a little bit about how political parties approach canvassing and what they are hoping to achieve can help you to play the system to your advantage — and also help the politicians, eventhat involves the discomfort of hearing your disobliging comments about themselves or their party.Despite all the sophistication of modern politics, knocking doors to persuade a voter to back one candidate over another is still a key element of political success.Two decades ago, a US study by Alan S Gerber and Donald P Green at Yale University found that in a randomised field experiment of , voters in Connecticut voter turnout was increased substantially by personal canvassing, slightly by direct mail, and not at all by telephone calls.They hypothesised that falling electoral turnout was linked to a decline in face-to-face campaigning. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreThe  key questions to ask candidates looking for your voteMuch has changed since then. Social media is now the sexiest tool for political parties and allows those with money to get ultra-targeted messages advertised on the screens of the voters they need — a particular benefit for parties struggling to attract dedicated campaigners to tramp streets.But some people — particularly some elderly voters — still value a personal knock on the door, believing thata candidate wants their vote enough they should come and ask for it.However, canvassing is not just one-way traffic.Yes, the canvasser is trying to sell their candidate to you — but they are also harvesting information.It might seem rude when they askyou would vote for their party, but that is part of a vast data-harvesting operation to identy likely voters whose names will be entered in their database .Depending on how likely you say you are to vote, you may be targeted again closer to the election or on polling day as the party moves to its ‘get out the vote’ operation.But they are not just taking in your answer to that one question they are hearing — or should be — what you are saying about other things your reasons for liking their party, your reasons for disliking it, your priorities, the things you think their party has misunderstood about people like you, or whatever it might be that you say.If large numbers of people are saying similar things to a party’s canvassers, the message is taken seriously by any competent party. This is a form of mass polling, and while politicians may say they don’t believe the polls when they deliver unwelcome news, they believe it when they hear it first hand or through colleagues. This is the most nervous time for a politician — especially for one in a party which is losing support.And yet few voters realise that this is the time when their power is greatest. Voters hold in their hands not only the careers of inidual MLAs, but the fates of parties.A veteran of canvassing in Northern Ireland said that % of people “want you off their door as quickly as possible”, and few say much about how they will vote. But that works in favour of those who do engage —you are part of the % who express your views, they will be seen as far more representative than in fact they may be, because so many other people declined to engage.However you engage with canvassers, be respectful — even to those from parties which you may detest. This is about more than basic good manners democracy can only candidates who profoundly disagree with each other put their names forward for election.Whatever you think about the candidates, it takes courage to put yourself up for what is a form of public popularity contest where the result is announced live on TV. It can be humiliating, and involves its own form of bravery.Many of the canvassers will not be politicians, will not be paid, and may not even be members of the party they are advertising.Today we bring you ten questions you can ask those knocking your door to both get across your views and tease out whether they are worthy of your vote.Most ReadFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterBelfast family’s  legacy to church now worth nearly £mSuzanne BreenOpinionScare tactics a last, desperate resort of an ailing DUPUVF-linked charity’s £k in Irish cashTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayWatch: How to make Bored of Lunch#s airfryer Creme Egg croissant balls PlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismLatestLady Gaga pays emotional tribute to absent Tony Bennett at GrammysTaylor Hawkins headlines in memoriam section at the GrammysOlivia Rodrigo claims her second major Grammy of the nightAmerican Jenner Kupcho claims first LPGA title at Chevron ChampionshipWhat the papers say – April ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ofgem has to get a grip because the universal service obligation is at serious risk.“Unite’s postal managers are the heart of this service and our union will back them all the way in this fight to protect jobs and services.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may, however, be an unsightly visual impact created by the large tunnel entrances needed in Strangford and Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A new school is to be constructed on the site of the existing St

out in favour of a new school on the existing site, he added.Mr McGrady said this week: ldquoI welcome this development as I have been making on-going representations on the matter to Lord Belstead

ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who has compiled a report on underway drinking which is to be presented to Down Council.KILLYLEAGH ndash The town of Killyleagh is set for a financial boost to help revive its economic, commercial and

officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The

fulfilling its tourist potential.LEITRIM ndash An  month battle to have a Leitrim footpath declared a right of way has found its way to Westminster.The Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints has been asked to investigate Banbridge Councilrsquos handling of the matter after more than  people signed a petition asking for the adoption of the footpath as a right-of-way.The footpath, which is marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August  when the petition was formally presented, and shortly afterwards the council voted overwhelmingly to adopt the pathway, subject to legal opinions.However, for the next  months no progress was made on the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people.

Villagers had suffered from the awful impact of the Hungry Thirties in one of the most socially deprived regions of the UK after the closure of the village spinning mill in .By November  United Chrome Tanners were employing  people tanning sheep skins and cattle hides for shoes, handbags and clothing.Within less than  years they were a world leader, employing more than  people and under the leadership of Erik Utitz became the first NI winners of the Queens award for exports.Leather tanning eventually died out in the village in .Details of the Jewish project, which received funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, can be found at this website: www.belfastjewishheritage.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Lawyer eyeing SDLP result in Strangford  ","story":"CONOR Houston is hoping to become Strangfordrsquos first SDLP Assemblyman when voters go to the polls on May .A lawyer and civic activist, he is going head-to-head against the DUP, UUP and Alliance who currently hold the constituencyrsquos five seats and as the parties ramp up their respective election campaigns, Mr Houston has outlined why he decided to put his name forward.He said he has been very fortunate to have had a lot of great opportunities throughout his career and wants to bring the experiences he has to make a positive impact on the people in Strangford.Mr Houston said while he has never been in politics before, there have been a few moments in his career that he believes shaped him for political le.ldquoAs a lawyer, I fought against unfairness and injustice, he continued. ldquoOne of the most frustrating things was seeing young people end up in the criminal justice system.ldquoSo many of them came from situations of poverty, abuse, addiction and been failed by our education and care systems.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

But when it comes to casting their ballots, up to % of people who go have hitherto gone to the polls in NI elections have voted for political parties who are primarily identied by their stance on the constitutional question.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Even in recent elections the non-aligned centre ground, despite having surged , are doing well to get more than % of the votes.Do not be fooled by anyone who says that the protocol is only of importance to unionists, and that even many unionists do not care. Many of the people who make this point themselves care very much about the Irish Sea border — they want to keep it, either because they support staying in the EU , or because they see it as major step towards an economic united Ireland, and thus towards a more general all-Ireland.It is true that many of the more apolitical unionists are much more relaxed about the protocol than they should be, but that is typically because it is complex .It is also because such unionists heard that the protocol offered the best of both worlds .Thus unionists should have been, and should still be, trying to explain and reiterate to some of the more apathetic pro Union voters the ultimate impact of the NI Protocol. This would entail trying to revive some of the spirit of indignation that there was in the early months of , when many people across the Province were suddenly finding that they could not get deliveries from Great Britain that they had always been able to get before.The EU has been keen to agree to case-by-case exemptions to checks in part because it does not want the wider public to be troubled by the protocol. Needless to say, therefore, unionists badly need to see a large vote for parties that oppose the protocol.Doug Beattie’s approach to the Irish Sea border, of opposing it but calling for engagement in the pursuit of political solutions to the problems that it creates, has a high-wire quality. If the Alliance vote goes down, even slightly, on recent elections, and the Ulster Unionist Party vote increases, Mr Beattie will be able to say that his tactics have stemmed the decline of unionism by broadening its appeal.If Alliance continues upwards, and the UUP does not rise, he will be seen to have not only been weak on the protocol, but having failed to win over moderates in the process.l The second key thing to watch out for in the election is turnoutThere was a time in the s and early s when it seemed voters in the western world were losing interest in politics.Countries such as the UK and United States were increasingly wealthy and many bitter political disagreements of the s and s seemed to give way to a more bland, moderate politics. In Northern Ireland itself, this wider trend towards consensus seemed to be reflected in the  Belfast Agreement. But this sense of stable politics has evaporated, at home and abroad. There are now bitter ides on major issues of national and global importance, and much turbulence in voting patterns.The Brexit referendum of  had a higher turnoutthan most recent UK general elections have done.The Scottish independence plebiscite in  had an even higher turnout .The fiercely contested, and narrowly decided, US presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in November  had one of the highest turnouts of any presidential race in modern memory .In Northern Ireland, the turnout surged from % of voters in the  Stormont election to % a year later, in the more fraught atmosphere of the election after Sinn Fein collapsed the institutions.There is now keen interest in conflicts and politics at home and abroad.

Your commitment and dedication has been truly remarkable. This was a team effort and it has been a huge honour to be involved.“From the outset we have known that every jab counts and it is thanks to you that there have been many lives saved, and far, far fewer people seriously ill in hospital due to covid. You should be very proud of the role you have played.”Speaking to the public, Ms Donnelly said: “Thank you for rolling up your sleeves and helping to protect yourselves and those around you from this terrible disease. However we’re not at the finish line just yet. I’ve made plenty of appeals to the public in the past  months but I’m sure I’ll be forgiven for one more - please come forward for your jabs.“It’s vital that everyone in the  plus age group and those who have severely weakened immune systems come forward for their spring booster. I would again encourage everyone who is eligible for their booster to get it without delay. Vaccination clinics are still running across Northern Ireland and people are still coming forward for boosters as well as first and second doses. It’s not too late to get protected.”Patricia was a clinical psychologist by profession and held a number of key positions at Trust level before retiring.

Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann says that testing will continue to play a vital role in Northern Ireland’s response to COVID- over the coming months but that a “more targeted approach” will be introduced on a phased basis from April, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness.Under the new policy, PCR testing in NI will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop Covid symptoms.Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting, such as a care home, until the end of June, with a further review then.The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced in Northern Ireland until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June.The full range of changes to take effect from  April in Northern Ireland are as follows-* PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.* Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.* Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.* Routine asymptomatic testing - testing for those with no symptoms - will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.* Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.* Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.* Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.* Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .* Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.”The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

When I spoke to him about five or six weeks ago and told him that I had planned to do this and to seek his permission, he was blown away and I think that’s the measure of the man.“I want to say to Phil, thank you, I want to say to his team thank you and in recognition of all of those things on behalf of the town he loved so well I would like to move forward and award him the freedom of the city.”Seconding the motion Alliance councillor Rachael Ferguson described Mr Coulter as a “son of the city”, praising the work he has done “highlighting the good that comes from the city”.Emmet DoyleIrelandDerry  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularIn Pictures - The official opening of the Royal Black Institution state-of-the-art headquarters in Loughgall‘TUV - No Sea Border’ given approval for ballot papersAttack on Northern Ireland war memorial: given war in Ukraine, people should have more respectRevealed: the  UUP candidates on a mission to deliver fresh leadership‘SF wants to sleepwalk other parties into border poll plan’Most PopularRod Stewart tour : when tickets go on sale for extra UK dates - including London, Glasgow and BirminghamBest air beds for camping UK : inflatable beds to keep you comfy from Outwell, Vango, and SnugpakBest bread makers - tried and tested, from Panasonic, Morphy Richards, and LakelandWhat’s going to happen in Season  of Netflix’s Bridgerton: what happens in Julia Quinn’s novels, where to buyBest head torches UK : bright, reliable head torches for camping, hiking, and mountaineering                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt seems over the years, Barry Island seems to be the shining light of identity for the Barry and District.However, many times have I been asked this, \"Karl-James Langford, was Barry Island ever an island \"Well, I could ignore the question and reply in a sarcastic way, but one, never does. For when you look at the area today, it is dficult to think of a time when Barry Island was just that an island surrounded by water at hightide.For after  for all those dams, and bridges built across The Sound, slowly dragged Barry Island to the mainland. The water logged landscape has now been lost within a landscape of housing and other development.Barry Island until  was nothing more than a place lost in time with a rundown farmhouse, outbuildings and forgotten about sacred wells until things changed. Francis Crawshay purchased Barry Island in  a very eccentric man, who saw that his new home The Marine Hotel, was to accommodate friends visiting him on the Island.You may add that the image we examine today is of a dferent structure. The original Marine Hotel of Francis Crawshay building on the start of Friars Point, was eventually renamed Friars Point House, at which point the original name became redundant. However, as Barry Island became a focal point of day trippers, and visits for those building the dock, accommodation was required.Now, towards the end of the s, the Barry and District saw the construction of a number of Hotels, and  of which, after being opened never received the licences for the purpose they were built, such as the Sea View Hotel on Dock View Road, which became the Sea View Labour Club.One of these new purpose-built hotels one of which was on Barry Island, however opened in , and adopted the name The Marine Hotel, as it was no longer being used for the grand building Friars Point. The Marine Hotel on the corner of Plymouth Road and Friars Point, was infact a much larger building than you can find today alas some parts of it were demolished over the past few decades. However, what building still remains although it is now been converted into flats, is still impressive..removeBack in the day, in the late s you entered through a very impressive Portico entrance, with stone details picked out in Portland stone. The rest of the structure utilising locally sourced Red brick. The Marine Hotel was the place to stay on Barry Island, with an array of fine rooms to stay it, after a long summer evening eating icecream on the sands of the Bay, oryou had been visiting the Barry and District on business.Now when viewing the building facing onto Friars Road, the scroll work surrounding the lettering entrapping the words  MARINE HOTEL. This is an echo of times when we built in a much grander way. Most of the buildings of note were built to last in the late s, in such a way the Marine Hotel was constructed.One thing of final note is that one local resident told me story that The Marine Hotel was a haunt of Leguards and Coastguards from Barry Island. And then ironically inquests were held into deaths caused to drowning, and other reasons at the Marine Hotel also.Many thanks for joining us this week. More from our enigmatic Barry and District next week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWith nearly all polling stations reporting, conservative economist Rodrigo Chaves had % of the vote, compared with % for former president Jose Figueres Ferrer, the supreme electoral tribunal said.More than % of eligible voters did not take part in Sunday’s election, however, reflecting the lack of enthusiasm Costa Ricans had for the candidates.In his victory speech, Mr Chaves said he received the result with humility and called for unity to address problems like unemployment and a soaring budget deficit. vw,vw,px, px\"Rodrigo Chaves greets supporters at a polling station “For me this is not a medal nor a trophy, but rather an enormous responsibility, heaped with challenges and dficulties that we will all resolve,” he said.“Costa Rica, the best is to come,” Mr Chaves said to celebrating supporters. His inauguration is scheduled for May .Mr Figueres conceded defeat less than an hour after results began to come in. He had led the first round of voting on February , with Mr Chaves in second that day. Neither had come close to the % of the vote needed to avoid a runoff.“Costa Rica has voted and the people have spoken,” Mr Figueres said. “As the democrats we are we will always be respectful of that decision.” vw,vw,px, px\"Rodrigo Chaves pumps his fist after casting his ballot Mr Figueres, who was Costa Rica’s president from  to , represents the National Liberation Party like his father, three-time president Jose Figueres Ferrer.Mr Chaves served briefly in the administration of outgoing president Carlos Alado and represents the Social Democratic Progress Party.Both men waged a bruising campaign that highlighted past controversies..removeMr Chaves’ campaign is under investigation by electoral authorities for allegedly running an illegal parallel financing structure. He also has been dogged by a sexual harassment scandal that drove him out of the World Bank.While working at the World Bank he was accused of sexual harassment by several women, was eventually demoted and then resigned. He has denied the accusations.More than . million Costa Ricans were eligible to vote, but with many voters underwhelmed by the options, turnout was even lower than the % in February.While Costa Rica has enjoyed relative democratic stability compared with other countries in the region, people have grown frustrated with public corruption scandals and high unemployment..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Ex-finance minister wins runoff vote to be Costa Rica us president article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Inspired by the area’s linen history, Rob Hilken’s mural at Linenhall Street depicts damask linen with a Jacquard weaving pattern that was created by local linen mills. The chrysanthemum damask design used was created by William Liddell and incorporates the distinctive pattern found on Jacquard loom punch cards, which were used to create the complex damask designs that made the Banbridge area world-famous for its linen.Belfast-based artist and illustrator FGB’smural at Bridge Street celebrates the town’s association to Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton who was educated at Banbridge Academy Preparatory School.

An ancient king’s road connecting Ulster to the rest of the island once crossed the Bann at a forging place a short distance downstream at Ballykeel.In addition to the new street art, one of Banbridge’s most iconic landmarks - a B-listed monument dedicated to Captain Crozier which memorialises his contribution to polar exploration - has undergone signicant restoration work.Holly Pereira on Newry Street.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"auction of hope needs your help ","story":"Shock as kne seized from -year-oldMurder suspect arrested after PSNI stop car on dual-carriagewayNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\"Loading...NewsPeopleAuction of Hope needs your helpTwo local women are calling for support for a major charity auction.By Elinor GlynnMonday, th April , : am\"\"Its now just a matter of days before Richard Beattie of Beattie Livestock Sales, prepares to take charge of a major charity auction.The ‘Auction of Hope ’ will take place on Friday, April , and aims to raise signicant funds to support two local charities, Air Ambulance NIand Cancer Fund for Children     \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"  \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"  \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

With his ear for a good story and eye for detail, Jack, who founded the historical group in , takes readers on a mirthful trip down memory lane.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They gradually gained popularity with the audience and, being held on the Monday night before the annual May Fair Day, reflected the atmosphere of jollication that pervaded the town at this special time of year.An eye-catching image from Ballyclare.“The music was provided by ious groups of instrumentalists – fiddlers, accordionists, tin whistle players – and their sessions were interspersed with songs, recitations and stories by local inidual entertainers drawn from the lore and culture of the Six Mile Water region. Many of these songs and much of the material came from an oral tradition and few were available in written form.”Verses of material from local ‘balladeers’ Ernie Scott, Sandy Robinson, Jock Gilmour and Matt Meharg together with short biographical details of these and many others feature in the pages of the book.Jack continued: “Sadly the concerts came to an end when the security situation dictated that crowds gathering in halls became impossible. The Historical Society planned to celebrate the th anniversary of the founding of the society in  by reviving the Rhymes and Ructions concert in  but the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic put paid to their plans.”In his introduction to Rhyme and Ructions Jack, who is the author of a number of local history studies including ‘Stories of a Letime’, also reveals what inspired this latest publication.Author Jack McKinney with his latest publication.“What I am endeavouring to do here is to compile a collection of the ballads and anecdotes that proved so popular at the concerts. The tone and subjects of the ballads y considerably from the amusing to those of a more contemplative nature. As for their credibility I leave the readers to assess this for themselves.”Jack has pursued his interest in local history and its characters with zeal since retiring in  after a four-decade career as an assistant and principal teacher in east Antrim primary schools. The former Mossley Primary School pupil, taught at Abbots Cross, Ballyclare and Whitehead Primary Schools. And in the manner in which he inspired many pupils, Jack is keen to share his enthusiasm for knowledge with a whole new generation of readers.A founder member of the Ulster-Scots Language Society, Jack added: “The ballads are recorded in the style of language used in the originals – standard English or Ulster- Scots. The stories and other text may contain either or both. I have often followed the style of a mixture of Ulster -Scots and English as in the Scottish ‘Kaleyard’ novels, familiar to readers of Archibald McIlroy’s books, where the conversational dialogue of characters is in Ulster-Scots with the rest of the narrative in standard English.”The ‘Wreck of the Never Budge’, ‘Courting and Possible Consequences’ or ‘The May Fair and lots of Houzeldoo’ provide a hint of Ballyclare May Fairs past and possible inspiration for future balladeers and storytellers.
