His first job in LA was at a gas station on Hollywood Boulevard, which soon became a hive of sexual activity          Scotty, now 95, with his wife, Lois they\u0027ve been married since 1984, and she says she had no idea about the extent of his social and sexual activities among the Hollywood elite when they got together. ‘I didn’t know him then,’ she says in the film. ‘I don’t know him as that person and not sure I want to – and I’m not interested in Hollywood shenanigans. I’m just not.’Scotty, now 95, eagerly recounts memories from his heyday as a ‘trick’ and facilitator for decades in Hollywood, showing off old pictures as well as reminiscing with some of the men he recruited or socialized with. He waited until all of the most famous players had passed away, however, before sharing their stories and publishing a tell-all book in 2012, Full Service.‘I often think back of how nice things were I can’t think back of any bad scenes or any bad things at all,’ Scotty says in the film. ‘So many people have said the nicest and best time of their whole life was that gas station. That’s why I felt good – that I made so many people happy.’He says: ‘When everyone was living, I would never even think, under any circumstances … no matter what anyone offered me, I wouldn’t write a book then.‘A lot of people at the time knew who these people were and what they were so, so it’s not a secret really,’ he tells one fan at a book signing. ‘It may be a secret for some square that lives in Illinois, but people who live in Hollywood? They knew these people.’When asked about his own sexuality, he answers: ‘I’m everything.’‘Scotty was pre-gay,’ Stephen Fry says in the film. ‘He himself doesn’t conform very particularly Scotty just breezes across all the fences that we erect to separate ourselves from others.’Director Tyrnauer had heard tales for years about the dual-function gas station before he actually met Scotty, he tells DailyMail.com. It was Tyrnauer\u0027s good friend Gore Vidal - to whom the documentary is dedicated - who eventually proved the crucial link.  \u0027One day he brought up the gas station, and he brought up the man behind it, Scotty Bowers,\u0027 he says. \u0027And I was astonished that Scotty was still around and that I had a personal connection to him. So at that moment, I decided this was my next film, almost sight unseen.\u0027Through Gore Vidal, I met Scotty I found out that he had finished the manuscript, which became his book ... And Scotty agreed to take part in the film, and we were off to the races.\u0027He adds: \u0027When I went to start filming Scotty, I discovered that there was a wife – and this astonishes a lot of people, that the leading male prostitute of his generation in Hollywood is married to a woman. And this just speaks to Scotty’s pansexuality.\u0027  Shocking moment girl throws milkshake and hits McDonald\u0027s staffMeghan gives Harry a kiss after handing out trophies at poloWoman throws chips and shouts abuse at McDonald\u0027s employeeFootage of man encouraging date to drive defective speedboatScooter rider dumps body of fatally stabbed teen in roadBystanders lift cleaning truck to free man stuck underneath itWorkman smashes car window to rescue three dogs on hottest dayMillionaire installs gates to block residents parking on trackDrivers queue for Eurotunnel in Folkestone in scorching heatTaxi driver pulls unconscious passenger into street and leaves himFootage appears to show boxer released after Hilton incident    Hunks in trunks: Scotty rang in his 90th birthday with a rather unusual cake delivered by scantily clad young men          Birthday boy: Scotty, now 95, celebrated his 90th birthday at LA\u0027s famous Chateau Marmont during the filming of the documentary           Bowers was raised in rural Illinois and served in the US Marines during World War II he says in the new documentary about his life: \u0027Many guys, when they got out of the service, they went back home again to the little town, to the farm I upgraded myself and went to Hollywood\u0027          Actor Walter Pidgeon met Scotty at the gas station and invited him home the encounter proved to be Scotty\u0027s entry into the sexual world of Hollywood starsWithin a matter of days after meeting Pidgeon, he says, word of mouth took off and his gas station became a hive of sexual activity.‘You couldn’t believe how busy I was I needed help,’ he says – so he recruited other men, even straight ones, telling them just to pretend they were having sexual liaisons with women if it helped them through it. Patrons of the station were charged $20 for each rendezvous.‘I was fixing every bit of 20 people a night, seven nights a week,’ he says in the film. He began to branch out from the gas station bathroom, letting other clients meet in a trailer that was kept on the property by one of his friends. When those were both busy, he could also arrange for discounted rooms at a nearby hotel where he knew the manager.He curried favour with George Cukor, the epicentre of the gay scene at the time who hosted debauched brunches each weekend with around a dozen of the most attractive men in Hollywood – where Scotty became indispensable.‘Scotty Bowers would always provide new talent,’ photographer Michael Childers says in the film, adding that ‘he wasn’t just this madame Cukor called for events he was also a friend.’Scotty segued into bartending, which helped with his ‘introduction’ service for the stars he had a common-law wife, Betty, and they eventually had a daughter, but Scotty was never home – speculating in the film that he might have taken Betty for a birthday dinner ‘once’ before the relationship broke down (which he fully blames on himself).Instead, he was out all days and at all hours, feeding the sexual demands of Hollywood at a time when stars were constrained by ‘morals’ clauses in their contracts. They couldn’t openly be gay or act on any non-mainstream proclivities, so Scotty arranged it all away from prying eyes.The list of A-list names in the film seems endless. Take, for instance, Randolph Scott and Cary Grant.‘I’d been with them inidually and both of them – what you call a three-way – and also I brought another buddy,’ Scotty says.‘Cole Porter would say, “Can you bring 15 guys?” … People have often said, you couldn’t have done that many things in a given week, fixing up that many people.’J. Edgar Hoover, May Davis, Laurence Olivier, Rock Hudson – he either hooked them up or participated himself, Scotty proudly claims. George Cukor’s estate factored into his dealings not just because of the director’s thriving gay social life but also because Hepburn and Spencer Tracy lived on the grounds – in separate cottages. For all appearances, the two performers were having an affair in reality, Scotty and other insiders insist, both were gay and they never actually lived together.‘She was a designer of her own legend, and she had several fervid relationships with talented other women,’ columnist Liz Smith says in the film. ‘She was very guarded about what she did.’‘George kind of told Katharine Hepburn early in the game what I did, in a way, and I could see running through her head: Well, if he fixes up guys, he should be able to fix up girls, too,’ Scotty says in the film. ‘I could see that. I fixed her up with every bit of 150 girls … over a period of 39 years. That’s almost 50 years that’s not unusual at all.’          Scotty, second from the far right, recruited other men for \u0027tricks\u0027 he hooked up with both genders and says, when asked about his sexual orientation: \u0027I\u0027m everything\u0027  Scotty claims to have had a three-some with Cary Grant, left, and Randolph Scott, right          Scotty says in the film that Katharine Hepburn\u0027s relationship with Spencer Tracy was for show and the actors never lived together he says that, when Hepburn was first informed about Scotty\u0027s activities, \u0027I could see running through her head: Well, if he fixes up guys, he should be able to fix up girls, too ... I fixed her up with every bit of 150 girls … over a period of 39 years\u0027He talks about his own relationship with Tracy, who would often drink until he was quite inebriated when the two were together.‘He’d get up and almost fall and put his arm around me and we’d go into bed,’ says Scotty, adding that, in the morning, the actor would ‘pretend nothing ever happened.’‘He really didn’t want to be gay or admit to himself he might possibly be, so the best way is not to admit it, right?’ Scotty says.And another couple he helped, he says, were actual royalty, not Hollywood royalty: Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson.‘When I took people to see Wally and Edward, I never told one person, even though they were close buddies,’ he says. ‘They were seen as Duke and Duchess.’He was recommended to them as a resource, he says, by photographer and designer Cecil Beaton – and the couple told him he came ‘highly recommended.’ He says Edward VII ‘liked to see guys and girls together and then sort of work his way in. If a guy wants to see a guy and a girl together, they’re usually gay or have a tendency to be gay – because if they were straight, why would they want the guy?’Wallis, he says, was ‘the one who’d do the talking … she was a real ballsy chick. But they thought what I did was the nicest thing that ever happened to them.’And when it comes to his own sexual proclivities and history, Scotty brags that he was a particularly interesting study for Dr Alfred Kinsey, the sexual research pioneer.‘When Dr Kinsey met me, he’d already heard about me that’s why he interviewed me about four, five, six times,’ he says, adding: ‘We became friends, and he liked to interview me. I was one of the only people that completed the interview from one end to the other, meaning you’ve done everything.’(That list of ‘everything’ included men, women and animals.)‘I got him not only the best interviews he had I took him to gang bang parties and things like that and put him in the f*****g bedroom and everybody f******, mainly guys,’ he says. ‘He’d be over there, and I’d crawl over to see if he had a hard-on, and he’d say: “Scotty, I’m just observing.”’‘Scotty did play an academic role in the sexual revolution, because he was the connective tissue between the academic, Kinsey, and the people who were doing it,’ says Peter Bart, former studio chief and former editor of Variety. ‘Scotty was a revelation to Kinsey.’Harry Styles struggling to sell opulent West Hollywood...From a Hollywood A-Lister, an eighties movie icon and a...Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio were among actors who TURNED...Share this articleMuch of the liberated and pleasurable antics that anchored Scotty’s world, however, took place against a backdrop of disapproval not just from studios but also from a legal and societal standpoint. Vice squads were out in force post World War II, and it wasn’t unusual for an effeminate inidual to get attacked on the street.One magazine, Confidential, was particularly aggressive about outing celebrities and spreading salacious stories – and it paid. Scotty says he was approached multiple times but always declined to confirm any stories, even true ones, that were floating around publication of such tales could easily end a star’s career.One of those stories, he said, happened at Frank Sinatra’s home in Palm Springs – ‘when I had a three-way with Ava Gardner and Lana Turner.’‘They were buddy-buddy, in those days,’ he says. ‘You know, they were a little stoned, and they were in the pool in the nude – and pretty soon, we’re in bed together. The word got around. ‘Confidential came to me with the story first I wouldn’t sign it.’Two others, however, ‘signed and went for the money.’  And when the advent of HIV and AIDS came about, everything changed – prompting Scotty to get out of the game. All of Hollywood was shocked and terrified, and Scotty talks in the film about how the survivors were simply winners in a game of luck.‘When AIDS came along, I thought, I’m going to pass on fixing people up, because I don’t want to be involved in that,’ he says in the film. ‘It’s a case where you just hope you don’t catch it.’It’s a topic he discussed frankly in his 2012 memoir, as well, writing: \u0027AIDS had launched itself in a vicious war against humanity. \u0027It brought an end to the sexual freedoms that had defined much of life in Tinseltown ever since the birth of the movies. I, too, underwent a major change. Tricking – whether for others or doing it myself – gradually slowed to a snail\u0027s pace. Sex used to be about having fun and a good time. The advent of AIDS didn\u0027t change that per se, but now sex could come at the cost of your very life. So, things changed. A lot.\u0027The wild and woolly days were over. The drag parties and gang bangs and swingers\u0027 evenings and orgies became a thing of the past. But life went on.\u0027Bowers’ own life, however, had seen its fair share of tragedy – which he acknowledges closer to the end of the documentary. His daughter, Donna, died at 23 after a botched abortion he points to her graduation photo and other pictures, her phone remains in one of his houses with the same number attached, and her clothes are still in her closet.He speaks of her sadly and fondly – though he admits that, as soon as he received news of her death, he continued working as the party facilitator that he was.‘Within an hour after I learned she died, I’m on the way to Malibu to a party with a carload of guys,’ he says. ‘I was 100 percent dependable, reliable … regardless of what it was.‘If I told someone I was going to be there, I’d be there. I never said anything to anyone about what had happened.’He was also, it turns out, carrying the tragic wartime death of his brother, Donald – who, though two years older, joined the Marines after Scotty. He was killed in 1945, one of nearly 7,000 American deaths at Iwo Jima.           Over the years, critics have questioned the veracity of some of Scotty\u0027s claims, arguing that most people involved are dead so cannot refute the stories. Documentary director Matt Tyrnauer says: \u0027I believe all of his stories. I checked them out they all check out, even some of the more outlandish ones, even some of the most outlandish ones check out very well. And I checked them with multiple sources and corroborating materials.\u0027          Scotty wrote a 2012 memoir, Full Service, detailing his sexual escapades and introductions he made for others he says he waited until the stars were dead to share their stories          Scotty says he secretly arranged trysts for Wallis Simpson and abdicated British king Edward VIII, claiming that \u0027they thought what I did was the nicest thing that ever happened to them\u0027          Director Matt Tyrnauer had heard tales of a dual-purpose gas station for years before he actually met Scotty Gore Vidal was a mutual friend who proved the crucial link, and the documentary is dedicated to himRecalling his brother’s death – more than 70 years later – Scotty sobs in the film.‘It runs through your mind quite often,’ he says. ‘You don’t forget things. Some people forget things, but I don’t.‘The bad things that happened were my brother, my daughter, Betty … I created happy things and making people happy to kind of compensate for the unhappy things. Do you think that’s possible?’Tyrnauer calls Scotty \u0027the most natural, unaffected person I’ve ever met.\u0027In terms of human relations … you know, they call it emotional quotient, emotional IQ? EQ. I mean, he’s just off the charts. He’s not only street smart, but his kind of sensitivity, his antennae for the way to deal with people and to create happy, soothing situations – no matter what the situation – is like nothing I’ve ever seen before.\u0027Having said that, these tragedies that have marked his life have a deep and lasting effect on him. And I think there’s that kind of rawness and emotion to his character that makes a really fascinating and poignant person to spend time with in the course of a 90-minute film.\u0027 By Scotty\u0027s side for the last nearly 35 years has been Lois, a singer he met in a bar in 1981 and married three years later. She hasn’t read his book, and she was a bit blindsided by a lot of his past he’d never really given her the full story before they married and, it seems, even for years afterward.‘I didn’t know him then,’ she says in the film. ‘I don’t know him as that person and not sure I want to – and I’m not interested in Hollywood shenanigans. I’m just not.’She directs her attention to her husband: ‘I guess I feel some regret that he didn’t say something before, when I first knew you, about your life, prior to my meeting you.’Lois, Tyrnauer says, \u0027was not on board\u0027 with the documentary.\u0027That took a lot of convincing,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com. \u0027She really was uncomfortable with the camera. It came to light almost immediately that Lois didn’t really know about Scotty’s past, at least in full detail, even though the book had been published. She made it very clear that she had not read the book and never would read the book, as you can see clearly in the film. We had to really work our way in with Lois.\u0027And over time, I think we got her on board - and I think she saw that we were taking a sensitive approach. And Im very grateful that she participated she\u0027s a huge part of the film ... from what I\u0027ve heard from the few people who\u0027ve seen the film at festivals so far, she\u0027s one of the favorites of the characters in the film.\u0027 She’s clearly worried (and seemingly a bit long-suffering) in the documentary, complaining about his hoarding and his continued attempts to do housework like roofing despite the fact that he’s over the age of 90. In one of the stranger bits of footage, Scotty takes out the ashes of his friend, actor and director Beech Dickerson, who left him three houses the ashes had been sitting for years in the trunk of a car, and Dickerson had requested they be scattered off the porch of Scotty’s hillside home.Scotty opted to dump them through a hole in the rotting wooden deck, which he then hosed down.‘They’ve asked me, why do I stay? Because I love him,’ Lois says in the film. ‘And somebody asked me, why? And I say, I don’t know … you just do – mainly because of the way he is: his sense of humor, his warmth, his caring.‘He likes to make people happy … it must be a chore to have to want everybody to be happy.’Over the years, critics have questioned the veracity of some of Scotty\u0027s claims, arguing that most people involved are dead so cannot refute the stories.  \u0027I did encounter some people who were in a tribe that I call The Doubters, and a lot of them became less doubtful after I presented t hem with all of the corroboration I had discovered,\u0027 Tyrnauer says. \u0027I think the movie provides a great deal of corroborating … and I’ll be curious to see how people, what people think after they see the movie if they were doubtful going in.\u0027I believe all of his stories. I checked them out they all check out, even some of the more outlandish ones, even some of the most outlandish ones check out very well. And I checked them with multiple sources and corroborating materials. I just wanted to also point out that no one has refuted the book, either, which came out in 2012.\u0027Most people he approached for interviews, he says, were only too happy to go on camera and talk about Scotty and his heyday.\u0027The reactions of everyone that I met through Scotty or around Scotty … I would say 98 percent were people who believed Scotty and were very believable themselves – and in many cases were corroborating,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com. \u0027And also, what really surprised me was that almost everyone approached to speak on camera had no hesitation to do so. \u0027And among these chiefly were men who were present at the beginning of Scotty’s story, which goes back to the 1940s, early 1950s – so these were gentlemen in their late 80s, early 90s, who were of a different generation, where perhaps they weren’t as comfortable to talk about things such as their own sexuality and the specter of prostitution. \u0027Many of these people identified as straight, not as gay, but they were willing to speak very openly, candidly, and in many cases, movingly, about this experience and this part of their lives – which basically revealed themselves to be either bisexual or homosexual, or whatever you want to call it. But it was really very moving to me, the lack of hesitation of people to participate.\u0027           Though he claims he set up celebrities over the course of at least 50 years, Bowers never said a word about any of the meetings until he wrote his memoir, Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars in 2012Scotty Bowers knew the Golden Age of Hollywood more intimately than anyone else. He says he set up Katharine Hepburn with up to 150 women over the course of 50 years was part of a three-way with Cary Grant and Randolph Scott, who he claims were lovers. Bowers\u0027 list goes on and on and many of his stories are recounted in a new documentaryAnd one thing that can’t be denied – regardless of the truth of his stories and claims – is the fact that Scotty, over the years, has become a legendary Hollywood institution in his own right. And there are many, many supporters and friends who are overjoyed that he has finally begun to share his stories, albeit so late in life.‘People get very angry at the idea of these beloved Hollywood icons being revealed to have secrets – but actually, all it is that Scotty’s doing is revealing that these people were real,’ Stephen Fry says in the film. ‘They were actual people, flesh and blood – like us.’ Tyrnauer didn\u0027t show Scotty the film until it was finished he teared up \u0027a few times and had the most elegant and forbearing comment about it, which was: The music\u0027s peppy and the words are peppy, too,\u0027 the director says.\u0027He\u0027s certainly  enjoying the victory lap of having a feature film about him in his 96th year in theaters.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/25/18/045ACC71000003E8-0-image-a-51_1532540513804.jpg","title":"First time buyers expect pay 13 times annual salary buy home London","story":"    First time buyers who want to buy in London must expect pay almost 13 times their annual salary to be able to afford to get on the housing ladder, shock figures reveal today          Housing Secretary James Brokenshire has insisted the Government is making progress on house building but it is still far short of its 300,000 a year target The latest \u0027affordability ratios\u0027 for home buyers shows the property market spiralling away as the Government continues to fall far short of its target to build 300,000 homes a year.The ratio is calculated by iding the average house price at the bottom end of the market by the typical earnings of 22 to 29 year-olds. In practice first time buyers who make it onto the ladder pay far less - an average of 4.3 times their salary - because banks rarely lend more than five times someone\u0027s salary.  Labour MP Fiona Onasanya is charged with perverting the...Overhaul of treason laws to target British jihadis should...Share this articleThe data shows that first-time buyers need 11.86 times their income in the South East and eight times their income in the East Midlands.The largest increase from 2016 to 2017 came in Conwy, Wales 15 per cent, followed by Camden in North London.

Khan studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating three years later. Promising a ‘new Pakistan’, Imran Khan’s election victory has resulted in claims of vote rigging by rivals and has drawn widespread media attention, something the former cricket captain and playboy is more than used to.As reported in the BBC, Imran Khan has transformed into a religious reformer but struggled to garner support after forming his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party in 1996, was the only candidate from his party to win a seat two years later.          Pakistani opposition leader of the Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) political party Imran Khan  speaksFor some, Imran became ‘Imran Khan’t’ and it took until 2013 for things to change and for his party to be taken seriously, when his party narrowly missed becoming the second largest in Pakistan. Today, he Khan will become the next Prime Minister of the nation.Prior to the election, the PTI held under 10 percent of the 342 seats in the National Assembly and will need to win a large number in the province of Punjab, which has over half of the 272 directly-elected seats. Imran Khan\u0027s cricket careerOn his return to Pakistan, Imran Khan secured a place on the national team and began touring, establishing himself as one of the fastest bowlers in the world. He peaked in 1982, the year when he got 62 wickets at 13.29 each - the lowest average of any bowler in Test history with a minimum of 50 wickets in a calendar year.          Imran Khan of Pakistan lifts the cricket World Cup after Pakistan beat England in the finalBefore playing his first Test match for Pakistan in 1992 against Sri Lanka, he achieved the all-rounder’s triple, which means that Imran secured 3000 runs and 300 wickets, in 75 tests and took a six-month break following his historic World Cup win against England in the same year.Imran retired from cricket after playing for two decades and soon became renowned as a playboy on the London nightclub circuit, although he claimed that he never drank alcohol or engaged in anything that would be deemed inappropriate for a conservative Pakistani Muslim, as the BBC reported.          Jemima Goldsmith, who married Imran Khan to become Jemima Khan pictured here in 1996Imran Khan wifeIn 1995 when Khan was 43, he married the 21-year-old daughter of Sir James Goldsmith, Jemima and although the marriage was dissolved in 2004, they had two sons. Their split was mutual and the pair still remain friends.Imran Khan remarried in 2015 to journalist Reham Khan, but this partnership only lasted a year. As The Guardian reported, after revealing that the former BBC weather presenter would be releasing a tell-all memoir on July 25, the day of the election, she had been harassed by her supporters.He wed again in 2018, this time to Bushra Watto, who has been described as his spiritual adviser and the reason why he has emerged as a pious character, as well as an established politician. However, many have accused Khan of making dramatic U-turns.      Imran Khan and the PTI partyOn Imran Khan’s profile, it states: His profile says: ‘The party has Islamic overtones and is inspired partly by Imran Khan’s renewed commitment to Islam.‘As a politician, his vision is to turn Pakistan into a just society, based on humane values, by creating an independent and honest judiciary that will uphold democracy, protect human rights and ensure the rule of law and, by promoting a merit-based system that provides equal opportunity for upward social mobility to the working classes.’Despite claims of ‘blatant rigging’ in what has been described as a pivotal general election for Pakistan, Khan was declared the winner, even though the official results have yet to be released by Pakistan\u0027s electoral commission. Chief Election Commissioner Sardar Muhammad Raza said: ‘These elections were 100 per cent fair and transparent,’ but did not confirm whether election authorities were in a position to release the official results.Rival party leader Shahbaz Sharif, brother of Nawaz Sharif, said on the day of the election: ‘What they have done has pushed Pakistan back 30 years...People will not bear it.’ After other parties also alleged fraud, including the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), it could cause problem when the PTI need to form a coalition.This comes after claims that there had been campaigns against the military in the ‘dirtiest’ election Pakistan has ever seen, because of the increase of extremist religious parties out in the open. Political analyst Azeema Cheema said it was ‘complete chaos’ and was ‘very concerned’.\u0027It depends on how the civilian disobedience is being organised. You may have spontaneous riots among political party workers. Then maybe political parties will organise sit-ins and demonstrations,\u0027 she said.Lyudmila Rudenko: Google Doodle celebrates the famous chess player Fortnite battle royale: Where to find clay pigeon shootingThe Warehouse Project announce 2018 lineup for the Manchester club\u0026#8217s final year on Store Street When is the Premier League back?

CLICK BELOW to see Facebook\u0027s stocks in real timeFacebook\u0027s second-quarter results were the first sign that  new European privacy laws and a string of privacy scandals involving Cambridge Analytica and other app developers are hitting the company\u0027s business.In midday trading Thursday, the company\u0027s market value (the number of outstanding shares multiplied by the value of a single stock), fell by more than $122 billion.That means that in one day, just the decline in Facebook\u0027s market value is roughly the entire market value of McDonald\u0027s or Nike, give or take a few billion. And it far exceeds to total market value of major U.S. multinational corporations such as General Electric, Eli Lilly or Caterpillar.But the company still has a total market value close to $511 billion, which exceeds the annual gross domestic product of countries like Poland, Belgium and Iran.The $15.8 billion in net worth that Zuckerberg stands to lose in the move is equal to the wealth of the world\u0027s 81st-richest person, currently Japanese businessman Takemitsu Takizaki, according to Forbes real time data. The tumbling stock prices comes as:The social media giant released its financial results on Wednesday reporting slower revenue growth in the second quarterShareholders filed a proposal to fire Zuckerberg as chairman of Facebook, citing \u0027mishandling\u0027 of scandals including user privacy and election meddlingFacebook executives defended hosting Fox News and \u0027atrocious\u0027 Infowars on its platform in a heated exchange with reportersThe parents of a Sandy Hook massacre victim begged Zuckerberg to remove hateful and harassing comments posted by conspiracy theoristsDescribing the announcements as \u0027bombshells\u0027, Baird analysts said the issues were to a large degree \u0027self-inflicted\u0027.Facebook executives made investors nervous on Wednesday in a call with analysts when they said profit margins would plummet for several years due to the costs of improving privacy safeguards and slowing usage in its biggest advertising markets.Chief financial officer David Wehner warned in the earnings call  that revenue growth had already \u0027decelerated\u0027 in the second quarter and would drop \u0027by high single digit percentages\u0027 in coming quarters.At one point during the call, Facebook shares were trading down as much as 24 percent, an unprecedented drop for a large firm. Until Wednesday, Facebook shares had been at record highs as investors seemed to shrug off fears about data protection and probes into the hijacking of private information by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.     The sharp decline eradicated about $128 billion off the company\u0027s value - or nearly four times the entire market capitalization of Twitter IncFor the second quarter, profit was up 31 percent at $5.1 billion revenues rose 42 percent to $13.2 billion, only slightly below most forecasts. Ad sales in Facebook\u0027s second quarter rose 42 percent to $13.04 billion but the costs, bolstered by moves to improve content and security after the data scandal, rose 50 percent from a year earlier to $7.37 billion. Facebook\u0027s monthly active user count was 2.23 billion, slightly behind the 2.25 billion forecast by analysts.

His first job in LA was at a gas station on Hollywood Boulevard, which soon became a hive of sexual activity          Scotty, now 95, with his wife, Lois they\u0027ve been married since 1984, and she says she had no idea about the extent of his social and sexual activities among the Hollywood elite when they got together. ‘I didn’t know him then,’ she says in the film. ‘I don’t know him as that person and not sure I want to – and I’m not interested in Hollywood shenanigans. I’m just not.’Scotty, now 95, eagerly recounts memories from his heyday as a ‘trick’ and facilitator for decades in Hollywood, showing off old pictures as well as reminiscing with some of the men he recruited or socialized with. He waited until all of the most famous players had passed away, however, before sharing their stories and publishing a tell-all book in 2012, Full Service.‘I often think back of how nice things were I can’t think back of any bad scenes or any bad things at all,’ Scotty says in the film. ‘So many people have said the nicest and best time of their whole life was that gas station. That’s why I felt good – that I made so many people happy.’He says: ‘When everyone was living, I would never even think, under any circumstances … no matter what anyone offered me, I wouldn’t write a book then.‘A lot of people at the time knew who these people were and what they were so, so it’s not a secret really,’ he tells one fan at a book signing. ‘It may be a secret for some square that lives in Illinois, but people who live in Hollywood? They knew these people.’When asked about his own sexuality, he answers: ‘I’m everything.’‘Scotty was pre-gay,’ Stephen Fry says in the film. ‘He himself doesn’t conform very particularly Scotty just breezes across all the fences that we erect to separate ourselves from others.’Director Tyrnauer had heard tales for years about the dual-function gas station before he actually met Scotty, he tells DailyMail.com. It was Tyrnauer\u0027s good friend Gore Vidal - to whom the documentary is dedicated - who eventually proved the crucial link.  \u0027One day he brought up the gas station, and he brought up the man behind it, Scotty Bowers,\u0027 he says. \u0027And I was astonished that Scotty was still around and that I had a personal connection to him. So at that moment, I decided this was my next film, almost sight unseen.\u0027Through Gore Vidal, I met Scotty I found out that he had finished the manuscript, which became his book ... And Scotty agreed to take part in the film, and we were off to the races.\u0027He adds: \u0027When I went to start filming Scotty, I discovered that there was a wife – and this astonishes a lot of people, that the leading male prostitute of his generation in Hollywood is married to a woman. And this just speaks to Scotty’s pansexuality.\u0027  Shocking moment girl throws milkshake and hits McDonald\u0027s staffMeghan gives Harry a kiss after handing out trophies at poloWoman throws chips and shouts abuse at McDonald\u0027s employeeFootage of man encouraging date to drive defective speedboatScooter rider dumps body of fatally stabbed teen in roadBystanders lift cleaning truck to free man stuck underneath itWorkman smashes car window to rescue three dogs on hottest dayMillionaire installs gates to block residents parking on trackDrivers queue for Eurotunnel in Folkestone in scorching heatTaxi driver pulls unconscious passenger into street and leaves himFootage appears to show boxer released after Hilton incident    Hunks in trunks: Scotty rang in his 90th birthday with a rather unusual cake delivered by scantily clad young men          Birthday boy: Scotty, now 95, celebrated his 90th birthday at LA\u0027s famous Chateau Marmont during the filming of the documentary           Bowers was raised in rural Illinois and served in the US Marines during World War II he says in the new documentary about his life: \u0027Many guys, when they got out of the service, they went back home again to the little town, to the farm I upgraded myself and went to Hollywood\u0027          Actor Walter Pidgeon met Scotty at the gas station and invited him home the encounter proved to be Scotty\u0027s entry into the sexual world of Hollywood starsWithin a matter of days after meeting Pidgeon, he says, word of mouth took off and his gas station became a hive of sexual activity.‘You couldn’t believe how busy I was I needed help,’ he says – so he recruited other men, even straight ones, telling them just to pretend they were having sexual liaisons with women if it helped them through it. Patrons of the station were charged $20 for each rendezvous.‘I was fixing every bit of 20 people a night, seven nights a week,’ he says in the film. He began to branch out from the gas station bathroom, letting other clients meet in a trailer that was kept on the property by one of his friends. When those were both busy, he could also arrange for discounted rooms at a nearby hotel where he knew the manager.He curried favour with George Cukor, the epicentre of the gay scene at the time who hosted debauched brunches each weekend with around a dozen of the most attractive men in Hollywood – where Scotty became indispensable.‘Scotty Bowers would always provide new talent,’ photographer Michael Childers says in the film, adding that ‘he wasn’t just this madame Cukor called for events he was also a friend.’Scotty segued into bartending, which helped with his ‘introduction’ service for the stars he had a common-law wife, Betty, and they eventually had a daughter, but Scotty was never home – speculating in the film that he might have taken Betty for a birthday dinner ‘once’ before the relationship broke down (which he fully blames on himself).Instead, he was out all days and at all hours, feeding the sexual demands of Hollywood at a time when stars were constrained by ‘morals’ clauses in their contracts. They couldn’t openly be gay or act on any non-mainstream proclivities, so Scotty arranged it all away from prying eyes.The list of A-list names in the film seems endless. Take, for instance, Randolph Scott and Cary Grant.‘I’d been with them inidually and both of them – what you call a three-way – and also I brought another buddy,’ Scotty says.‘Cole Porter would say, “Can you bring 15 guys?” … People have often said, you couldn’t have done that many things in a given week, fixing up that many people.’J. Edgar Hoover, May Davis, Laurence Olivier, Rock Hudson – he either hooked them up or participated himself, Scotty proudly claims. George Cukor’s estate factored into his dealings not just because of the director’s thriving gay social life but also because Hepburn and Spencer Tracy lived on the grounds – in separate cottages. For all appearances, the two performers were having an affair in reality, Scotty and other insiders insist, both were gay and they never actually lived together.‘She was a designer of her own legend, and she had several fervid relationships with talented other women,’ columnist Liz Smith says in the film. ‘She was very guarded about what she did.’‘George kind of told Katharine Hepburn early in the game what I did, in a way, and I could see running through her head: Well, if he fixes up guys, he should be able to fix up girls, too,’ Scotty says in the film. ‘I could see that. I fixed her up with every bit of 150 girls … over a period of 39 years. That’s almost 50 years that’s not unusual at all.’          Scotty, second from the far right, recruited other men for \u0027tricks\u0027 he hooked up with both genders and says, when asked about his sexual orientation: \u0027I\u0027m everything\u0027  Scotty claims to have had a three-some with Cary Grant, left, and Randolph Scott, right          Scotty says in the film that Katharine Hepburn\u0027s relationship with Spencer Tracy was for show and the actors never lived together he says that, when Hepburn was first informed about Scotty\u0027s activities, \u0027I could see running through her head: Well, if he fixes up guys, he should be able to fix up girls, too ... I fixed her up with every bit of 150 girls … over a period of 39 years\u0027He talks about his own relationship with Tracy, who would often drink until he was quite inebriated when the two were together.‘He’d get up and almost fall and put his arm around me and we’d go into bed,’ says Scotty, adding that, in the morning, the actor would ‘pretend nothing ever happened.’‘He really didn’t want to be gay or admit to himself he might possibly be, so the best way is not to admit it, right?’ Scotty says.And another couple he helped, he says, were actual royalty, not Hollywood royalty: Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson.‘When I took people to see Wally and Edward, I never told one person, even though they were close buddies,’ he says. ‘They were seen as Duke and Duchess.’He was recommended to them as a resource, he says, by photographer and designer Cecil Beaton – and the couple told him he came ‘highly recommended.’ He says Edward VII ‘liked to see guys and girls together and then sort of work his way in. If a guy wants to see a guy and a girl together, they’re usually gay or have a tendency to be gay – because if they were straight, why would they want the guy?’Wallis, he says, was ‘the one who’d do the talking … she was a real ballsy chick. But they thought what I did was the nicest thing that ever happened to them.’And when it comes to his own sexual proclivities and history, Scotty brags that he was a particularly interesting study for Dr Alfred Kinsey, the sexual research pioneer.‘When Dr Kinsey met me, he’d already heard about me that’s why he interviewed me about four, five, six times,’ he says, adding: ‘We became friends, and he liked to interview me. I was one of the only people that completed the interview from one end to the other, meaning you’ve done everything.’(That list of ‘everything’ included men, women and animals.)‘I got him not only the best interviews he had I took him to gang bang parties and things like that and put him in the f*****g bedroom and everybody f******, mainly guys,’ he says. ‘He’d be over there, and I’d crawl over to see if he had a hard-on, and he’d say: “Scotty, I’m just observing.”’‘Scotty did play an academic role in the sexual revolution, because he was the connective tissue between the academic, Kinsey, and the people who were doing it,’ says Peter Bart, former studio chief and former editor of Variety. ‘Scotty was a revelation to Kinsey.’Harry Styles struggling to sell opulent West Hollywood...From a Hollywood A-Lister, an eighties movie icon and a...Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio were among actors who TURNED...Share this articleMuch of the liberated and pleasurable antics that anchored Scotty’s world, however, took place against a backdrop of disapproval not just from studios but also from a legal and societal standpoint. Vice squads were out in force post World War II, and it wasn’t unusual for an effeminate inidual to get attacked on the street.One magazine, Confidential, was particularly aggressive about outing celebrities and spreading salacious stories – and it paid. Scotty says he was approached multiple times but always declined to confirm any stories, even true ones, that were floating around publication of such tales could easily end a star’s career.One of those stories, he said, happened at Frank Sinatra’s home in Palm Springs – ‘when I had a three-way with Ava Gardner and Lana Turner.’‘They were buddy-buddy, in those days,’ he says. ‘You know, they were a little stoned, and they were in the pool in the nude – and pretty soon, we’re in bed together. The word got around. ‘Confidential came to me with the story first I wouldn’t sign it.’Two others, however, ‘signed and went for the money.’  And when the advent of HIV and AIDS came about, everything changed – prompting Scotty to get out of the game. All of Hollywood was shocked and terrified, and Scotty talks in the film about how the survivors were simply winners in a game of luck.‘When AIDS came along, I thought, I’m going to pass on fixing people up, because I don’t want to be involved in that,’ he says in the film. ‘It’s a case where you just hope you don’t catch it.’It’s a topic he discussed frankly in his 2012 memoir, as well, writing: \u0027AIDS had launched itself in a vicious war against humanity. \u0027It brought an end to the sexual freedoms that had defined much of life in Tinseltown ever since the birth of the movies. I, too, underwent a major change. Tricking – whether for others or doing it myself – gradually slowed to a snail\u0027s pace. Sex used to be about having fun and a good time. The advent of AIDS didn\u0027t change that per se, but now sex could come at the cost of your very life. So, things changed. A lot.\u0027The wild and woolly days were over. The drag parties and gang bangs and swingers\u0027 evenings and orgies became a thing of the past. But life went on.\u0027Bowers’ own life, however, had seen its fair share of tragedy – which he acknowledges closer to the end of the documentary. His daughter, Donna, died at 23 after a botched abortion he points to her graduation photo and other pictures, her phone remains in one of his houses with the same number attached, and her clothes are still in her closet.He speaks of her sadly and fondly – though he admits that, as soon as he received news of her death, he continued working as the party facilitator that he was.‘Within an hour after I learned she died, I’m on the way to Malibu to a party with a carload of guys,’ he says. ‘I was 100 percent dependable, reliable … regardless of what it was.‘If I told someone I was going to be there, I’d be there. I never said anything to anyone about what had happened.’He was also, it turns out, carrying the tragic wartime death of his brother, Donald – who, though two years older, joined the Marines after Scotty. He was killed in 1945, one of nearly 7,000 American deaths at Iwo Jima.           Over the years, critics have questioned the veracity of some of Scotty\u0027s claims, arguing that most people involved are dead so cannot refute the stories. Documentary director Matt Tyrnauer says: \u0027I believe all of his stories. I checked them out they all check out, even some of the more outlandish ones, even some of the most outlandish ones check out very well. And I checked them with multiple sources and corroborating materials.\u0027          Scotty wrote a 2012 memoir, Full Service, detailing his sexual escapades and introductions he made for others he says he waited until the stars were dead to share their stories          Scotty says he secretly arranged trysts for Wallis Simpson and abdicated British king Edward VIII, claiming that \u0027they thought what I did was the nicest thing that ever happened to them\u0027          Director Matt Tyrnauer had heard tales of a dual-purpose gas station for years before he actually met Scotty Gore Vidal was a mutual friend who proved the crucial link, and the documentary is dedicated to himRecalling his brother’s death – more than 70 years later – Scotty sobs in the film.‘It runs through your mind quite often,’ he says. ‘You don’t forget things. Some people forget things, but I don’t.‘The bad things that happened were my brother, my daughter, Betty … I created happy things and making people happy to kind of compensate for the unhappy things. Do you think that’s possible?’Tyrnauer calls Scotty \u0027the most natural, unaffected person I’ve ever met.\u0027In terms of human relations … you know, they call it emotional quotient, emotional IQ? EQ. I mean, he’s just off the charts. He’s not only street smart, but his kind of sensitivity, his antennae for the way to deal with people and to create happy, soothing situations – no matter what the situation – is like nothing I’ve ever seen before.\u0027Having said that, these tragedies that have marked his life have a deep and lasting effect on him. And I think there’s that kind of rawness and emotion to his character that makes a really fascinating and poignant person to spend time with in the course of a 90-minute film.\u0027 By Scotty\u0027s side for the last nearly 35 years has been Lois, a singer he met in a bar in 1981 and married three years later. She hasn’t read his book, and she was a bit blindsided by a lot of his past he’d never really given her the full story before they married and, it seems, even for years afterward.‘I didn’t know him then,’ she says in the film. ‘I don’t know him as that person and not sure I want to – and I’m not interested in Hollywood shenanigans. I’m just not.’She directs her attention to her husband: ‘I guess I feel some regret that he didn’t say something before, when I first knew you, about your life, prior to my meeting you.’Lois, Tyrnauer says, \u0027was not on board\u0027 with the documentary.\u0027That took a lot of convincing,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com. \u0027She really was uncomfortable with the camera. It came to light almost immediately that Lois didn’t really know about Scotty’s past, at least in full detail, even though the book had been published. She made it very clear that she had not read the book and never would read the book, as you can see clearly in the film. We had to really work our way in with Lois.\u0027And over time, I think we got her on board - and I think she saw that we were taking a sensitive approach. And Im very grateful that she participated she\u0027s a huge part of the film ... from what I\u0027ve heard from the few people who\u0027ve seen the film at festivals so far, she\u0027s one of the favorites of the characters in the film.\u0027 She’s clearly worried (and seemingly a bit long-suffering) in the documentary, complaining about his hoarding and his continued attempts to do housework like roofing despite the fact that he’s over the age of 90. In one of the stranger bits of footage, Scotty takes out the ashes of his friend, actor and director Beech Dickerson, who left him three houses the ashes had been sitting for years in the trunk of a car, and Dickerson had requested they be scattered off the porch of Scotty’s hillside home.Scotty opted to dump them through a hole in the rotting wooden deck, which he then hosed down.‘They’ve asked me, why do I stay? Because I love him,’ Lois says in the film. ‘And somebody asked me, why? And I say, I don’t know … you just do – mainly because of the way he is: his sense of humor, his warmth, his caring.‘He likes to make people happy … it must be a chore to have to want everybody to be happy.’Over the years, critics have questioned the veracity of some of Scotty\u0027s claims, arguing that most people involved are dead so cannot refute the stories.  \u0027I did encounter some people who were in a tribe that I call The Doubters, and a lot of them became less doubtful after I presented t hem with all of the corroboration I had discovered,\u0027 Tyrnauer says. \u0027I think the movie provides a great deal of corroborating … and I’ll be curious to see how people, what people think after they see the movie if they were doubtful going in.\u0027I believe all of his stories. I checked them out they all check out, even some of the more outlandish ones, even some of the most outlandish ones check out very well. And I checked them with multiple sources and corroborating materials. I just wanted to also point out that no one has refuted the book, either, which came out in 2012.\u0027Most people he approached for interviews, he says, were only too happy to go on camera and talk about Scotty and his heyday.\u0027The reactions of everyone that I met through Scotty or around Scotty … I would say 98 percent were people who believed Scotty and were very believable themselves – and in many cases were corroborating,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com. \u0027And also, what really surprised me was that almost everyone approached to speak on camera had no hesitation to do so. \u0027And among these chiefly were men who were present at the beginning of Scotty’s story, which goes back to the 1940s, early 1950s – so these were gentlemen in their late 80s, early 90s, who were of a different generation, where perhaps they weren’t as comfortable to talk about things such as their own sexuality and the specter of prostitution. \u0027Many of these people identified as straight, not as gay, but they were willing to speak very openly, candidly, and in many cases, movingly, about this experience and this part of their lives – which basically revealed themselves to be either bisexual or homosexual, or whatever you want to call it. But it was really very moving to me, the lack of hesitation of people to participate.\u0027           Though he claims he set up celebrities over the course of at least 50 years, Bowers never said a word about any of the meetings until he wrote his memoir, Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars in 2012Scotty Bowers knew the Golden Age of Hollywood more intimately than anyone else. He says he set up Katharine Hepburn with up to 150 women over the course of 50 years was part of a three-way with Cary Grant and Randolph Scott, who he claims were lovers. Bowers\u0027 list goes on and on and many of his stories are recounted in a new documentaryAnd one thing that can’t be denied – regardless of the truth of his stories and claims – is the fact that Scotty, over the years, has become a legendary Hollywood institution in his own right. And there are many, many supporters and friends who are overjoyed that he has finally begun to share his stories, albeit so late in life.‘People get very angry at the idea of these beloved Hollywood icons being revealed to have secrets – but actually, all it is that Scotty’s doing is revealing that these people were real,’ Stephen Fry says in the film. ‘They were actual people, flesh and blood – like us.’ Tyrnauer didn\u0027t show Scotty the film until it was finished he teared up \u0027a few times and had the most elegant and forbearing comment about it, which was: The music\u0027s peppy and the words are peppy, too,\u0027 the director says.\u0027He\u0027s certainly  enjoying the victory lap of having a feature film about him in his 96th year in theaters.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/26/01/4E92301F00000578-0-image-m-39_1532564020898.jpg","title":"Sandy Hook parents write letter urging Facebook act against hoax theorists","story":"Leonard Pozner (left with Noah) and Veronique Pozner\u0027s (right) six-year-old son, Noah, died in the December 2012 Newtown shooting massacre          Noah Pozner, 6, was one of the victims of the massacre.

Twenty-seven wooden angel figures are seen placed in a wooded area beside a road near the Sandy Hook Elementary School for the victims of the shooting in 2012\u0027I also think that going to someone who is a victim of Sandy Hook and telling them, \u0027Hey, no, you\u0027re a liar\u0027 - that is harassment, and we actually will take that down,\u0027 Zuckerberg said.In a statement Wednesday in response to the letter by Pozner and De La Rosa, a Facebook spokeswoman said the company recognizes that victims of mass shootings and other tragedies are \u0027vulnerable to offensive and incendiary comments.\u0027\u0027Although we do see people come together on Facebook in very positive ways around tragedies, some of what we see is truly abhorrent and represents the worst of the internet and humanity,\u0027 the statement said. \u0027We don\u0027t allow people to mock, harass or bully the victims of tragedies.

And it far exceeds to total market value of major U.S. multinational corporations such as General Electric, Eli Lilly or Caterpillar.But the company still has a total market value close to $511 billion, which exceeds the annual gross domestic product of countries like Poland, Belgium and Iran.The $15.8 billion in net worth that Zuckerberg stands to lose in the move is equal to the wealth of the world\u0027s 81st-richest person, currently Japanese businessman Takemitsu Takizaki, according to Forbes real time data. The tumbling stock prices comes as:The social media giant released its financial results on Wednesday reporting slower revenue growth in the second quarterShareholders filed a proposal to fire Zuckerberg as chairman of Facebook, citing \u0027mishandling\u0027 of scandals including user privacy and election meddlingFacebook executives defended hosting Fox News and \u0027atrocious\u0027 Infowars on its platform in a heated exchange with reportersThe parents of a Sandy Hook massacre victim begged Zuckerberg to remove hateful and harassing comments posted by conspiracy theoristsDescribing the announcements as \u0027bombshells\u0027, Baird analysts said the issues were to a large degree \u0027self-inflicted\u0027.Facebook executives made investors nervous on Wednesday in a call with analysts when they said profit margins would plummet for several years due to the costs of improving privacy safeguards and slowing usage in its biggest advertising markets.Chief financial officer David Wehner warned in the earnings call  that revenue growth had already \u0027decelerated\u0027 in the second quarter and would drop \u0027by high single digit percentages\u0027 in coming quarters.At one point during the call, Facebook shares were trading down as much as 24 percent, an unprecedented drop for a large firm. Until Wednesday, Facebook shares had been at record highs as investors seemed to shrug off fears about data protection and probes into the hijacking of private information by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.     The sharp decline eradicated about $128 billion off the company\u0027s value - or nearly four times the entire market capitalization of Twitter IncFor the second quarter, profit was up 31 percent at $5.1 billion revenues rose 42 percent to $13.2 billion, only slightly below most forecasts. Ad sales in Facebook\u0027s second quarter rose 42 percent to $13.04 billion but the costs, bolstered by moves to improve content and security after the data scandal, rose 50 percent from a year earlier to $7.37 billion. Facebook\u0027s monthly active user count was 2.23 billion, slightly behind the 2.25 billion forecast by analysts.

These two are making ham and cheese sandwiches for the road’Murga is Argentinian street theatre that combines dance with percussion. The first time I heard the hypnotic drumbeat of a performance was in a park in Buenos Aires. I walked towards it and watched the dancers as they moved from the first simple steps to the intense high kicks the performances culminate in. I was hooked. I wanted to know everything about it.For ordinary, working class people, murga plays an important role. Austerity means it’s becoming much harder to live in Argentina. Murga gives them something to look forward to, an escape.Each area of Buenos Aires has its own murga group, with their own colours. In February, throughout carnival season, they travel from neighbourhood to neighbourhood on weekends, performing well into the night. They travel around in these knackered old school buses to makeshift stages on streets shut down for the evening. In some places, the audience is on fire, it’s exciting. There is a real buzz when the drums start. The sound is addictive the audience gets lost in it and even though it’s so hot and so late, the performers give it their all.I shot this in 2013, while trailing a local troupe I’d befriended a few years earlier. It was about 6.45 in the evening, and it was very hot, very humid. Everyone was moving a little slowly, which I think this picture captures. The troupe – about 150 dancers and drummers – had gathered at the director’s house, which transforms into a community centre of sorts.I came across this private moment in the kitchen. Someone had made stew for dinner, in that big pot, and two dancers were making ham and cheese sandwiches for the road. The boy had put the knife down to concentrate on talking to the girl. They were having an intense conversation. I liked how they were mirroring each other’s body language, unconsciously, beautifully. The composition reminded me of Dutch paintings.In the room next door, people were doing their makeup and making last-minute adjustments to their costumes – men with their coat-tails and smart hats, girls with short skirts. Elsewhere, others were loading drums into buses. I liked how this quiet, fleeting moment, stood in direct contrast to the flurry of activity all around. I went back the following year with printed copies of the image to give the boy and the girl, but they were no longer members. I never found out their names.Training: BA in fine art at Norwich School of Art and MA in contemporary art theory at Goldsmiths College, London.Influences: “Vermeer, Alessandra Sanguinetti, and many other photographers, artists and film directors.”High point: “Photographing Somaliland’s presidential elections recently for the NGO Saferworld.

WE has a different visionTwo years after the EU referendum, the men who have dominated our Brexit debate – from Boris Johnson to Nigel Farage – have discounted evidence that campaign irregularities and outright lies skewed the referendum. They have offered the sketchiest of plans and winked away impact assessments and forecasts. But their bombast can no longer conceal the truth before us: that Brexit will harm those with least, to whom it promised the most. In the face of such contempt from Westminster, I am therefore asking Women’s Equality party (WE) members to reshape our position on Brexit at conference in September.WE saw from the outset that the referendum was as much a vote on the establishment as it was on Brexit. So we campaigned for a feminist lens on whatever plan the end vote produced. WE understood that the European Union, though the source of key rights and protections for women, had form in excluding and marginalising too: female representation in the EU parliament is still only one-third and the institution is too focused on women who make it past structural barriers to the workplace, failing to protect those at the margins of ever freer market policies.Yet WE also recognised the huge damage that could be caused to women by Brexit, and which would likely bring an economic shock, cuts to the public purse and renegotiation over workplace protections. After the result, the government’s first deal was with the monstrous DUP to trade away reproductive rights in Northern Ireland for crunch votes in parliament. Martin Callanan, the Department for Exiting the European Union minister, advocated to scrap EU safeguards for workers and pregnant women. Politicians voted down our amendment to make sure parliament would scrutinise any rewriting of workers’ rights and equalities legislation. The false binary the vote pretended to represent is clear: this was never a choice between the establishment and the people, but between the opinions of two sets of privileged men, each nostalgic for a world in which women know their place. The PM may say she has hold of the negotiations, but her grasp is as slippery as the glass cliff upon which her male peers have placed her while they wait to claim her job.The Conservatives are in fact being steered by the European Research Group – a taxpayer-funded vehicle to do over taxpayers with the hardest possible Brexit – and Jacob Rees-Mogg, who says the World Trade Organisation model is nothing to be frightened of while he sets up EU-based investment funds. Their industrial strategy involves a bonfire of red tape – that convenient hyperbole for workers’ rights – and cuts to corporation tax and employers’ contributions. From “fuck business” to “fuck yeah, business” in one short step. The big short of Brexit night, when hedge funds cleaned up thanks to sterling’s shock fall, is likely nothing compared to the free-market free-for-all that awaits.Labour’s industrial strategy meanwhile prizes the creation of working-class men’s jobs above all else. Jeremy Corbyn’s focus on manufacturing is, in 2018, a slap in the face to millions of people – disproportionately women – employed in the service, retail and health sectors, where jobs and pay are falling. Investment in workforce strategies and free childcare would boost jobs and productivity far more than a focus on dwindling industries where investment will only speed further automation. His disdain for “cheap labour” is a dismissal of poor women, abroad and at home.The urgent need to do something different on our shores is emphasised by the arrival in Europe of Steve Bannon. “I would rather reign in hell than serve in heaven,” he told the Daily Beast, as he opened an office in Brussels to co-ordinate and fund Europe’s rightwing nationalist groups. It is shaming that Brexit is being held up to fascists as an example of what can be achieved as isolationism, protectionism and militarism take root around the world.Yet there is another way another chance. The real anti-establishment activists are heading for Brussels, where the extremes may be assembling but so too are the alternatives, supported by a voting system that enables new voices to win seats. WE is working with Sweden’s Feminist Initiative party, its leader, Gudrun Schyman, and Soraya Post (the first party member to be elected to the European parliament) to support their work to build a feminist bloc within Brussels alongside other developing feminist parties from Finland, Norway, Denmark and Spain.In this scenario, the case for remain is now about the dynamic assertion of our liberty, of a chance to climb into the ring with rabble rousers, of transforming the EU project from grey bureaucracy to a bright arena where we might protect and – finally – extend women’s rights to the benefit of all. Feminists could unite against the hellish Brexit vision of the right and the myopic Brexit of the left. Trade negotiations could be reset with human rights on an equal footing with the rights of shareholders. Immigration policy could be reset with an understanding of the global pay and education gap that counts against migrant women. Peace could transcend the drive towards further militarisation.I want to lead the way towards that option. Let’s not call it remain but rather “advance”: a third way out of this mess. Let’s build a movement of women and men from all corners and countries with the aim of equality and human rights for all.At our party conference in September, our members will have the opportunity to decide whether WE back a people’s vote, and part of that debate will be considering the case for advance. It is fitting therefore that our conference will take place in Kettering – the same place from which Vote Leave launched its campaign. They may Brexit. But WE can fix it.• Sophie Walker is the leader of the Women’s Equality party and a former Reuters journalist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4854eabf8be9787971efe64ea4228b89815272e8/0_230_5232_3139/master/5232.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d6b7187704372042f2b42cdcebd2ffa","title":"school exclusions zero tolerance policies disruptive pupils","story":"The education select committee this week claimed that rising rates of school exclusions amount to a “scandal”. MPs pointed the finger at several culprits for the growing number of children being temporarily or permanently excluded from school, most notably the rise of so-called “zero tolerance” behaviour policies.This approach, borrowed from the US, aims to reduce misbehaviour by lowering the tolerance teachers have for rule breaking. For example, if a student is late then they get a detention – no excuses, and no exceptions. Advocates of the policy claim that the increased certainty of sanction reduces the overall temptation to break the rules.Zero-tolerance policies have become more popular thanks to some schools that have vocally championed their use, such as the Michaela community school in north London and Magna academy in Poole. They are frequently criticised for being too inflexible and inhumane. But are they the smoking gun the committee thinks they are?The claim that these policies are responsible for more children being excluded from school has little evidence to support it, beyond the testimonies of some of those who gave evidence to the select committee. If there is a serious attempt to verify that claim, I haven’t seen it. Hearsay isn’t enough – and in the enormous ideological punch-up of education, it’s wise to be suspicious of anything that is claimed but not supported by evidence. No student was ever excluded for a one-off minor breach. Indeed, it remains hard for a student to be excluded: the most common reason remains persistent disruption, which, as any teacher will tell you, is no laughing matter. Zero tolerance is a red herring. The rise in exclusions is more likely to be explained by new rules that, from 2014, increased school autonomy over exclusions.It’s not a happy thing to see anyone excluded, but if we want to reduce exclusions, then we need to do so organically rather than synthetically. We mustn’t deter schools from excluding when they need to do so in order to preserve the safety and wellbeing of staff and students. We need to get better at creating whole school cultures that encourage positive behaviour. Far from zero-tolerance behaviour policies being a problem, when schools sweat the small stuff – offer clear guidance on good conduct, insist on calm, civil spaces, and help students feel valued as members of their school community – the need to exclude goes down.The select committee is right about one thing, though: we need more investment in better provision for excluded students. Some is superb in other areas it is nonexistent. Match that with better training in in-school behaviour management and you just might see the reduction in exclusions that everyone wants.The select committee report is called Forgotten Children, but the children it does end up forgetting are the vast majority of students who don’t tell teachers to go to hell, who don’t commit routine acts of violence against others, persistently bully terrified peers, or wilfully and continually disrupt the learning of others. To ignore the needs of all children and staff in schools is extraordinarily shortsighted, and almost callous by default.In all communities we balance as many needs and interests as we can, for the good of as many as possible. If the system is abused by a few schools, then we should address them rather than hobble the vast majority of schools and teachers working tirelessly for the good of their students.But that’s what happens when people who are unfamiliar with working in challenging classrooms and schools attempt to fix complicated problems with simple solutions. If we want to provide children with safe and supportive environments free from bullying, intimidation and discord, where teaching time is maximised, and if we want to protect teachers from assault, humiliation and stress, then the right to exclude must be maintained – and schools should be supported in doing so when they have tried their best to avoid it. Anything else is just another knife in the back for schools already struggling to cope with one of the hardest, most important jobs in the world.• Tom Bennett is a teacher, and the Department for Education’s independent adviser on behaviour in schools"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f2d4638eb335a7bfbd288212f74d712528b506d/0_189_2839_1703/master/2839.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79e6b65548975ee620b54b706f1de185","title":"the guardian view on pakistans elections imran khans real test is coming","story":"Imran Khan says that he has won the election in Pakistan, and is poised to fulfil his long-pursued ambition to lead the country. Projections give his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party a commanding lead, but opponents of the cricket star turned populist politician are unanimous in rejecting the outcome. Though the startling delay in results and reports of ballot-stuffing fuelled suspicion and anger, there had already been warnings of the dirtiest election in recent history.But even before the problems with casting and counting votes, Pakistan’s Independent Human Rights Commission had warned of “blatant, aggressive and unabashed attempts to manipulate” the outcome, mostly through intense pressure on the media and the intimidation of candidates. While the military denies it has intervened in favour of Mr Khan, no one doubted its determination to see off the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. Though the jailing of its leader Nawaz Sharif followed revelations in the Panama Papers, his supporters were not alone in seeing selective prosecution or suggesting that his greater offence was pushing back against the military.But Mr Khan has also benefited from voters’ frustration with years of corruption and dynastic politics dominated by the PML-N and the Pakistan Peoples party (now headed by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, son of the assassinated Benazir Bhutto, the PPP seems to be positioning itself for the next contest). Mr Khan promises a new Pakistan, and has certainly reinvented himself. In the west, he is still seen as a cosmopolitan playboy in Pakistan he has wooed the religious right, vowing to defend the blasphemy law and describing the Taliban’s fight in Afghanistan as a “holy war”. He has portrayed himself as the outsider who will clean up a dirty business, despite his elite background and reliance on “electables” who bring their own vote banks as they switch between parties. There was some relief at his conciliatory tone as he claimed victory. But his campaigning record is not encouraging, and now he must actually run a country – in so far as he is allowed to. His party has governed one province. He takes over a country struggling with violence, extremism, poverty and a worsening economic situation, in a fraught international environment a mightier China, tense relations with the US, India and Afghanistan. Whatever he does will be done within the context of a strengthened military. He claimed the country’s “umpires” would step back if he were elected. But Mr Khan’s promised “New Pakistan” seems likely to look rather like the old variety."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bf4caf529a18d827898ca6f25e4096f90453802/126_340_3240_1944/master/3240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=046113a4595cc7db7b7e3c052d9985ec","title":"chinas long game to dominate nuclear power relies on the uk","story":"Approval of Chinese nuclear technology in the UK would act as a springboard to the rest of the worldChina wants to become a global leader in nuclear power and the UK is crucial to realising its ambitions.While other countries have scaled back on atomic energy in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, state-backed Chinese companies benefit from the fact that China is still relying on nuclear energy to reach the country’s low-carbon goals.“China is going in the opposite direction. The massive experience possessed by the Chinese nuclear industry, consistently building for the past 30 years and adopting various next-generation technologies, is being recognised by the global nuclear industry,” said Zaf Coelho, the director of Asia Nuclear Business Platform, based in Singapore.But the depth of CGN’s existing involvement in UK nuclear may surprise some.It was that Chinese ownership of a strategic piece of infrastructure that led Theresa May to temporarily halt the signing of the crucial subsidy deal for Hinkley when she became prime minister.Isabel Hilton, the CEO of Chinadialogue.net, said the UK opening up vital infrastructure to China was without parallel in the western world. “No other OECD country has done this. This is strategic infrastructure, and China is a partner but not an ally in the security sense.“You are making a 50-year bet, not only that there will be no dispute between the UK and China, but also no dispute between China and one of the UK’s allies. It makes no strategic sense.”The UK has appeared amenable to Chinese investment, though recently the UK cybersecurity watchdog warned British telecommunications companies against dealing with Chinese tech firm ZTE. One expert acknowledges that security concerns are a potential check to Chinese ambitions. Zha Daojiong, a professor of non-traditional security studies at Peking University, said: “The question is not whether your nuclear technology is safe or not, it’s a question of politics. To be blunt, most countries think: ‘Anybody but China.’ This kind of thinking is becoming more and more popular among western countries. It’s a serious problem.”While Germany and other western countries have turned their backs on nuclear, the UK is strongly committed to new nuclear to meet its carbon goals and this means, despite security concerns, the government needs Chinese involvement.Robert Davies, the chief operating officer of CGN UK, said: “The UK is open to investment, and we want to invest in clean energy in this country.”He is acutely aware of the need for future plants to be cheaper, given criticism over the cost of the EDF subsidy deal. “We understand the cost of electricity has to fall significantly from Hinkley Point,” he said.But the company is open about the bigger prize – the UK as a springboard for exporting Chinese nuclear technology to other countries. Asked if the UK should be concerned about China owning its nuclear power stations, he said: “We are not surprised and see nothing wrong with governments questioning our rationale for investing in their country.”For now, the company’s UK footprint is small – just 70 of its 44,000 staff are based here. But his hope is the firm will become viewed “not as an outsider that has come in, but part of the furniture”.China’s commitment was on show at a recent lavish nuclear industry event in London. No expense was spared on hosting the summit at the prestigious Guildhall building, where the Chinese ambassador to the UK told jokes and argued the case for new nuclear.Mycle Schneider, a Paris-based nuclear industry analyst, said cost was not an issue for Beijing because the Chinese are playing a long game. “It was clear quite early on there was a strategy to make the UK a platform … A few billion here or there is not the point. It’s about strategic assets.”But he said CGN still had a lot to learn about how the UK worked. “China does not have any building experience in any countries other than Pakistan, and that is not really comparable to the UK.”Zhou Dali, a former Chinese energy official, as director of the energy research institute of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, said: “We are learning how to do business with patience. Because you cannot force others to do something. You can only help. “We will give more and more information about the technology’s improvements, but the final decision will be made by the UK people and your politicians.”Additional reporting by Wang Xueying"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/336d9c61f97757f08c3ad49ac292be5570cbaed5/2_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16ec65fd85f5745c3da0996abbc107e1","title":"the bright side why women fell out of love with black","story":"For decades it has been synonymous with timeless chic – but now joyful, attention-grabbing colours are pushing it out of the wardrobeNew Yorkers do it. Parisians do it. Fashion types, Swedes and architects do it. In fact, name any stylish tribe and you’ll find that they do it. Wear black, that is – a colour that has come to signify so much: rigour, elegance, sex appeal, piety, formality, slenderness, even wickedness.Recently, however, black’s supposedly timeless status as the go-to hue for the chic has been thrown into the shade. And maybe that is no bad thing.Scroll through any British fashion website today and a rainbow of colour beams out. The breadth of shades feels remarkable: Topshop sets out its stall with a parrot-green silk skirt, a lemon coat and an azure trouser suit. At Boden, it’s all tomato-red cardigans and spotty cerise frocks. At Zara, there are russet and emerald tartans and rollneck jumpers in highlighter pen yellow and candy pink.Yes, Britain is in the midst of a heatwave, but this is no seasonal aberration. For months, the fashion news agenda has been hijacked by colour, seen everywhere from Amal Clooney’s dandelion-yellow royal wedding frock to Janelle Monáe’s so-called “vagina” trousers (pink, of course).Black is not dead, but Florence Allday, Euromonitor International’s analyst, predicts it will become an “increasingly smaller proportion of retailers’ product offering”, thanks to shifts in our lifestyles. “Now your office can be anywhere, the boundaries between formalinformal, workhome, onlineoffline are blurring,” she says. “Colour is no longer seen as frivolous, eccentric or inappropriate.”Colour is going nowhere for autumn, when the trends set to trickle down from the catwalk include neon and hi-vis. And this is not just for the very young or achingly hip: the philosophy behind John Lewis’s biggest womenswear relaunch in decades, on sale in September, is about using colour as a means for expressing iniduality, with most items available in up to four hues.The professionally seen-and-not-heard have used colour cannily for decades. The Queen, for one, dresses brightly to ensure visibility. Recently, she has noticeably ramped up the intensity, dabbling in head-to-toe lime green and shocking chartreuse.Such expert tricks are becoming part of civilian wardrobes, too, thanks to social media, and what Smith describes as “millennial peacocking”. She says: “It’s the fastest way to stand out on an endlessly updating feed.”Instagram stars are virtuoso colourists. The Danish street style star Pernille Teisbaek, for example, is an icon for what passes as understated chic now. Although monochrome makes up a significant part of her feed, she uses colour when it counts. On the cover of her recent book, Dress Scandinavian, for example, she wears mustard trousers, a canary-coloured jacket and a T-shirt with the word “yellow” over a picture of a bunch of bananas, an image which kills dead the idea of navy-and-cream Scandi minimalism.As the internet threatens the future of the traditional high street, the niche brands flourishing online have colour at the centre of their business plans. Kitri, for example, has seen products such as its £145 grass green Gabriella dress go viral. When the company launched, in March 2017, founder Haeni Kim says: “There was more of that traditional retail sense of putting more quantity behind neutrals. Now, we have started phasing out neutral colours, which is very unlike the traditional rules.” Bright colours, she says, “make people feel special. They get such amazing compliments. They photograph well on our website, and also stand out when customers take photographs of themselves. We are living in a very photographed world.”Even vampires don’t wear much black these days, according to Susie Cave, the wife of musician Nick, whose label, the Vampire’s Wife, has quickly captured the fashion zeitgeist. The brand’s name, which was always meant to be ironic (“You know, my husband has been held hostage by the Prince of Darkness thing for years,” she says), might suggest a Morticia Addams palette – but the emphasis is on peaches-and-cream florals and deep shimmering greens.“I think the world in which we live as women has become so isive, so bloodthirsty, so vindictive and puritanical that women want to exist beyond these reductive influences, and colour is one way of doing this,” says Cave. “Colour has a huge positive psychological impact – it is a shout of iniduality – and I think women want some life and wonder and joy and wildness in their lives and colour gives them that.”Cave is far from alone in using emotional language about colour. In fact, one of the most fascinating shifts in our approach to colour is the way we talk about it. In the 90s, colour analysis meant finding out if you were “cool autumn” or a “warm spring” in order to buy a jumper that would make your eyes sparkle. Now, colour chat rarely mentions appearance, but is about politics, identity and mood.In 2016, the term “millennial pink” was coined to describe a shade said to encapsulate the moment’s “ambivalent girliness”. Since then, as the fashion blog ManRepeller wrote in May, colour has become clickbait. Other shades with catchy names – among them “Gen Z yellow” and “melodramatic purple” – have also been briefly posited as generation-defining, while bright colours are increasingly used for protest, from pink pussy hats to calls to wear red for International Women’s Day, or green for Grenfell or orange for gun safety.WGSN’s colour director, Jane Boddy, believes we are all increasingly aware of “how colour connects us, as human beings, and how we use it as a tool to define us”. Certainly, a fascination with something as digestible as colour makes sense when the news agenda is so tangled and baffling, thanks to Brexit and Trump.We may be living through the most visual era ever. But at least fashion experts are no longer urging women to wear black clothing to look thinner or less distracting in the workplace.Issues of class and gender swirl around black dresses like clouds of chiffon. Black has been linked with money and taste since the 1500s. In the Victorian era, it was a signifier of mourning, and scandalously worn by women of loose morals in paintings, including Manet’s A Bar at the Folies-Bergère and John Singer Sargent’s Madame X. The pivotal moment, however, for black as we know it was Coco Chanel’s little black dress, a simple, long-sleeved, straight-up-and-down shift hailed, on a 1926 Vogue cover, as the fashion equivalent to Ford’s Model T, “a sort of uniform for all women of taste”.The reality of Chanel’s LBD was far less progressive than the mythology suggests. According to Shelley Puhak, writing in the Atlantic: Chanel’s innovation was an appropriation of servant’s uniforms, part of the luxurious poverty – “la pauvreté de luxe” – trend “reserved exclusively for those who could ‘afford’ to look poor by pretending that they simply couldn’t be bothered with fashion. But on closer inspection, there would be some small detail in her seemingly anonymous garment – a certain cut or fabric or label – that acted as a secret handshake for those in the know.” Plus ça change.Little black dresses have since become a cultural totem. They can launch careers (Liz Hurley and her safety pins) and wreak revenge (Princess Diana at the Serpentine Gallery party in 1994). Their icons are usually very sharp and very thin. The patron saint is Audrey Hepburn in a black Givenchy shift in Breakfast at Tiffany’s or a black beatnik rollneck in Funny Face. Other notable black dress icons include the quartet of grumpy glamazons in the video for Robert Palmer’s Addicted to Love.Black is not very friendly. So many of the aphorisms that exist about the shade have a hectoring tone: “A woman without a little black dress, has no future,” said Coco Chanel. Black, according to the Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto, says: “I don’t bother you. Don’t bother me!” Karl Lagerfeld, of course, thinks wearing black is much safer than dressing according to your own terrible taste. “If you’re wearing black, you’re on sure ground.” And behind it all is the pernicious idea that black matters because, as Christian Dior put it: “It is the most slimming of all.”So, is black a feminist issue? Susie Orbach says black has been “coded” as elegant, but often this really means slimming. “You could go back to Breakfast at Tiffany’s, the image of the gamine, cute sophisticate in the black dress. What’s in that is skinny, which, of course, has been absolutely critical to the representation of femininity for years.”At a time when body image issues are worse than ever, according to Orbach, dancing on black’s grave is probably not merited. “There is no bloody difference when you are talking about clothing,” she says. “It’s still about: ‘How do I represent myself?’ There is always an internal eye that’s judgmental, whether the current trend is that you need to stand out, rather than look svelte and sophisticated. It’s the same thing, just a different version of it. It strikes me as a wish too far, frankly.”Naomi Wolf, the author of The Beauty Myth, is a little more optimistic. “If women are embracing colour, it suggests that they are confident they can be taken seriously without wearing black,” she says. “If people aren’t choosing clothes primarily to appear smaller, I think that’s really politically important. It says: ‘I’m here and I’m not ashamed.’ It’s very non-apologetic.” And that’s an argument that I can buy into. After all, we may as well look on the bright side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/763414374ef48fec817a7231291d65acf2e355fc/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1d94450763f17ed5dd818154892b2cd","title":"tommy hilfiger new clothing line monitor customers","story":"Tommy Jeans Xplore items contain a bluetooth chip that will also track customers’ locationClothing stores have long employed all kinds of sneaky behaviour to make you want buy their products. The store assistants tell you you look fantastic in everything, the changing mirrors make you look skinnier, they play music that encourages people to make more purchases. Then often when you get home, those trousers don’t look so good after all, and they stay at the back of your closet forever more.Tommy Jeans, part of the Tommy Hilfiger brand, believe they can solve this part of the problem. Their new line, Tommy Jeans Xplore, will contain smart-chip technology that will track how often customers wear the clothes. Tommy Jeans will offer rewards and experiences, including gig tickets and gift certificates, to people that wear their clothes often enough (presumably some rewards will be even more wear-tracking items).Tommy Jeans says that by tracking users’ clothes-wearing habits they will be creating a “micro-community of brand ambassadors”.The collection includes hoodies, T-shirts, jeans and a denim skirt as well as bags, backpacks and hats. Every item is fitted with a bluetooth chip that can be linked to an Xplore app to start collecting “rewards”. As well as rewards for just wearing the clothes, bonus credits will be awarded for walking past special Tommy Jeans locations, which will be displayed on the app. So you could put the jacket on and then travel across town so that you can tell your jacket you’ve gone to where it told you to go.Tommy Hilfiger representatives said that the data they receive will be encrypted and wearers will be able to turn off the chip’s functionality at any time using the app – so perhaps that will make people feel better about wearing a baseball cap that knows where it is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94c36ca94237460c56c6d6dc590e5eee9fb76942/336_108_4199_2521/master/4199.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6f65dcab33d42933c4363fbff4dd311","title":"maestro pep guardiola sweet tune smooth operators","story":"Few people know the secrets behind Pep Guardiola’s managerial success as well as Domènec Torrent, who worked as the Spaniard’s assistant at Barcelona\u0026nbspB, with the Catalan club’s first team, at Bayern Munich and finally at Manchester City before, after 11 years, leaving his mentor’s side this summer to take over at New York City. This week Torrent offered a glimpse inside Guardiola’s tactical bunker.“Pep loves music in general and I am the same,” he said. “When we worked in the office we always had music on. Not rock music. Just something relaxing, maybe Sade.”This could be the least surprising musical revelation in the history of football. For a start, since taking over at the Etihad Stadium Guardiola has led the team on two pre‑season tours of America, the latest of which sees them play Bayern Munich in Miami on Sunday. Over successive summers Guardiola has literally taken his team coast to coast, LA (where they played Real Madrid last year) to Chicago (where they lost 1-0 against Borussia Dortmund last Saturday), and across the north and south to Key Largo. This is a manager who hasn’t just listened to Smooth Operator, Sade’s 1984 hit, he has dedicated himself to turning its lyrics into reality.Guardiola is not the first manager to schedule pre‑season trips to America around his favourite music, John Gregory having memorably organised Aston Villa’s visit to New York in 1999 to coincide with a concert by his favourite singer, Bruce Springsteen.But there was little of the Boss’s music to be found in Gregory’s team, little of his workaholic, anthemic brilliance in the Villans’ creditable march to a sixth-place finish the following season. For all his ability late-career Paul Merson was not exactly born to run. City’s debt to Sade runs deeper, being somehow evident even on the pitch, in the life of their midfield diamond and the way Guardiola has cajoled his players to move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy.In his famous “symphonic fairy tale” Peter and the Wolf, Sergey Prokofiev used different orchestral instruments to represent each character. “The role of each animal or bird will be played by a single instrument,” Natalia Satz, the director of Moscow Children’s Theatre who commissioned the piece in 1936, remembered the composer saying. “The characters’ iniduality will be expressed in the timbres of different instruments, and each of them will have a leitmotiv.” If a similar trick were to be attempted with current football teams, Guardiola’s City side could be perfectly represented by Smooth Operator’s opening saxophone solo: classy, seductive, technically flawless, wildly popular, ludicrously successful.It is a world away from the rock ’n’ roll football that is attempted by his more prosaic peers. While at Besiktas, Slaven Bilic was asked whose music his team most resembled. “Let’s think … not the Doors, not the Beatles. Pink Floyd? The team is as talented as Pink Floyd but no, we are not Pink Floyd,” the Croat replied. “I think we are Iron Maiden. Like Iron Maiden, we play with very high energy and everyone does their jobs very well.” Sadly, also like the British rockers, their output was wildly unpredictable, and after two seasons Bilic was on his way.City fans have seen before how the music managers listen to can have an effect on the way their teams play. Between 2005 and 2007 they had a manager in Stuart Pearce who banned R’n’B from the dressing room and replaced it with the Sex Pistols, whose aggressive anthems he played at full volume in the hope that his players would take to the field pumped with adrenaline and ready to fight their way to victory. Under his watch Ben Thatcher, a full-back who played as if flaying about in a perpetual solo moshpit, was banned for eight matches after knocking Portsmouth’s Pedro Mendes unconscious with a viciously wielded elbow. Pearce then conjured perhaps history’s most inappropriate supportive turn of phrase when amid the ensuing furore he declared that Thatcher was feeling extremely contrite. “I can assure everybody,” he said, “this has hit the player very hard.”Towards the end of his playing career Pearce was at Newcastle when their then manager Ruud Gullit had to\u0026nbspmake it a club rule that the left-back never be allowed near the stereo. “You\u0026nbspcannot think properly about the\u0026nbspgame ahead with so much noise going on around you,” Gullit said of the player’s terrible tunes. “Before a game you should want to talk to one another about what each of you will be doing. You cannot have a big ghetto‑blaster like that playing when you should be talking about the job ahead. The music distracts you. So,\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspme, there was nothing to\u0026nbspdiscuss. I\u0026nbsphave taken the machine away.”He might have turned the high-tempo thrashings of Pearce’s pet punks into Newcastle’s sweatiest taboo, but Gullit wouldn’t dream of taking the machine away from Guardiola. The Dutchman likes music that can suitably soundtrack the “sexy football” he so famously aspired to, and once spent an entire holiday driving around Portugal while listening to a particular artist. “I’ll never forget the endless Sade tapes,” he recalled. “It is now among my favourite music.”The greatest test of the similarity between Guardiola’s work and that of the musician who soundtracks it cannot yet be completed. It remains to be seen if the Spaniard will still be admired and influential three decades from now, but you can be damn sure that’s what football’s smoothest operator is anticipating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b94abc75407ba6508028c6fbc55b88aa682d0791/0_250_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b12eac68179d7a5451f43e9e5394bd28","title":"household debt in uk worse than at any time on record","story":"British household finances among most indebted in major western countries, ONS saysBritish households spent around £900 more on average than they received in income during 2017, pushing their finances into deficit for the first time since the credit boom of the 1980s. The Office for National Statistics said the shortfall amounted to nearly £25bn – equal to almost a quarter of the NHS budget – and the overspend was mostly paid for with borrowed money, though households also ran down savings.The figures pose a challenge to the government, which was warned last year that Britain’s consumer credit bubble of more than £200bn was unsustainable. A dramatic rise in debt-fuelled spending since 2016 has also taken place against the backdrop of the Brexit vote, which triggered a rise in inflation at a time of weak wage growth.Analysts warned that a squeeze on household incomes from benefit cuts, lacklustre wages and high inflation would continue to force poorer households to borrow more to pay basic bills.Tom Selby, a research analyst at financial adviser AJ Bell, said the figures presented ministers with a significant challenge as they sought “to build financial resilience in the UK”.Researchers at the ONS said the situation was worse than at any time on record after the £25bn deficit last year surpassed the £300m deficit recorded in 1988. British household finances also slumped from being among the most solvent in the 1990s to being among the most indebted compared with households in other major western countries.Last year official data showed unsecured credit – such as credit cards and payday loans – climbed to a record high of more than £205bn while the consultancy PwC said its own measure showed consumer debts rising above £300bn.The ONS said households took out nearly £80bn in loans in 2017, the most in a decade. But they deposited just £37bn with UK banks, the least since 2011. Households accumulated more debt than they acquired in assets even when their investments in bonds, shares and pensions were included.Anti-poverty charities warned that millions of low income households were the worst affected. StepChange, which provides advice for indebted households, said the poorest were in constant need of credit to keep their heads above water.The charity’s chief executive, Phil Andrew, criticised the ONS for saying that households were living beyond their means, which he said implied they could cut back if they wanted to. “It’s really unfortunate that this very useful data is so heavily sprinkled with the phrase that households are ‘living beyond their means’. The reality is that too many households, here in Britain, in 2018, simply cannot make ends meet, however hard they try.”He added: “Not having enough money to make ends meet is not the same thing as living beyond your means – which implies you have a choice, when too many people do not.”The ONS said a rise in interest rates, expected to be pushed through by the Bank of England next week, could encourage greater saving and an improvement in household finances.But AJ Bell’s Selby said: “For people having to borrow to make ends meet, saving for the future might feel like a luxury they simply cannot afford.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67096c910ea244771676e0ef86120b6e0c7b453e/0_8_3564_2139/master/3564.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a111a25793c5d995329438eaf101a508","title":"it felt like wed got the golden ticket paul mccartney plays cavern club","story":"Beatles fans tune into Twitter to find ticket location of McCartney’s gig at Liverpool venueGordon Smith was visiting his brother in Manchester on Wednesday night when he first saw rumours online that there was to be a secret Paul McCartney gig at Liverpool’s Cavern club the next day. By about 8am on Thursday, the 21-year-old student from Edinburgh, and Beatles mega-fan, was waiting in line outside the venue for a ticket.He joined the queue behind people who had camped out overnight to get a chance to see the former Beatle, who is 76, perform in the venue famous for being the birthplace of Beatlemania. At 9am, McCartney’s official Twitter account announced that 200 tickets for the 2pm gig would be available for free on a first-come, first-served basis at the Echo arena – a 15-minute walk away – not the Cavern club, as many had presumed.“I heard a man shout behind me,” said Smith. “I didn’t hear what he said, but I saw a bunch of people running off and leaving the queue.” He asked a group piling into a taxi where they were going and they told him they were going to the arena. “I’m not a sports person, but I ran as fast as I could from the Cavern club to the Echo arena and I managed to get a ticket, luckily.”Others weren’t so fortunate. Emma Ley wrote on Twitter that she had waited outside the Cavern club for about 10 hours overnight only to hear they were being given out at the arena. “I got there five minutes too late,” she wrote. “Gutted is an understatement. I’m not even happy for people with tickets. I’m sad and tired.”McCartney’s surprise gig comes days after he appeared on the crossing at Abbey Road made famous by the Beatles’ album cover, and as he prepares to go on tour, including dates in Liverpool, Glasgow and London in December.The original Cavern club opened in a warehouse cellar on Liverpool’s Mathew Street in 1957 and the Beatles are thought to have performed there nearly 300 times in the early 1960s. The club closed in 1973 and the cellar was filled in as part of the construction of the Merseyrail underground system. In the 1980s the club was rebuilt using many of the original bricks and reopened in 1984. This is only the second time McCartney has performed at the Cavern club since the 1960s the first was a gig in 1999 which was turned into the film Live at the Cavern Club.Waiting patiently in line to enter the Cavern club about 1pm on Thursday were Paul and Tina Magee, civil servants in their 50s. They’d been on their way to work when a parking attendant told them that free tickets to the concert were available at the arena. The couple arrived to find only about 30 people in line. “It felt like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, like we’d got the golden ticket,” said Paul.Helen Brown, 37, had been in a cab on her way to join the queue outside the Cavern club when she saw on Twitter that tickets would be given out at the arena. “I erted the taxi and when I got out I just threw loads of money at him and didn’t even wait for the change. I just legged it,” she said. “If I’d been caught at one red light, I would have missed out.”“As time goes on you realise how much the Beatles influenced everything,” she said. “They changed things culturally, socially, musically. I grew up here with parents from Liverpool, who saw the Beatles in the 60s and went to the Cavern club, so this is me getting a little bit of that action ... There’s also a feeling like there might not be many more chances to see him perform again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/693587b4aa9c09220865c177187dad4cd6eb1862/263_589_1774_1064/master/1774.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6229155ee4ca965e5859e159ed97288","title":"paul mccartney review secret gig cavern club liverpool","story":"Cavern, LiverpoolClassic Beatles songs come along like buses during this jolly surprise gig at the club synonymous with BeatlemaniaAlthough Paul McCartney became, in 1964, the last Beatle to move away from his home town, lately he doesn’t seem to be able to keep away from the place. Last month he played an impromptu gig at the Philharmonic Dining Rooms pub on Hope Street, where he entertained disbelieving drinkers with Fab Four and Wings classics. Then – for a special edition of the Late Late Show With James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke – he nipped to his teenage home on 20 Forthlin Road, where he wrote songs with John Lennon – and bashed out When I’m Sixty-Four. Now, here is he again, with a secret gig at the Cavern.This isn’t – quite – the building that triggered the start of Beatlemania, and thus effectively the birthplace of the most famous rock’n’roll quartet in history. The original Cavern was flattened to make a car park before being rebuilt in the 1980s. But nobody here is splitting hairs. Beatle Paul is back on Mathew Street and the 300 people crammed into this sweltering little club are almost close enough to touch a living Beatle.“Liverpool! Cavern! Two words that go together,” he begins, although some things have changed. He’s halfway through Eddie Cochran’s Twenty Flight Rock (the song with which he auditioned for John Lennon in 1957) when he stops it to admonish people filming on mobile phones. “It’s purrin’ me off,” he says, sounding more Cilla than Macca, but moments later, a storming version of Magical Mystery Tour – with the crowd on impromptu backing vocals – offers the first taste of what they came for.In truth, the setlist is a bit magic, a bit mystery as it careers from post-Beatles combo Wings’ big hits (Jet and Band on the Run), well-chosen album tracks (Wings’ Let Me Roll It), Beatle reggae (Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da), unexpected gems (pre-Beatle band the Quarrymen’s In Spite of All the Danger), lesser-loved solo songs (Hi, Hi, Hi) and a chunk from his forthcoming album, Egypt Station, which this filmed shebang is promoting. Who Cares is more pedestrian than its subject – bullying. But the keyboard-driven Valentine (an unashamed, unconditional love song for McCartney’s third wife, Nancy) is really lovely. At 76, he’s suddenly singing about sex as playfully as a young Beatle. Come on to Me is cheeky. The piano stomping on Fuh You is rather naughty. “A woman at the American label said it would be too much for the religious bodies,” he quips. “I said, ‘Fuh her.’”The songs are interspersed with crowd banter (“Chuck ’im out”), dollops of emotion (“It’s amazing for me, being back”) and dips into a very deep well of anecdotes. There’s one about the time the fledgling Beatles clubbed together £5 to make one copy of their own single and each kept it for a week. There is another from their first show at the Cavern, then a blues club, when the furious owner handed them a note reading: “We don’t play rock’n’roll in here.” Beatles songs come along like buses – an All My Loving here or Lady Madonna there. Things We Said Today is beautifully, magically reflective. Get Back sees him being told, “Get back to where you once belonged” by 10 rows of vocal scousers. Love Me Do and I Saw Her Standing There offer an authentic Cavern-in-the-60s experience, before – around the two-hour mark – a raucous Helter Skelter threatens to do for what’s left of the sweat-soaked singer’s now hoarse voice. Perhaps one or two more Beatles big guns wouldn’t have gone amiss, but the busker standing outside the venue helpfully obliges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aea2626ca1f9161a534bdec99864ee84d2933a56/0_236_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1e2ab69f85e4954b191a85be6a34a11","title":"vast haul of spice girls mementos goes on display","story":"Alan Smith-Allison’s huge trove ranges from costumes and cups to crackers and crispsA superfan’s jaw-dropping collection of Spice Girls memorabilia is to go on a UK tour of 12 cities. It includes costumes, dolls, flasks, lunch boxes, plates, cups, Christmas crackers, toys, biscuits and cushions.There are also cake toppers, jigsaws, radios, magazines, Easter eggs, Pepsi cans, drinking glasses, handbags, three Aprilia mopeds and dozens of packets of Walkers crisps.“I’ve always been a bit of a magpie,” said Alan Smith-Allison ahead of the opening of his Spice Girls exhibition in London on Saturday. “I always collected things when I was little.”The new show features thousands of examples of the multitudinous merchandise that accompanied the band, along with hundreds of costumes the Spice Girls wore for their performances, videos and movie.The double-decker bus that featured in the Spice World film will arrive and be parked outside the exhibition on Friday, borrowed from a marina on the Isle of Wight and lovingly restored thanks to a crowdfunding campaign.Visitors will also be able to watch footage from the Spice Girls’ Istanbul concert and, although not compulsory, the whole Spice World movie.Smith-Allison admits some people might see his obsession as being a little over the top. “I’ve met the two Mels and Geri,” he said. “I would love to meet Victoria and Emma, but at the same time I’m not going to go hang about their houses. I respect their privacy.”Smith-Allison was a teenager when Wannabe came out in 1996 and it changed his world. “In the 90s, being gay and 15-years-old, it was a bit uncomfortable at times. I grew up in Scotland, in a quiet countryside village and it wasn’t always easy.“I’m not saying ‘oh poor me’ because everybody was in the same boat in the 90s, but these girls came along and said ‘be who you want to be and it doesn’t matter’.”For girls it was about girl power. For Smith-Alison it was: “If you’re a bit different, a bit quirky then embrace it and go for it, as long as you work hard and try hard you can do whatever you want.”Smith-Alison was formerly a charity worker, but he realised after buying his first costume in 2007 was that what he really wanted was to build up perhaps the greatest Spice Girls collection in the world and make an exhibition out of it. It has not been cheap. His partner’s “hair would fall out” if he knew, he said. “It must be well over a hundred grand, probably a couple of hundred.”Smith-Allison said he had always seen the collection as an investment, and with 10,000 advance tickets already sold for the London show he may be proved right.The red corset dress with union jack detailing that Halliwell commissioned from Suzanne Neville for the 2012 London Olympics closing ceremony is part of the exhibition on loan from the designer.After London, the Spice Girls show will move to Manchester and 10 other cities over the next 18 months, Smith-Alison said. Dates are still to be announced.The band may gone their separate ways, but Smith-Allison said the Spice Girls were still as current today as ever. “Who doesn’t love a bit of fun and girl power and cheesy pop music?”• The Spice Girl Exhibition is at the Business Design Centre, Islington, from 28 July to 20 August, and at the Manchester Central Convention Complex from 24 August to 4 September This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

After Theresa May’s Chequers deal and the subsequent departures from the cabinet of Boris Johnson and David Davis, the Conservative party is ided and the Brexit debate has entered its final, critical phase. How did we end up here? And what could happen in the coming months?In the 1990s, as Conservative opposition to ever-growing closeness to what was now the EU festered, John Major faced repeated challenges from what he called the “bastards” – die-hard Eurosceptic MPs who opposed the Maastricht treaty and other integration moves.After the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown years, during which the main debate about Europe was whether or not the UK should join the euro, from 2010 David Cameron was tormented both by Tory Eurosceptics and a seemingly rampant Ukip, and so in 2013 he proposed an inout vote. Emboldened by the 2014 Scottish independence vote, he took the Tories into the 2015 election with an EU referendum as a manifesto pledge. There are two key dates in Theresa May’s mind: 18 October, which is the start of the two-day EU summit that is expected to approve a withdrawal agreement and 29 March 2019, Brexit day. But there are several other milestones along the way.In September the government is due to unveil its plans for a post-Brexit immigration policy, one of the most tortuous and controversial elements of the process. Then, at the end of the month, May faces what could be a hugely hostile Conservative party conference.If all this is achieved, the work begins on trade talks and the other measures to come into force at the start of 2021, when the transition period is due to end. This would be when any deal on a backstop solution to prevent a hard border in Ireland would – in the UK’s view – expire.Is the Chequers proposal dead?It’s certainly not very popular, possibly even among May’s cabinet, but it has one thing in its favour. No one else currently has an alternative plan that could conceivably pass through parliament and have a chance of being accepted by the EU while not breaking the Tory party apart. As with almost everything connected to Brexit though, all this could change.Will May face a leadership challenge, or could there be an election? As with her Brexit plan, the one thing keeping May in No 10 is the lack of a plausible alternative. The PM is, at best, grudgingly respected by her fellow Tory MPs for her dogged persistence, and many would like to see her go. Not enough seem committed to forcing an immediate leadership contest though, mindful that installing a committed Brexiter in her place could fracture the party, and that the two most talked-up contenders, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, are hugely isive in their own party, let alone the country. As such, May seems a fair bet to see Brexit through. As with the Chequers plan, however, everything could change almost overnight. An election is seen as less likely, with MPs painfully aware the public would not relish yet another call on their attention, and it could be seen as self-indulgent given the Brexit deadlines. Conservative MPs in particular will have also noted their party’s recent mini-slump in the polls.What are the various camps up to this summer?With parliament in recess until September, it would be nice to think the more single-minded MPs from both sides will focus on constituency duties, and on reintroducing themselves to their families and spending a quiet couple of weeks on a beach.In reality, the plotting is unlikely to take a summer break. May cannot realistically expect a leadership challenge without the Commons sitting, but her principal opponents will be gathering their forces before the Tory conference.Similarly, some among the majority of Labour members who wish Jeremy Corbyn would do more to oppose or mitigate Brexit will hope to raise a proper debate on the issue at their conference. This could even include dissent from the Momentum group that back Corbyn.Officially, just two. A deal based on May’s Chequers plan, with whatever alterations are imposed during negotiations, or a departure without a deal, whether moving to World Trade Organisation trade terms or some other hastily agreed arrangement.Some of May’s MPs advocate other options. Boris Johnson used his first speech since stepping down as foreign secretary to call for a plan based on May’s more hard Brexit-based Mansion House speech, while David Davis’s allies hanker after a Canada-style deal. Given the strict timetable, however, and lack of any details as to how these would work, it seems a big ask.What are the forecasts for these options?The only semi-official forecasts, made by government officials and seen by MPs but not published, suggest that whatever Brexit outcome emerges, the UK economy will take something of a hit.Brexiters have dismissed the figures as alarmist, and it is true that it is difficult to extrapolate what might happen given so many variables, but big business groups such as the CBI and Institute of Directors agree that a no-deal Brexit would be seen as the most damaging.Could there be a second referendum, and what would it ask?What was until fairly recently something of a fringe position, advocated largely by the Liberal Democrats and the remainer edge of the Labour party, has moved slightly more into the mainstream in recent weeks.The idea seems unlikely though, for now at least, given the government’s intractable opposition, the public’s scepticism and the, at best, ambivalence of the Labour leadership. There is also extremely limited time to make the necessary legal preparations.Could it all be delayed?Pressured UK negotiators would be advised not to rely on this. Some believe that if the October EU summit fails to reach a deal, an emergency EU gathering before the end of the year could achieve one, but that’s probably as far as the flexibility goes. The one overriding reason is article 50. When this was triggered by May’s government on 29 March 2017, it set in place a formal legal process heading in one direction: the UK’s exit precisely two years later.Officials in Brussels say that while the article 50 process could in theory be extended, there would be no appetite to do so if it were merely to delay an inevitably disorderly departure. The only way it could conceivably happen, they say, would be because of some fundamental shift in the UK position, for example a new prime minister or a general election.When will we know if it’s been worth it?Among the many moveable deadlines of Brexit, this is perhaps the most elusive of them all. For all the Brexiters’ pre-referendum talk of sunlit uplands and the easiest trade deals imaginable, even some diehard believers now seem to be arguing that the benefits will be more visible in the long term.How long term depends on who you ask. In a much-shared recent interview with Channel 4 News, the Brexit cheerleader Jacob Rees-Mogg was challenged on how the success or otherwise of departure could be gauged. He replied that it was “a question of timescale”. Pressed on this, he said: “The overwhelming opportunity for Brexit is over the next 50 years.”• This article was amended on 26 July 2018. Measures would be set to come into force at the start of 2021, not the end of that year as an earlier version said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e067f63b1c2e8d72bdb8e8ba76a7954e7980584/0_311_5068_3041/master/5068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a346e3d29dc4e019eec49977e54b8a3c","title":"michel barnier tears up theresa mays brexit customs proposals","story":"EU’s chief Brexit negotiator says UK ministers’ attempts to appeal to inidual leaders are ‘waste of time’Michel Barnier has warned that attempts to appeal to EU leaders over his head were a waste of time as he rejected Theresa May’s proposals on customs after Brexit, in effect killing off the Chequers plan.Against a backdrop of British cabinet ministers travelling across Europe to persuade governments of the benefits of the proposals, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator insisted there was no difference in opinion to exploit.“Anyone who wants to find a sliver of difference between my mandate and what the heads of government say they want are wasting their time, quite frankly,” he told reporters at a joint press conference with the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, in Brussels.The British negotiators have become increasingly frustrated with the EU’s attitude to the white paper thrashed out at the prime minister’s country retreat. They feel that it will take an intervention by leaders, most likely at a summit in Salzburg in September, to move the dial in favour of a deal. A number of cabinet ministers have been despatched around EU capitals to make their case for greater flexibility.The impasse in the negotiations were laid bare in the press conference in the European commission’s Berlaymont headquarters as a thunderstorm broke outside.While Raab insisted that with “political will” a deal on trade and on avoiding a border on the island of Ireland was achievable by a crunch summit in October, Barnier offered a damning verdict on a major element of the UK’s vision of the future.To avoid customs checks after Brexit, the government wants an unprecedented system where the UK would collect EU duties while having the freedom to set different tariffs on goods destined for the British market.The plan would allow the UK to make its own free trade deals around the world, while not losing the benefits of frictionless trade to and from the rest of Europe.But echoing the language of Theresa May on her goals for Brexit, Barnier responded: “Maintaining control of our money, law and borders also applies to the EU customs policy. The EU cannot and will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules, VAT and duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU governance structures.“Any customs arrangements or customs union – and I have always said that the EU is open to a customs union – must respect this principle.”Moments earlier, Barnier had struck a warmer note by saying he was “particularly pleased” with the progress of talks on foreign policy and security. But he added: “On our future economic relationship, it comes as no surprise that finding common ground between the EU27 and the UK is more difficult.” Raab, in his second appearance in Brussels since he replaced David Davis in the cabinet, claimed in response that the EU needed to display some of the creativity it had applied in the past.He said: “We have designed our proposals both to respect the result of the referendum, and the core principles of the EU. We have considered the innovative approaches the EU has taken in the past with other third countries – when the political will has been there.”Barnier offered the UK some cause for hope with regard to its temporary customs proposals, which are designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland in the period before the final arrangements are ready. The technology needed for the UK’s customs plan in the white paper, in the unlikely event of a U-turn by Barnier, is not expected to be ready until 2022 at the earliest.The EU is seeking what Barnier likes to call “an-all weather insurance policy”, known as the backstop, that would kick into place should the two sides be unable to agree a new trading relationship.The commission’s negotiator conceded that a UK-wide customs plan, avoiding a border in the Irish sea, was the goal, rather than one that simply kept Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs territory.“We have no objection in principle to this,” Barnier said. “But we have doubts that this can be done without putting at risk the integrity of our customs union, our common commercial policy, our regulatory policy and our fiscal revenue.”He said Raab had promised to answer those concerns when they meet again in mid-August.The two men clashed on whether the Brexit orce treaty would be reopened over the bill: the UK’s debts accrued over 45 years of membership that British officials estimate to be £39bn. Raab said there needed to be “conditionality” tying the Brexit orce bill to the deal on future relations.Barnier countered: “It is quite clear that what has been agreed in December and agreed in March has been agreed for good,” referring to the deals May signed with EU leaders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1d5068167cfd9875b3ffa0c7e24945d07b4985e/0_195_5161_3096/master/5161.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e7a935f371a701b90f9633a544ae0a6","title":"brexit not too late for uk to change its mind and stay in eu on same terms says french minister politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenHere is the text of Michel Barnier’s opening statement. And here is the text of Dominic Raab’s.And here are the main points.Maintaining control of our money, law, and borders also applies to the EU’s customs policy.The EU cannot - and the EU will not - delegate the application of its customs policy and rules, VAT and excise duty collections to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU’s governance structures.This goes significantly further than what Barnier said at a press conference at the end of last week when he raised concerns on this issue, but did not explicitly reject what the UK was offering. On Friday last week he said:This complex customs system also poses a more fundamental question: How can the Union delegate the application of its customs rules to a non-member of the EU, who would not be subject to governance structures? Would that be acceptable or, simply, legally possible?We had a good and constructive conversation today about how we make sure in practice that there is that link between those two key areas, the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on the future framework.But Barnier gave a different emphasis when he replied to the question about this. He said:It is quite right that there is agreement on nothing until we have agreement on everything. But what is perfectly clear to the 27 EU member states and the European Parliament is that what has been agreed in December and March has been agreed for good.This week confirmed that the UK proposals on security mark a real step forward. The UK has provided new guarantees for the protection of fundamental rights and the uniform application of law and the white paper commits the UK to membership of the European convention on human rights. It recognises the European court of justice as the only arbiter of EU law. These are important safeguards. They enlarge the possibilities of what we can do together on internal security, in particular on data exchange. Based on the protection of personal data, and based on reciprocity, the EU and the UK can explore the modalities for close cooperation on the following points: the exchange of DNA, fingerprints, and vehicle registration information (so called “Prüm”) the exchange of passenger name records to better track and identify iniduals involved in terrorism and crime swift and effective extradition, based on the procedural rights for suspects.There are other points on which we have a problem because they contradict, they clash with, the European Council guidelines. They contradict my clear negotiating guidelines. Inisibility of the four freedoms, the integrity of the single market, these are key points. This is our main asset. We are not going to negotiate on that. The United Kingdom has know that from the outset.That’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.Here is the key quote from Michel Barnier on the customs aspect of the Chequers Brexit plan - the “facilitated customs arrangement”, as the UK government calls it, that would involve the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU.Here is some reaction to the press conference from journalists and commentators.From the BBC’s Andrew NeilFrom the Daily Mail’s Jason GrovesFrom the Spectator’s James ForsythThis is what the European commission is tweeting about the Barnier statement from its Twitter feed.And this is from Barnier’s press officer.Q: Can the rest of the Conservative party accept the Chequers plan? And why not put this again to the British people for a second referendum?Raab says a second referendum is not acceptable. All parties said they would accept the referendum result.He says the UK plan would respect the autonomy of both sides, but maintain a close relationship.I will post reaction and a summary soon.Q: Would it be helpful for you to have EU heads of government intervening? Is there a point where they need to negotiate?Barnier says Raab needs his leader to push ahead. But he says he also works for leaders. He says he constantly reports back to EU member states. He works on their behalf. Anyone who wants to find a “sliver of difference” between what he is saying and what his mandate says is “wasting their time”.Q: The Chequers plan led to two cabinet minsters resigning. Your mandate says, if the UK’s government evolves, you will reconsider your offer. Do you see the Chequers plan as an evolution of the UK’s position?Barnier says he will not comment on the domestic debate in the UK. He says he negotiates with Theresa May, with Dominic Raab, and their teams. They are extremely competent and professional.He says he has been asking the UK to say what it wants. He welcomes the discussion in Chequers and the white paper. He has studied it carefully. He says he has set out some “positive points” in it. It can be “useful”, he says.He says the UK and the EU both want a free trade deal.And there are lots of points where they can find common ground.But there are other points where the EU has “a problem”, because the UK’s plans contradict his negotiating mandate. The EU is not going to compromise on the inisibility of the four freedoms, he says. It has always said that.The EU intends to defend the single market in all its aspects.Q: From what Barnier is saying, the Chequers plan has failed. Where does that leave you?Barnier says Brexit created the Irish border problem. It puts the Good Friday agreement at risk, he says.There has to be a backstop. Whether it is the EU’s backstop or the UK’s, we can discuss that. But he says he wants to “de-dramatise” this issue.They need to go through the list of border controls, one by one, and see what can be done about them.Q: Must the payment of the UK’s “Brexit bill” be conditional on a future trade deal?Raab says the UK has always been clear that there is no deal until the whole deal is finalised. He says he had a good, constructive conversation with Barnier today on how to link those two issues.Barnier says Raab is right to say nothing is agreed until everything has been agreed. But the EU’s view is that what was agreed in December and March is agreed for good.We must avoid any misunderstanding, he says.He says the UK has decided to leave the EU, with its single market and four freedoms. He says there might be a customs arrangement, a customs union or something else. He says the EU’s approach is not ideological.The EU has created an ecosystem of common laws, he says. The UK is leaving the single, legal jurisdiction.He says there is no way in which the EU can allow the single market to be undermined.In the medium to long term it would not be in the UK’s interests for the single market to be destabilised.Here is some comment on the press conference so far.From the ’s Steven SwinfordFrom the Sun’s Nick GutteridgeFrom the ’s Gordon RaynerRaab summarises what is proposed in the Chequers plan.He says the white paper has brought a “new dynamic” to talks about the future trade relationship.Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, is speaking now.He says a lot has been achieved to date, especially on the rights of citizens.He says they are stepping up efforts on how to preserve the Belfast agreement.Now they have three tasks.First, they must complete the withdrawal agreement. He says they have moved “closer” to agreement on the remaining areas, including governance and administrative procedures.Second, they must find a solution to the Irish issue. He says the UK government has a backstop plan. They have been discussing this. More work needs to be done, but he says he is “confident” he can work this up into a workable solution. He says it would have to be time-limited.Third, they need to reach an agreement on the future relationship. He says they would have to agree a timescale for firming this up after Brexit.Barnier says he has been focusing on withdrawal issues.Barnier says this week talks focused on the UK element of the backstop.The EU has no objection to this in principle, he says.But he says the EU “doubts” it can be done without putting at risk its commercial policy and its tariff system.He says the UK team has agreed to consider these objections. They will meet again in mid-August.Barnier is now talking about the backstop.Continued uncertainty would be unacceptable, he says.

On Wednesday’s brutal stage in the Pyrenees he had come in nearly 30 minutes behind Nairo Quintana and was immediately hit by insinuations on Twitter by Greipel that he held on to cars up the final climb to make the time cut.“Those comments made me more aggressive,” explained Démare, who blasted clear of his compatriot Christophe Laporte and Alexander Kristoff to win stage 18 from Trie-Sur-Baïse to Pau. “I was hurt by his comments. But the best answer I could give to Greipel was to win.”Démare was so far back on Wednesday that he was still going up the Col du Portet just as Chris Froome was coming down to the Team Sky bus – and the pair passed each other just before Froome was brought down by a policeman. However, he had recovered sufficiently to take the stage – and Laporte’s second place ensured that it was the first time that French riders had finished first and second in a sprint stage since 1978.“I sometimes regret that my performances are put in doubt,” added Démare, who was also accused of holding on to motorbikes in the 2016 Milan-San Remo race. “It is true that I am not the best rider in the mountain but I have worked hard to improve.“And there is always criticism and jealousy. There were a lot of referees in Milan-San Remo and if I had done anything wrong I would have been punished. On the stage yesterday there were a lot of judges too. I have nothing to say to the critics, they can say what they want.”Meanwhile Thomas was delighted at moving a step closing to winning his first yellow jersey.“It definitely wasn’t an easy stage,” he said. “We were on the pedals all day and it was hot which made it tough. It was a really fast finale too which was a bit stressful, so I’m happy to make it through.”The Welshman is only two days from Paris but he is refusing to think about the yellow jersey given that Friday’s final stage in the mountains and Saturday’s inidual time trial still to come. “I try to just think about it day by day. But obviously there’s one more big mountain day,” he said. “It’s the last road stage and we’re expecting a lot of attacks.”1\u0026nbspA\u0026nbspDemare (Fr) FDJ 3hr 46min 50sec 2\u0026nbspC\u0026nbspLaporte (Fr) Cofidis 3\u0026nbspA\u0026nbspKristoff (Nor) Team Emirates 4\u0026nbspE\u0026nbspBoasson Hagen (Nor) Dimension Data 5\u0026nbspS\u0026nbspColbrelli (It) Bahrain-Merida 6\u0026nbspM\u0026nbspRicheze (Arg) Quick‑Step 7\u0026nbspJ\u0026nbspDegenkolb (Ger) Trek‑Segafredo 8\u0026nbspP\u0026nbspSagan (Svk) Bora-Hansgrohe 9\u0026nbspT\u0026nbspPhinney (US) Cannondale 10\u0026nbspT\u0026nbspDupont (Bel) Wanty-Groupe Gobert all st.King of the Mountains: 1\u0026nbspJ\u0026nbspAlaphilippe (Fr) Quick-Step 140pts 2\u0026nbspW\u0026nbspBarguil (Fr) Fortuneo-Samsic 73 3\u0026nbspG\u0026nbspThomas (GB) Team Sky 54 4\u0026nbspN\u0026nbspQuintana (Col) Movistar 40 5\u0026nbspT\u0026nbspDumoulin (Neth) Sunweb 39."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cadc5311d5f5177d28fdf8935926a3f46cdc0e56/0_51_4294_2577/master/4294.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53e05153def35160fbc726399a1e3853","title":"tour de france 2018 stage 18 live","story":"The Groupama-FDJ rider shook off overnight insinuations of cheating (since retracted) to win the bunch sprintArnaud Demare shook off overnight insinuations of cheating (since retracted) from fellow rider Andre Greipel to win the stage for Groupama-FDJ.An anecdote from Sam Lister: “Earlier this year, while on a ride through South Wales, I had the good fortune to bump into Geraint Thomas at a set of traffic lights,” he says. “He was head to toe in his Team Sky kit and had those hideous sunnies on. My first reaction was to swear loudly in his face, which isn’t how you should greet a personal hero.”No, it isn’t. “Anyway, we got over that and then proceeded to ride together for the next 30 mins,” Sam continues. “|He actively encouraged it I was trying to play it cool. We spoke mainly about Neil Warnock, but also how much he hates the diet he has to stick to. He was just a thoroughly lovely bloke. But a note of caution: I have a terrible record of people breaking bones on bikes shortly after riding with me. Needless to say, this Tour isn’t over yet.” Geraint Thomas leads from Tom Dumoulin and Chris Froome with just one mountain stage (tomorrow), one time-trial (Saturday) and one procession into Paris (Sunday) to go. Judging by the comments of other riders in the peloton, Thomas will be a very popular winner, assuming he holds on. He’s one of those rare people nobody seems to have a bad word to say about. Nobody, that is, except me - he once stood me up for an interview on the Copcabana in Rio. Those were the days!!! Geraint Thomas retains the yellow jersey: Ignoring all the fireworks exploding up at the front, the main GC riders finished safely down the field, so it’s as you were as far as that’s concerned. Demare wins: Arnaud Demare wins the stage by half-a-bike-length from Christophe Laporte, who gestured angrily at the victor as they crossed the line. I’m not sure what his beef is, as it looked a fair contest. Alexander Kristoff was third in a fascinating sprint. The winning time: 3hr 46min 50sec. The Groupama-FDJ rider gets a perfect lead-out to win stage 18. 200m to go: Arnaud Demare goes for it! 2km to go: Sagan surfs from wheel to wheel, trying to decide which is the best one to latch on to. Alexander Kristoff is also near the front, looking for his lead-out man. 4km to go: Sagan drops back a bit, with three of his own teammates still leading the dash through Pau. Such are his improvisational skills, Sagan won’t need to rely on them for a lead-out, but their presence at the front to control the pace is a help. 4.5km to go: The road is wide and the riders of Bora Hansgrohe and Groupama-FDJ are at the front of the bunch, occupying one half of it. 6km to go: Bora Hansgrohe’s train lines up at the front of the bunch, their riders shovelling coal into the furnace as the stage approaches its knockings. Peter Sagan is third or fourth from the front and has a long look over his right shoulder. 9km to go: As if by magic and on cue, Bora Hansgrohe’s riders move to the front of the bunch on the wide road into Pau. They’\\re going at a ferocious lick and the peloton is really strung out. 14 km to go: Groupama-FDJ continue to drag the bunch along, while Cofidis move towards the front to get Christopher Laporte into position. UAE Team Emirates rider Alexander Kristoff will be another fancying his chances today, while Peter Sagan can’t be ruled out either despite his crash yesterday. His Bora Hansgrohe team-mates have done no work today, while the rider played down his chances before the start of the stage. A cynic might suggest that’s a massive bluff on their part. 16km to go: The peloton reforms, but is strung out like the washing on a clothes line. In their livery of red, white and blue, the riders of Groupama-FDJ put the hammer down at the front of the bunch as they begin the process of setting things up for their sprinter, Arnaud Demare. 16km to go: There’s a small split in the peloton, with a group of 12 riders putting a few seconds between them and the rest of the pack. 18km to go: The field tackle the second and final speed-bump of the day, the Cat 4 Cote d’Anos. It marks the end of the breakaway, but hats off to Luke Durbridge (Mitchelton-Scott), Thomas Boudat (Direct Energie), Matt Hayman (Mitchelton-Scott) , Niki Terpstra (Quick-Step) and Guillaume Van Keirsbulck (Wonty-Groupe Gobert) for a courageous day’s work. 20km to go: As we approach the business end of the race, the riders are getting their game faces on, as are the  readers and their commentator. The final word on Team Sky today goes to Colum, who has this to say ...“Domination of any sport by one team does breed contempt, right enough,” he says. “Somemany people came to dislike Barcelona’s football because it won so consistently, even if it was wonderful to watch. “The Sky cycling team become like automatons simply because they are so good. Hence we want to denigrate them. Add to that the significantly unlikeable Brailsford and his holier-than-thou attitude.“But they are relatively new to cycling, so how come they have ‘superior training methods’? And money alone does not make a good team as football has shown us, so maybe the secret ingredient is actually Brailsford himself. So we are stuck between admiring and hating them because of their abilities. A bit like Mourinho and Man Utd?”I think there’s more than an enough in that very considered mail to enrage people on both sides of the Sky fence! 27km to go: The gap is under a minute for the first time in a while. Just 46 seconds worth of road separate the five-man breakaway from the peloton. 34km to go: In the breakaway, duties are being shared on a fairly equal basis. Niki Terpstra seems to be doing more than his fair share on the front, but is currently having a breather as fifth man. The gap is down to 1min 06sec. 35km to go: The peloton is travelling at an average speed of 43.71 kilometres per hour, but Adam Hirst wishes they’d speed things up a bit. “Today is the reason that TV coverage used to be limited to the last couple of hours,” he says. “Will it ever end?”An email from Daryl: “Perhaps someone can explain why other teams can’t just decide themselves to increase the speed of the peloton?” he writes. “Surely the only thing that other teams can’t do is slow the peloton down, but they are perfectly capable of increasing it? Is this actually a genuine problem of Sky controlling the pace all the time, or more of a case that the other teams are happy to let Sky do the majority of the hard graft at the front?” As far as I know, the problem is that the peloton often goes so fast at Sky’s behest, that other teams struggle just to keep up and ramping up the speed is out of the question. What wit5h their big budgets and apparently superior training methods, Sky have way more strength in depth than other teams and can therefore take a stranglehold on Grand Tours which most cycling fans consider very boring. They are, of course, under no obligation to entertain. 42km to go: The gap is 1min 13sec as the peloton keep tabs on the five-man breakaway. The camera cuts to Direct Energie rider Thomas Boudet taking a “sticky bottle” from his team car. It only takes five seconds or so for it to change hands, which means there isn’t that much glue on it. Maybe they’re running out at this late stage of the Tour. 48km to go: Five-man breakaway ... 1min 20sec ... peloton. With so little going on out on the road, the French TV producer is letting his imagination run wild, now treating viewers to a series of slow, moody close-ups of Luke Durbridge looking pensive in the five-man escape party. 56km to go: Flanked by cornfields, the riders roll along at a leisurely pace with the gap between the five-man breakaway and the peloton at 1min 10sec.There is so little going on that Eurosport have just cut to a lengthy feature about the various hairstyles sported by some riders in the peloton. That scratching sound you can hear is that of a barrel being scraped with just three days of the Tour remaining. I’m going to pull in to the side of the road for a quick comfort break, but will be back in five minutes. Seeing as we were talking about bidons, learn how to drink from one while I’m away ...59km to go: AG2R rider Pierre Latour, wearing the white jersey for best young rider, drops out of the peloton and goes back to his team car to pick up some water-bottles and energy gels. He doesn’t over-burden himself – I’m told the record number of full bidons carried by one rider to distribute among his team-mates is 16. Travelling back to and through the peloton to give them out to various team-mates must be seriously energy-sapping. Nancy Karrer has a question: “Sorry but what does ‘skybot’ mean?” she asks. “It keeps coming up. What does it mean?” I believe, Nancy, that it’s a derogatory reference to the apparently tireless line of Sky riders that can invariably be found controlling the pace at the front of the peloton. Fans of Team Sky, an alarming number of whom can be precious, humourless and over-sensitive bunch, really don’t like it. Hence it’s almost constant use across myriad media platforms by people who enjoy winding them up.Michael Evans writes: “I had previously read that race organizers designate feed zones and those typically include ‘green’ areas before and after the feed zone, so racers have a specific area to toss empty bottlestrash prior to and following the feed,” he writes, making a hell of a lot of sense. “The goal is to minimize the areas where discarded items and associated chaos could cause a crash and also to aid in clean-up of said discarded items that are not sought after by fans (wrappers, etc.).”63km to go: Luke Durbridge (Mitchelton-Scott), Thomas Boudat (Direct Energie), Matt Hayman (Mitchelton-Scott) , Niki Terpstra (Quick-Step) and Guillaume Van Keirsbulck (Wonty-Groupe Gobert) are in the breakaway and have been almost since the gun. The gap between them and the peloton is at 1min 21sec. Cofidis rider Anthony Perez is towing the bunch along as not very much continues to happen at great length. More on depression in the peloton: “Further to Stefan Volkmann’s message regarding mental health in the peloton, it’s worth checking out Molly Weaver’s upfront and brutally honest account of her battle with depression,” writes Alan Mackie. “Might be of interest to folks if they haven’t seen it.” Good shout, Alan - I remember reading this when it was published originally. Marcus has a question: “You’ve mentioned several times Team Sky taking food and drink outside of the feedzone,” he says. “If this is allowed, then what purpose do the actual feed zones serve? Are they just recommendations so fans can potentially get some souvenirs?”Yep, Marcus has a question and it’s a very good one that I can’t answer. Designated feedzones are famously chaotic, so it would make sense for them to be in different places. Anyone know why that isn’t the case? Here’s some info on feedzones, from the people at the Global Cycling Network. 76km to go: It’s more or less as you were, with the gap between the five-man breakaway and the peloton at around 1min 30sec. Nairo Quintana has changed his shirt. The riders are approaching Duhort-Bachen, where an artistic helicopter cameraman, who is possibly auditioning for a job on the next David Attenborough nature extravaganza is treating TV viewers to footage of a very nice chateau followed by some sweeping panoramic vistas from overhead. Here we go: In this report, which requires me to let readers know what is going on in the race, however uneventful it may be on a day like today, I recently reported that the riders of Team Sky had taken on food and drink outside of the feed zone, as they are entitled to do.This, from Charles: “Should you not be providing unbiased commentary on the current stage?” he asks. “The continual ‘skybot’ mantra is both boring and getting rather tiresome and ironically is alienating the people viewing said commentary. Get a grip.”While I applaud Charles for (a) having as firm a grasp of irony as Alanis Morisette and (b) for his apparent success in being appointed spokesman for all our readers at some meeting to which I wasn’t invited, I’m struggling to figure out how reporting the controversial news that ‘some men have been given food before any other men were given food’ is in any way biased.News, as we get it from Charles, on whether reporting that Nairo Quintana has a sore arm is against the spirit of kilometre-by-kilometre cycling commentary. More on Peter Kennaugh and his mojo: “I read an interesting piece on him in Cycling Weekly before the Dauphine carrying quotes which suggested that his lack of early season racing this year was down to mental health issues preventing him from training,” writes Stefan Volkmann. “Fair play to him for being upfront with his problems if so - haven’t seen any other pro being as honest in a sport which places huge demands on the athletes mentally as well as physically.” 90km to go: Stuyven and Vanmarcke have been reeled back in by the peloton, leaving the original five out in front with an advantage of two minutes. 97km to go: Trek-Segafredo’s Michael Gogl aborts his attempt to catch the five-man breakaway and leaves Stuyven and Vanmarcke to it. Way back in the field, Nairo Quintana is being paced back to the bunch with what looks like a very nasty injury to his left elbow. 100km to go: Michael Gogl (Trek-Segafredo), Jasper Stuyven (Trek-Segafredo) and Sep Vanmarcke (EF Education First–Drapac pb Cannondale) are the trio who jumped off the front of the bunch, upsetting my plans to get away from this keyboard for five minutes. The gap between the five-man breakaway and the yellow jersey group is 52 seconds and they’re in no-man’s land somewhere in between.

Whether you fancy paddleboarding around the coast or zipwiring across the treetops, here’s how to unlock a healthier, happier you this spring and summerFrom reducing blood pressure to alleviating symptoms of depression, countless studies have proved that being outdoors and in contact with nature is beneficial for both physical and mental health. In these milder months, there’s no excuse not to be outside as much as possible. Here are nine ideas for inspiration.Ride a waveThe north Cornwall coast, with its big Atlantic seas, is Britain’s premier surf destination, with Fistral beach at Newquay probably the country’s best-known surf beach. But there are great places to learn to surf all around the UK. If you’re after a board experience with a less steep learning curve, stand-up paddleboarding offers the chance to take to the water in an easy-to-learn fashion. As well as the exhilaration of surfing the waves, paddleboarding can be a means of exploring the wonders of Britain’s tranquil inland waterways.Get started: Surfing England (surfingengland.org) has information on surf clubs and learning to surf. The British Stand Up Paddle Association website (bsupa.org.uk) has information on where to learn.See colours in bloomSpring and summer are the best times to explore England’s most glorious gardens. Among the Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) stunners is its flagship garden, Wisley in Surrey. Home to one of the world’s largest plant collections, it’s a riot of flowering bulbs and blossoms in spring, with fragrant roses and colourful mixed borders in summer. The RHS also runs summer flower shows around the country, including the world-famous Chelsea flower show. The National Trust is  to more than 200 gardens and landscaped parks, many attached to its historic houses, with Studley Royal water gardens at Fountains Abbey, also a world heritage site, among the best known.Freewheel through forest trailsZip along peaceful country lanes between summer hedgerows, pedal past glowering mountains above Scotland’s Glencoe pass as part of a tour or expedition, race with other cyclists, or even head off-road along forest trails on a mountain bike. Cycling can provide high-adrenaline sport or light, relaxing exercise, but whichever way you ride, getting on a bike gives you an up-close view of the countryside that you’d never get from a car.Get started: Cycling UK (cyclinguk.org) can help you get on the road, with advice on everything from buying a bike to cycling groups and routes.Escape to the countryCity dwellers craving a rural fix should seek out one of the many regional annual outdoor shows, a celebration of farming and rural life, with sheep and cattle competitions, horse and dog shows, sheep-shearing contests and farm machinery displays. These days, though, the events are also packed with family-friendly entertainments, ranging from air displays and carriage-driving races to skateboarding and marching bands. Local producers showcase their food and drink, and makers display arts and crafts.Get started:UK County Shows (ukcountyshows) has countrywide information and links to inidual shows.Swim in scenic surroundingsWhat could be a more perfect summer idyll than plunging into a cool lake or river on a hot, sunny day? Wild swimming – taking a dip in rivers, lakes, streams and waterfalls – has a growing number of fans. Popular spots to swim include Ullswater in the Lake District and lochs throughout Scotland, while rivers in the Brecon Beacons are home to stunning waterfall plunge pools. In the south of England, Pangbourne on the river Thames is one of many popular locations, and there are even urban swims to be had in London’s Serpentine and Highgate ponds.Get started: There’s information on locations throughout the UK and all-important safety tips tips at wildswimming.Soar into the treetopsThere’s a special kind of thrill to hurtling through the treetops suspended on a wire. Locations range from urban parks (such as Heaton Park in Manchester and Battersea Park in London) to mountains and forests. Zip World, with locations in Wales, offers a variety of adventures through forest, over a quarry and even – this one’s for the fitter and more adventurous – underground in caverns. Go Ape has locations throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and a collection of mainly forest-based attractions.Kayak along the waterwaysBritain has thousands of miles of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and canals canoeing (single-ended paddle), or kayaking (double-ended paddle), is a great way to explore them. Assuming you don’t have your own canoe, you’ll need to join a club or go to an activity centre, where staff will generally help new paddlers with an induction session. Sea kayaking is a lot of fun, too, and more experienced paddlers may enjoy canoe polo (just as it sounds) or white-water canoeing. Get started: British Canoeing (britishcanoeing.org.uk) has information on canoe clubs and activity centres around the country, and on canoe hire.Walk this wayWhether it’s a Sunday stroll or a serious hike, there’s no simpler – or cheaper – way to explore Britain’s great outdoors than on foot. The British countryside is laced with public footpaths all you need to get going is a pair of walking boots or sturdy trainers (plus a map and weatherproof gear if you’re going far). Among myriad footpaths, 16 national trails pass through some of the country’s most iconic landscapes. They include the South West Coast Path, with 630 miles of trails snaking around the Dorset, Devon, Cornwall and Somerset coasts, and northern England’s hilly Pennine Way.Get started: National Trails (nationaltrail). In addition, Ramblers (ramblers.org.uk) has suggestions for hiking routes on its website.Combine your love of music with the outdoorsPack your tent and wellington boots and head for one of the country’s iconic music festivals this summer. These days the biggest international names (from Beyoncé to Ed Sheeran) vie to play them: there’s no other way to see so many top artists in a single location. Glastonbury is taking a break in 2018, but there are many others picking up the slack, from Bestival to Latitude, the Isle of Wight festival, V and many more.

A good nosy at their previously unseen personal possessions and artefacts, that’s what. This summer, that’s exactly what London’s V\u0026ampA museum delivers in the much-anticipated Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up. The majority of this collection of jewellery, letters, photographs and items from her wardrobe (including hand-painted corsets) was only recently discovered, having been shut away for 50 years since her death. Consider this essential for demystifying the Mexican artist and sartorial icon, and it’s a lot cheaper than going all the way to Mexico. Granted, the exhibition is indoors, but you can combine your visit with a stop-off at the V\u0026ampA’s garden cafe, a hidden oasis in the centre of the museum, where you can sit at one of the courtyard tables or picnic on the lawn.vam.ac.uk from 16 JuneArrange a bouquet of flowersYou don’t have to be embarking on a second career as a florist to appreciate a beautifully arranged bunch of flowers, although a workshop at The Narcissus Flower School in Edinburgh could well send you in that direction. From learning to hand-tie a spring wedding bouquet to perfecting a festival-ready floral crown, this is the place to go this summer for cutting-edge botanical design. The highlight in the programme has to be The Foragers Garden Party workshop, which caters to all al fresco needs, from rustic barbecues to afternoon tea. Bring it on.narcissusflowers 21 June (and various dates)Learn a new craftStep away from the sandy beaches and seafood and head straight to The Studio at Burlingham Hall in Norfolk to get your hands – rather than your toes – dirty this summer. Artist Victoria Hall runs a two-day workshop for beginners in the art of paper marbling at this picturesque country estate. You’ll learn about the history, get familiar with watercolours, and tackle various paper patterns (including curl and comb designs). In fact, you’ll have a range of eclectic designs under your belt by the end. And if you don’t leave feeling like a born-again artist, you’ll certainly have the materials to make some pretty alternative Christmas cards.burlinghamhall 16-17 AugustGo down to the woodsHead to the Latitude festival for late-night poetry, light installations, and the biggest comedy, theatre, and arts line up in its 12-year history. Held in Suffolk’s picturesque Henham Park, Latitude is renowned for its eclectic arts programme, with a bit of yoga and lake swimming thrown in for good measure. This year it’s all about Bridget Christie and Tim Key in the comedy selection, while the Killers and Alt-J are definitely headliners to be reckoned with. But it’s the addition of enigmatic music and fashion icon Solange to the bill – her first time heading up a UK festival – that’ll be a real feast of the senses.latitudefestival 12-15 JulyFill up at a foodie festivalIs your idea of heaven on a hot day hitting up a beer garden?

There are four locations – Higginson Park in Marlow, Royal Victoria Park in Bath, Dunorlan Park in Tunbridge Wells and Knutsford, Cheshire – to choose from. Dishes from Kerridge’s own Michelin-starred Marlow pubs The Hand and Flowers and The Coach will pop up at the four festivals, alongside others from throughout Britain, and there’ll be chef demonstrations and a whole foodie village to shop in. Let’s not forget the soundtrack – brought to you live by the likes of Tom Odell and Razorlight.www.pubintheparkuk various dates between 17 May and 9 SeptemberSee a film under the starsIf you see one film this summer, just make sure it is outdoors. When it’s warm outside (and even when it’s not) there is no shortage of quirky film events, but Picnic Cinema – run by the arts organisation and charity Eden Arts, in Penrith, Cumbria – pulls out all the stops. You can dress up, bring your own picnic (the clue is in the title), and even sleep over. With music, dancing and surprise entertainment, amid spectacular scenic views, you may even forget you’re there to watch a film. Last year, revellers got suitably attired for Pulp Fiction, Withnail and I and The Wicker Man so we can’t wait to see what this year has in store. Just don’t forget your torch.picniccinema various datesJoin the circusIf you’ve ever dreamed of running away with the circus, now’s your chance.

Here, she explains how her palate has developed, and the importance of smell in getting the most out of a tastingIt was while I was working as a model in my 20s that I discovered a real love of wine, and realised how important the nose is in my ability to taste. But I certainly wouldn’t have guessed that wine would become my passion and career. Before that, if I’m honest, wine was not a big part of my life at all. Growing up, my parents would buy the odd cheap bottle if someone was coming for dinner but it’s not like they collected it or took us to vineyards in the summer holidays.When I got older, I much preferred wine to beer or spirits, but I was totally unsophisticated and used to drink fortified wine flavoured with herbs, which I don’t remember ever sniffing. I thought I was drinking a cocktail. Now I know it was just a vermouth, which is trendy these days, but at the time it was just sweet and easy to drink. A bit later, I was in a bar with actual grownups and didn’t know what to drink. I asked for a martini, so they got me a real one and I was like: “Woah, that is so strong – that’s not what I remember.”Going to France changed all that. I was about 22 and my career was going well and I was lucky to be able to travel and experience lots of different food and cultures. I remember working in France and being amazed that on shoots they would all stop for lunch. In London, nobody stopped for lunch and you’d be constantly starving and usually freezing cold.But on this one job, for a big store in Paris one November, there was a big budget and I thought: “OK, this is going to be a good lunch.” But then we were working through it and I was wondering what was going on. Then, at about three o’clock, everything stopped. It turned out it was Beaujolais Nouveau Day, when people celebrate the harvest of the new wine. I didn’t know what it was but we sat there for hours eating and drinking and it really felt like I’d found my kindred spirits.By my late 20s I was getting a bit bored of modelling and got into restaurants. I cooked and then got into wine, and then I ended up crafting a freelance career as a consultant sommelier. I also write, and run Wine Car Boot, an occasional independent market for wine tasting and buying. During this stage of my life, smell became so important. When you know nothing about wine, you go to the supermarket and it’s all about the same price and they all say on the labels that they’re really delicious. But it was when I began to engage in taste and smell that I realised I could make better choices.The more you smell, the more you can sense things and the more enjoyment you get out of wine. That allows you to learn more, which spurs you on to wanting to taste more and different things. Even a small amount of engagement in your senses – especially smell – enhances your enjoyment of life generally, and you get more out of everything you do.The whole thing about how to taste wine is really how to smell it. Sure, wine does also affect your mouth – the sweetness on your tongue, the acidity and structure on your gums, and how mouthwatering it is – and you could have the best wine in the world and just swallow it down and still enjoy it. But it’s about maximising that pleasure, like savouring an amazing sandwich rather than just wolfing it down. And if you hold your nose while tasting wine you don’t taste much.When I smell a wine now I’m looking for a hint of what’s there – to start the tasting process. Does it smell fresh or older? What kind of fruits am I getting? Does it smell particularly alcoholic or is it very delicate? What is the grape variety? Non-aromatic wines can be very minerally and refreshing, and more able to take on other flavours. Then the aromatic grapes have a strong perfume, like a good riesling. Sometimes it can be like smelling a perfume rather than grapes.I love the perfumes of grapes like pinot noir and burgundy that are highly fragrant, often with some oak in them. You can get floral and spicy or even leathery notes. Instead of being a single smell there’s a whole load going on. Every time I smell a wine like that I can detect something new.It’s got to the stage now where I can’t really remember what it was like to not smell wine, and when I go back and have the wines I drank 10 or 15 years ago they seem awful. Your palate changes both with experience and age and you become more or less sensitive to certain things. I certainly think I have a bigger perspective on smells now. It isn’t like wine experts go around having this constantly fragrant experience of everything and that we’re hypersensitive. But it does become habitual. Sometimes I find myself almost smelling a glass of water and I’m like: Why am I doing this?Wine has also made me more aware of smells in cooking. I swing between rosemary and sage as my favourite herbs. When I worked in restaurants, I did the wine list for a chef called Stevie Parle. He makes these amazing kind of fried sage leaves, done almost in a tempura batter that you can nearly see through. Crispy-sage crisps almost, with this fragrant, herbal and slightly sweet touch to them. They’re absolutely delicious. I could think of a few wines to pair with them, but I’d have them as a little nibble with a glass of good, cold champagne - and I would smell them and savour every moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40d5117a268c0ec5178f5d9ed1cc76815fbdcbdc/0_380_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d5584ecbe541e1982f62f47e1709ace","title":"parklife britains green spaces in urban places","story":"Spending time outdoors in nature has a hugely positive effect on our wellbeing, but you don’t have to live in a rural area to experience the benefits. Kevin Rushby shares some of his favourite city parks, heaths, wetlands and gardens The only British city to ever win the European Green Capital award (for 2015), Bristol is an urban park-lover’s paradise. Close to the centre is Castle Park, a garden with ruins that is linked across the river by the elegant Castle footbridge. There’s a good five-mile walk to be had along the river, linking gardens and the docks, including Brandon Hill Park. Climb the 30-metre-tall (105ft) Cabot Tower for a fine city view. Scattered all around the city are some great parks worthy of cycle adventures. To the south there is Victoria Park, presided over by the colourful terraced houses of St Luke’s Crescent. Nearby, a real gem is Arnos Vale Victorian cemetery, 18 hectares (45 acres) of greenery where, with luck, you can spot woodpeckers, deer and even slow worms basking on tombstones.Arriving at Glasgow Central, you might be forgiven for wondering where all the green spaces might be, given the extent to which the city’s formidable architecture dominates. Dotted around, however, are some magnificent spots: a top place to go is Kelvingrove, a park with everything for a day out – cafes (try An Clachan), a brilliant museum, monuments, and fountains (the Stewart is a good meeting point). Heading east, check out the Necropolis, last resting place of Victorian grandees. Southwards, the gem is Pollok country park, a lovely day out, even though the unparalleled Burrell Collection is currently closed (till 2020). In the west are the Botanic Gardens, with their fascinating hothouse collection.Given London property prices, you might reasonably expect the city’s green spaces to shrink, not grow. But there have been recent additions, notably Walthamstow Wetlands, a huge area of lakes with 13 miles of trails just a few minutes’ walk from Tottenham Hale station. There is great birdwatching, fishing, cycling and a decent cafe, the Engine House. Also new are the Woodberry Wetlands, a green space that had existed since 1833, but only opened to the public in 2013. Right beside Finsbury Park, it is a good inner-city birding site: you can spot red kites and even marsh harriers. Not exactly new, but renewed, is Burgess Park off the Old Kent Road in Southwark, which recently had an £8m facelift, introducing a bigger lake, new bridge and play areas. Downriver from Greenwich, there are fascinating brownfield parks.Birmingham has hundreds of parks, many of them vast. Kingfisher country park, for example, runs for 11km along the river Cole, while Cannon Hill Park covers around 100 hectares (250 acres). Within that space you have lakes, tennis, golf, playgrounds, running trails and tearooms – this place really can do a full family day out. If you believe that any great park must be in search of a stately home, then try Aston Park – it has a magnificent Jacobean palace. All the above, however, are dwarfed by Sutton Park, a 970-hectare (2,400-acre) national nature reserve six miles north of the centre, which boasts 22 species of butterfly, plus a few rarities. Look out for the startling Camberwell Beauty – unseen since 1996.Holyrood Park certainly has the size (263 hectares650 acres) and the eye-catching eminence of Arthur’s Seat, but this former royal hunting park also leads through to the less well-known Dr Neil’s Garden, a lovely area created by two local GPs who used caravan holidays in Europe as plant-hunting expeditions. Other off-the-beaten track green spaces in Edinburgh include the Archivists’ Garden, one of several small city gardens tucked away from the busy streets. Also check out Dunbar’s Close, a 17th-century garden, and the roof garden at the National Museum of Scotland. About a mile north from the centre is Inverleith Park, which neighbours the magnificent Royal Botanic Garden.Few cities can boast a green space like Cardiff’s Bute Park, a vast expanse of woodland, grass, trails and playgrounds close to the city centre. Its true magic, however, is that it connects, all along the banks of the river Taff, to several other parks: across the Millennium footbridge check out Sophia Gardens – home to Glamorgan Cricket Club, plus cycle hire, horse-riding centre and cafes – then various meadows, parks and gardens all the way north to the M4. Forest Farm country park is worth a visit: the footpath along the old Glamorganshire canal is rich in birdlife, including kingfishers. Also right in the heart of the city is another, much smaller, green space: the Victorian roof garden on top of the Bute Tower in Cardiff Castle.Green may not be the first colour that pops into your mind when thinking of Liverpool, but the city is blessed with great parks. Stanley Park, a classic Victorian creation, separates the Reds and the Blues – the two football grounds of Anfield and Goodison Park. There’s a good cafe in the Isla Gladstone conservatory, plus fishing lake, playground and a red sandstone wall that inspired the Redwall series of children’s books by Brian Jacques. On the other side of the city, check out Sefton Park and Calderstones. From the latter you could walk the mile to another green space: St Peter’s church, Woolton, scene of arguably the most important musical moment in the 20th century: the first public performance by Lennon and McCartney. Also in this quiet churchyard is the gravestone that inspired the Beatles’ Eleanor Rigby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7576bb5d0030f9b78ddea6162c6ab7f6fa7cfd63/0_118_4414_2648/master/4414.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7428df67c25acde2f56214cca76e74ed","title":"which stereo speakers should i buy old hi fi set","story":"Maggie would like some affordable loudspeakers to work with her retro amp, CD player and TVI have a Rotel RA-810A amplifier – recently serviced and in good working order – and a Yamaha CDX-730 CD player but no speakers. They were originally linked to some Tannoys but I didn’t bring them with me from South Africa.I want to be able to play my CDs and DVDs with the speakers linked up to the TV. I’m not a purist and don’t want to pay top price. If you could point me towards a few alternatives, I can then make the decision what to pay. MaggieThe Rotel RA-810A is a classic stereo amplifier from the late 1980s. I remember it as being well made and having a decent sound. However, it does have a couple of drawbacks.First, like all amplifiers from that era, the RCA phono inputs on the back are designed to work with turntables, CD and cassette tape players. While the RA-810A has phono sockets for AVAux, which you can select from the knob on the front, this input has the same spec as the others. There are no digital or HDMI sockets of the sort you would find on a new AV amplifier.Second, the Rotel RA-810A is somewhat underpowered, delivering just 20 watts per channel. This was quickly corrected in later models such as the RA-820AX and RA-930AX. However, it does mean that you will need speakers that are reasonably efficient, or at least easy to drive.The RCA phono socket problem, mentioned above, means that it may be hard to set up the system you want. Worse, there is no general solution, because it depends on the inputs and outputs on your specific products.If you are lucky, your DVD player will have two phono sockets that you can connect to the AVAux sockets on your Rotel amplifier. Problem solved.Alternatively, your TV set may have phono sockets, or at least some form of analogue sound output, such as a headphone jack. In this case, you can connect the DVD player to the TV set by whatever means – an HDMI or SCART cable – and then take the audio output from the TV.This is not quite problem solved, because you may need to use the TV set’s menu system to turn on the analogue phono sockets and disable the built-in speakers. This should be explained in the manual. In fact, if it’s a good manual, it will explain how to connect your TV to a standard amplifier. (If you can’t find it, most manuals are available online in PDF format.)Otherwise, adding a general purpose DAC is the simplest way to enable an old-style amplifier to work with digital services. I covered this in an answer in 2015: How should I upgrade my old hi-fi in a digital world?Most loudspeakers have a sensitivity rating, expressed in decibels (dB). For example, an 88dB loudspeaker will produce 88dB of sound at a distance of one meter when driven with one watt of power.While 88dB is loud, a loudspeaker needs to handle transient peaks up to about 105dB. Music and movies may include dynamic sounds that are very loud for short periods, such as explosions in a blockbuster such as Independence Day. The problem is that you need twice as much power to make the sound just 3dB louder. Powering an 88dB speaker to 106dB would therefore require 64W, and you only have 20W.Worse, it’s a bad idea to drive amps and speakers flat out: it can lead to distortion, clipping, or even equipment failure. It’s better to do 70mph in a car that can cruise at 140mph than in one that’s hitting its limits at 50mph, and an amplifier that has power in reserve will manage transient peaks better than one that’s pushing the limit.In practical terms, you’d only need half as much power to drive a 91dB loudspeaker, while you’d need twice as much power to drive an 85dB speaker.Lower impedance means louder sounds, so in theory you could buy 4-ohm loudspeakers instead. However, your RA-810A is designed to handle 8-16 ohm speakers, so I don’t recommend that.Of course, life is complicated. The impedance of a loudspeaker can vary between 3 ohms and 24 ohms over different frequency ranges, so you can probably get away with a 6-8 ohm rating.It’s a pity you can’t remember which Tannoy speakers you had, because this would tell us the dB rating, and the level of performance you found acceptable.The drawback is that they are not the best specification for your amplifier. They are 6-ohm speakers with a dB rating of only 86dB, when ideally you want 8 ohms90dB. However, Wharfedale Diamonds are generally easy to drive – it’s one of the reasons they’re popular – and they should work fine, if you don’t push them too hard.There are lots of alternatives, and it would be worth popping into a local hi-fi shop, if you have one. Most cater to people who are spending serious amounts of cash, but I’ve happily bought tons of stuff from Richer Sounds.At the moment, Richer Sounds has Wharfedale Diamond 2020 speakers – which What Hi-fi rates above the old Diamond 9.1 version – for £119, Wharfedale Diamond 9.0’s for £49, and Q Acoustics 3010’s for £99. All three are 86dB speakers. Mission LX2 speakers (£149) raise that very slightly to 87dB, but the Richer Sounds sales staff may have better suggestions.Lots of great-sounding old hi-fi systems are being junked by people switching to smaller but worse-sounding systems that work wirelessly with their smartphones, Spotify and similar digital services. There are lots of old Kef, Spendor, Celestion, Monitor Audio, Tannoy and other speakers around. You might even spot some familiar front grills.The first drawback is that old speakers tend to be big by today’s standards, or – like my beloved 82dB LS35a loudspeakers – hard to drive well. The second is that they may have been abused, or are failing as a natural result of old age. You might be able to find a bargain, particularly if you know a hi-fi buff who is willing to help. But if you are shopping for compact speakers at £49 to £99, it may not be worth the effort.Have you got a question?

None have served in Congress – and the possibility of a landmark election is galvanizing voters in New Mexico.“Congress has never heard a voice like mine,” Haaland says in a campaign ad that emphasizes her working-class background and progressive platform.Last month, she soundly defeated five Democratic opponents to win the primary for an open congressional seat in a district that includes Albuquerque, the state’s largest city. In November, she will face the Republican Janice Arnold-Jones, a former state lawmaker, and Lloyd Princeton, a Libertarian candidate, in a general election race that is expected to center on immigration, healthcare – and Donald Trump.“Trump has given many people the courage to be bold in their racism. He gives the white supremacists and the far-right folks cause to be,” she said. The president, Haaland says, is completely ignorant of Native Americans’ place in the country’s history. His repeated attacks on the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, whom he mockingly refers to as “Pocahontas”, are “disgusting and disgraceful”, she said. At a recent rally in Montana, Trump mused that he might “toss” a DNA test at the Massachusetts senator, challenging her claims to Native American ancestry.“First of all, he doesn’t get to decide who’s native,” Haaland said. “And it is extremely disrespectful for him to continue to use the name Pocahontas as a racial slur.” But she said Trump’s policies, even more than his words, posed an urgent threat to Native American land and traditions. Haaland pointed to the administration’s plan to enforce Medicaid work requirements for Native Americans, a move that tribal leaders say would restrict access to healthcare and undermine their sovereignty. She is also alarmed by the administration’s decision to shrink national monuments and roll back federal land protections.The daughter of military veterans, Haaland attended 13 schools before she graduated high school. To pay her way through college, she decorated cakes and started a salsa business. She earned a law degree while raising a daughter as a single mother and working part time at an antique auction shop. At times, her family relied on food stamps, a reality she said many New Mexicans face as the state has one of the highest poverty rates in the country.A longtime activist, who protested the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock and marched with women in Washington, Haaland is running on a progressive platform that includes Medicare for All, a $15 federal minimum wage and universal childcare and pre-K. She also supports calls to eliminate the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency and to impeach Trump. If she wins, Haaland says her top priorities in Washington would be protecting the environment and growing a clean energy economy. She would also fight for more funding and resources to combat violence against women, a scourge that disproportionately affects Native women. Her Republican opponent says voters in the district are more pragmatic than progressive – and that Haaland’s “extreme” positions on border security, oil and gas, and abortion will alienate moderates there.“Quite frankly, the Democratic primary made this a very different election,” Arnold-Jones said. “My opponent is much further left than the district.”Political analysts view it as safely Democratic. Hillary Clinton won the district by more than 16 percentage points and Democrats have held the seat since 2009.Arnold-Jones anticipates Democrats will try to tie her to Trump, but she believes the president’s popularity is on the upswing in New Mexico thanks to a growing economy and the GOP tax cut plan.“It has taken a little bit of time for the state to warm up to him but the result of his policies have been exceptionally positive,” she said, adding: “I actually think if the election were held today, the president would win.”Haaland is part of a broader trend of Native Americans increasingly running for national office, after centuries of systematic persecution, marginalization and disenfranchisement.“Since 1789, we haven’t been able to elect a single Native American woman to Congress,” said Mark Trahant, the editor of Indian Country Today. “That it could finally happen is incredibly important.” Partly driven by opposition to Trump and the #MeToo moment, dozens of Native American women are running for local, statewide and congressional office this year, a cohort that far outpaces past cycles, said Trahant, who is tracking the data. It remains possible Haaland won’t be the only Native American female elected to Congress this year. Sharice Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk nation, is running in a competitive Democratic primary in a swing district in Kansas, and Amanda Douglas, a member of the Cherokee nation, advanced to a runoff election in the Democratic primary for a deeply conservative Oklahoma congressional district.Unlike many of the female candidates running for office in the wake of Trump’s election, this is far from Haaland’s first foray into politics. She worked for years in Democratic politics before an unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor in 2014. She then served as the state party chair.The historic nature of Haaland’s candidacy probably helped distinguish her in a race with little ergence on policy, said Joe Monahan, a longtime New Mexico political blogger. He recalled that New Mexicans elected the Republican Susana Martinez after she reminded voters that she would be “the nation’s first Hiic female governor”.“People like to make history. I don’t think that should be underestimated,” he said.But Haaland’s primary success was not a marginal one, Monahan added. She sailed past her opponents in what was expected to be a competitive race by turning out a coalition of progressive voters that agreed with her on issues such as climate and healthcare.In a Democratic district, she is positioned favorably ahead of the general election. A victory in November would seal her place in American history.“It hasn’t really hit me,” she said. “But every now and then I’ll get a sense from someone else and it makes me emotional because I realize that, for some people, they never thought they would see someone like them in Congress.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aa107c2d14052de2a85ebe3a47741c99661e356/0_335_3261_1956/master/3261.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=200bdb284bfb8ce71985da5dd57dff30","title":"imran khan claims victory in pakistan elections","story":"Former cricketer strikes unifying tone after campaign marred by violence and vote that opponents say was riggedThe former international cricket star Imran Khan has declared victory in Pakistan’s general election, hailing what he described as “the fairest” vote in the country’s history, despite widespread allegations it was rigged in favour of his Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.In a televised address to the nation from his house in Bani Gala, a wealthy suburb of Islamabad, Khan struck a unifying tone, pledging to rise above personal attacks and lift up the poor. With half the vote counted – more than 15 hours after the official result was due – the PTI was projected to win about 120 of the 272 contested seats in the national assembly, leaving it only a few shy of a majority coalition.Early on Thursday morning, Shahbaz Sharif, the leader of the second-placed Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), said his party would “wholly reject” the result. “It is a sheer rigging. The way the people’s mandate has blatantly been insulted, it is intolerable,” Sharif said.Leaders from six major parties alleged that their polling agents – workers who keep an eye on the count – were evicted from ballot-booths by security officials in contravention of electoral rules.Khan said: “I feel that this election has been the fairest in Pakistan’s history. If any party has any doubts, we will open the results of those constituencies up for investigation.”Appearing calm, the 65-year-old promised to improve Pakistan’s governance, widen the tax base and shun the VIP lifestyle of previous rulers. He said he would be “ashamed” to live in the lavish prime minister’s house, and would turn it into an “educational institution”.“His speech will calm people down a bit,” said Asad Liaqat of Harvard University, describing it as Khan’s best in years and in contrast to the “obnoxious victory speech” many would have expected.Although results are not expected to be finalised until late on Thursday evening or early on Friday, the PTI seems likely to make an unprecedented sweep of Pakistan. It stands to control the central government, provincial governments in the crucial province of Punjab and northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as well as holding a dominant position in the southern business capital of Karachi.This means the party will find it easier to implement policies across the nation.“His first priority needs to be macroeconomic stability,” said columnist Mosharraf Zaidi, “and addressing the balance of payments crisis that is staring Pakistan in the face.”The election marked only the second time in Pakistan’s 71-year history that one civilian government has handed power to another in the country of 200 million people. There was, however, still widespread concern during the campaign about manipulation by the military, which has directly or indirectly ruled Pakistan for most of its existence. The PML-N, the party of Shahbaz Sharif’s brother, the jailed former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, repeatedly complained that it was being targeted by the security establishment during the campaign. Khan has staunchly denied allegations by PML-N that he is getting help from the military. The army, which also dismisses allegations of meddling, deployed 371,000 soldiers at polling stations across the country, nearly five times more than the last election in 2013. As voting got under way on Wednesday in the south-western city of Quetta, the Balochistan provincial capital, a suicide bomber attacked a crowded polling station, killing 31 people. Balochistan also saw the worst violence during campaigning earlier this month, when a suicide bomber struck a political rally, killing 149 people.While there was no sign of popular protests on Thursday, Sen Mir Hasil Khan Bezinjo, president of the National party, said that “all major political parties who rejected the vote” would hold a press conference on Friday.The EU’s Election Observation Mission will also give its report on the conduct of the poll on Friday. The results from the respected organisation – which also observed the previous vote in 2013 – are likely to impact what the losing parties do next.Shahbaz Sharif has not been heard from since his firebrand speech on Thursday, and one PML-N insider said that he decided at a party meeting later in the day to protest against the vote in parliament and not on the streets, in a move that reduces the chance of prolonged instability.Complaints have also emerged from Pakistan’s independent human rights commission, which issued a statement saying women had not been allowed to vote in some places. In other areas, it said “polling staff appeared to be biased toward a certain party”, but did not name the party. In the days before the election, the rights activist IA Rehman called the campaign the dirtiest in his country’s troubled journey towards sustained democracy.Provisional results put the liberal Pakistan Peoples party (PPP), led by Bilawal Bhutto, the son of assassinated two-time prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in third place, ahead in 42 constituencies.Far-right religious parties did not make any significant gains, to the relief of many Pakistanis, although Aamir Liaquat Hussain, a controversial TV host banned from screens for inciting violence against minorities, won a seat for the PTI in Karachi.Khan’s success in the election is a stunning rise for the charismatic anti-corruption crusader who has spent much of his political career on the fringes of Pakistani politics. On foreign policy, he lamented on Thursday that Indian media had portrayed him as a “Bollywood villain” ahead of the vote, but said that if Pakistan’s warring neighbour took one step towards peace “we would take two”. He also promised stronger relations with Saudi Arabia and China, while coolly demanding a less “one-sided” relationship with the United States, which he came to political prominence for criticising over its drone strikes in 2011.Analysts noted that Khan’s call for open borders and trade with Afghanistan contrasted with the ongoing, military-led construction of a fence along the Durand Line separating the two nations – an early sighting of potential conflict between the army and the man many term their “blue-eyed-boy”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3577595.1532633185!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"major gas leak reported in drogheda","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tResidents are being urged to take extra care amid reports the escaping gas is odourless.Gardaí are warning of a major gas leak in Drogheda, Co Louth.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WirePreventing an “east-west border” between Northern Ireland and Britain is as non-negotiable for the UK in the Brexit talks as avoiding a “North-South” Border is for the EU, Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer has said. During a rare visit to the North, Mr Hammond said he did not agree with Tánaiste Simon Coveney’s view that the British government could not afford a “no deal Brexit”.“I think there is no doubt that Britain would be better off with a deal than without a deal. But I don’t think we are sliding to towards no deal,” he said. Mr Hammond said the recent British White Paper, which sought to reconcile how to avoid borders, was a “constructive move forward” and could be engaged with by both the British and EU.“I very much hope over next few months we are going to see rapid progress towards a shared vision of what the future relationship can look like and of course putting in place the Irish backstop arrangements which are a crucial part of the overall package.”Mr Hammond said he was sure that the long-running row over the possibility of a hard Border was not being “hyped up”. “One of the challenges we have had over the past few months is getting the EU to understand that no east-west border is as non-negotiable a part of this picture as no North-South border is for them,” he told reporters. “The no east-west border is equally non-negotiable from the point of view of British Conservatives and unionists. I certainly would not be prepared to sign up to any solution that involved an east-west border between Northern Ireland and GB.”As a Remainer during the EU referendum debate, he acknowledged there were tensions on Brexit within the Conservatives but did not think that it would lead to the implosion of the party. He said “no one disagrees with the direction of travel, that we are leaving the EU and seeking to get the best deal we can with the EU”. On the restoration of powersharing, he said that during an earlier meeting with financial services executives in Belfast he “sensed frustration and a concern that if the situation were to go on it would exact a toll on inward investment and confidence by foreign firms who are investing here”.He said US chief executives of firms based in the North also told him it was “very difficult to explain to their corporate leaders in the US what it means and how it works to be in a place that has no political governance”.“We have to go forward, we have to get back to the powersharing arrangements that have delivered such progress over past 20 years.”Mr Hammond’s visit to Belfast and Derry raised suspicions among some nationalists that an attempt was being made to deflect attention from the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which took place in London on Wednesday. The DUP had described the conference as a “talking shop” and some suspected Mr Hammond’s arrival was a sop to the party, which is keeping Theresa May’s government afloat.The chancellor denied this was the case and said he was there to announce £12 million in funding for a Bombardier factory and also to talk to financial services executives and to meet academics at Ulster University in Derry. Mr Hammond said he had invited “a city deal” bid from Derry whereby the local council, university and businesses were given the chance to submit plans to the British government on their priorities for economic growth in the region. The British government already is investing more than £1.6 billion in city deals in Scotland and Wales and is in negotiations for a Belfast city deal."},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Pakistan Election 2018: Imran Khan declares victory as rivals decry \u0026#39rigging\u0026#39Eurotunnel cancels thousands of tickets as UK prepares for \u0026#39Furnace Friday\u0026#39Greek authorities attacked for \u0026#39inability to protect citizens\u0026#39 as inquest begins into botched rescuePolice give sniffer dog extra protection after gangs put £50k price on German Shepherd\u0026#39s headMagazine likens Italy\u0026#39s Salvini to Satan as far-Right leader\u0026#39s row with Catholics continuesBarcelona FC flies female players in economy while men\u0026#39s team get first class treatmentEU\u0026#39s chief negotiator: there are \u0026#39major issues\u0026#39 to deal with in Brexit negotiationsMan who killed his date in speedboat crash hunted by police after skipping trialGwyneth Paltrow says Goop magazine ended after disagreement with publisher over fact-checkingClass A drug use among young people highest in a decade as price of cocaine fallsComment: Everybody lies about their magic number - but while men brag, women choose to forgetFox News joins outrage after CNN reporter banned from White House Trump event for asking questions about Playboy affairRise of unconditional offers gives schools no incentive to raise standards, warns former head of top performing schoolHouse Republicans move to impeach deputy attorney general Rod RosensteinComment: If universities hand out unconditional offers, why bother working hard at all?Italian police evict 450 Roma from camp, despite EU ruling halting demolition Traditional signatures are dying out amid digital revolutionTrump\u0026#39s deal with Juncker was a win for White House PR and a loss for EU credibilityWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

The men\u0027s team always flies in first or business class.Amid a social media outcry, Barcelona FC’s spokesman, Josep Vives, said it regretted the controversy around the issue but insisted it was not of the club’s own making. Photos posted to the female players\u0026#39 Instagram accounts showed their team flying in economyMr Vifes insisted the club’s commitment to women’s sports should be “valued” and that it was working hard for equality and to make the women’s side a “top-level team around Europe”. “We believe that generating a controversy for an issue like this is trying to attack us, he added.Alexia Putellas, a striker for the women’s team, also defended the club. She told El Mundo Deportivo that the decision to add the female side had come after travel arrangements had already been made. The club had made an effort to organise everything at practically the last minute,” Putellas said.But BarcaWomen, a popular fan account on Twitter, questioned why the first class seating could not have been shared between the most senior players on each side. It said that many of the male players were from the B-team - with top players resting following the World Cup - while the women’s side was fielding its best talent. “I will always advocate that a senior professional player - who has given 14 years to the club, many of them without being paid, wearing the badge with pride and honour, and defending the club of herhis life - has more seniority within a club than a newly bought-in B team player,” BarcaWomen explained in one tweet.Writing in the Spanish magazine Sport, Carme Barceló said she believed the controversy was “disproportionate”. However she criticised the club’s decision to release a misleading photo of the captains supposedly travelling in the same class, saying it instead should have “admitted its slip”. The two teams trained together at facilities in Portland before they were due to move on to Los Angeles on Friday.The men’s side is playing in the International Champion’s Cup and will face Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. The women’s team, which this year reached the quarter final of the UEFA Champion’s League in a record performance, are playing friendlies against teams from the US Women’s Premier Soccer LeaguePlease review our commenting policyPakistan Election 2018: Imran Khan declares victory as rivals decry \u0026#39rigging\u0026#39Eurotunnel cancels thousands of tickets as UK prepares for \u0026#39Furnace Friday\u0026#39Greek authorities attacked for \u0026#39inability to protect citizens\u0026#39 as inquest begins into botched rescuePolice give sniffer dog extra protection after gangs put £50k price on German Shepherd\u0026#39s headMagazine likens Italy\u0026#39s Salvini to Satan as far-Right leader\u0026#39s row with Catholics continuesEU\u0026#39s chief negotiator: there are \u0026#39major issues\u0026#39 to deal with in Brexit negotiationsMan who killed his date in speedboat crash hunted by police after skipping trialGwyneth Paltrow says Goop magazine ended after disagreement with publisher over fact-checkingClass A drug use among young people highest in a decade as price of cocaine fallsComment: Everybody lies about their magic number - but while men brag, women choose to forgetFox News joins outrage after CNN reporter banned from White House Trump event for asking questions about Playboy affairRise of unconditional offers gives schools no incentive to raise standards, warns former head of top performing schoolHouse Republicans move to impeach deputy attorney general Rod RosensteinComment: If universities hand out unconditional offers, why bother working hard at all?Italian police evict 450 Roma from camp, despite EU ruling halting demolition Traditional signatures are dying out amid digital revolutionTrump\u0026#39s deal with Juncker was a win for White House PR and a loss for EU credibilityLifetime Isa \u0026#39next mis-selling scandal\u0026#39, experts say as MPs call for abolitionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"eus chief negotiator major issues deal brexit negotiations","story":"The EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said there are \u0027major issues\u0027 to deal with in Brexit negotiations.

For students, they are killers of motivation. “A student given an unconditional offer can hardly be expected to work as hard as they would have for the second part of their a-level course. Even the best school may struggle to motivate that young person, or even get them to come to school.”The number of unconditional offers given to BBB students has soaredFigures from Ucas, the university admissions service, have revealed that almost one in four students - some 24 per cent - who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer in 2017.This figure is far higher than that for top students, which stood at 4.6 per cent for those predicted to get three A*s. In 2010, just 0.9 per cent of students who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer, but this has soared by 23.1 percentage points in seven years. Dr Stephen continued: “Unconditional offers can sometimes put a student at a disadvantage: if a young person has not mastered the demands of a-level, they may not be able to cope with what is expected at university. “They can be seriously damaging to a student who is unsuited either to the course or university itself, as the dropout rate suggests.”This was the fate of one student, Eden Scott. Miss Scott was predicted AAB but dropped one grade to ABB in her final examinations, a result she feels was down to her unconditional offer.The 20-year-old from London said: “I got an unconditional offer to study American and Canadian studies at Birmingham University but that 100 per cent made me stop trying as hard as I should have. “I didn’t even want to study there that much but I just went with the unconditional offer and ended up settling when I really wasn’t that bothered. “I think unconditional offers aren’t a good idea - I know that if I didn’t have one I would have got better grades and probably gone to a university I really wanted to. “Instead I settled for Birmingham and ended up having to pay £9,000 in fees after I dropped out at the start of my second year.”She added that such offers “encourage laziness” and meant “some students aren’t reaching their full potential.”Dr Stephen also raised concerns over the value of degrees which were handing out unconditional offers to their students. Media, technologies and arts courses give out a lot of unconditionalsHe said: “How impressed are employers going to be by a course that you do not have to work for to get into or reach any standard, but which you get into simply by filling in an application form?“The plain truth is that we have too many universities and we need to bring back the Polytechnics. “Nobody – students, schools, the economy – wins from the disgrace of unconditional offers, and a degree so easy to get into is likely to be as valuable as a shady Diploma bought off the internet  – except the latter won’t cost the student, and society, £50,000.”Yesterday the Office for Students confirmed that whilst it would not be appropriate to ban conditional offers they will be looking to ensure the admissions process remains “fair and reliable” and would taken action if necessary. Pakistan Election 2018: Imran Khan declares victory as rivals decry \u0026#39rigging\u0026#39Eurotunnel cancels thousands of tickets as UK prepares for \u0026#39Furnace Friday\u0026#39Greek authorities attacked for \u0026#39inability to protect citizens\u0026#39 as inquest begins into botched rescuePolice give sniffer dog extra protection after gangs put £50k price on German Shepherd\u0026#39s headMagazine likens Italy\u0026#39s Salvini to Satan as far-Right leader\u0026#39s row with Catholics continuesBarcelona FC flies female players in economy while men\u0026#39s team get first class treatmentEU\u0026#39s chief negotiator: there are \u0026#39major issues\u0026#39 to deal with in Brexit negotiationsMan who killed his date in speedboat crash hunted by police after skipping trialGwyneth Paltrow says Goop magazine ended after disagreement with publisher over fact-checkingClass A drug use among young people highest in a decade as price of cocaine fallsComment: Everybody lies about their magic number -

I always sign my initials, for example, so I could prove if it wasn\u0027t me. Meanwhile Keith Elliott, a fraud lawyer at Peters \u0026amp Peters Solicitors, warned that the decreasing need for physical signatures when buying products and services was leading to consumers making rash spending decisions.He said: These days all you have do to enter into a contractual agreement is press a button, but the problem is that people are getting into contractual obligations, often without any idea what they\u0027re doing. Signing a piece of paper makes you stop and think and the absence of that is making people make more rash decisions.Although physical signatures have been phased out of many every day situations, they are still required for important documents such as wills, where a witness is also required. However earlier this year the Land Registry announced a new dawn of “digital mortgages” as it is moving the process online to save time and hassle for millions of homeowners. A new online verification service which phases out the need for signature witnesses and posting pieces of paper is due to be rolled out this summer.Steve Roberts of Online Spy Shop said: We’re now so used to engaging with modern means of verification, be that fingerprint recognition or simply passwords and PINs, that the idea of just scribbling our name seems almost ridiculous.  So it’s no surprise that a significant proportion of us no longer have a definitive, consistent signature to call our own and many of us can’t even remember the last time we signed our own name.Pakistan Election 2018: Imran Khan declares victory as rivals decry \u0026#39rigging\u0026#39Eurotunnel cancels thousands of tickets as UK prepares for \u0026#39Furnace Friday\u0026#39Greek authorities attacked for \u0026#39inability to protect citizens\u0026#39 as inquest begins into botched rescuePolice give sniffer dog extra protection after gangs put £50k price on German Shepherd\u0026#39s headMagazine likens Italy\u0026#39s Salvini to Satan as far-Right leader\u0026#39s row with Catholics continuesBarcelona FC flies female players in economy while men\u0026#39s team get first class treatmentEU\u0026#39s chief negotiator: there are \u0026#39major issues\u0026#39 to deal with in Brexit negotiationsMan who killed his date in speedboat crash hunted by police after skipping trialGwyneth Paltrow says Goop magazine ended after disagreement with publisher over fact-checkingClass A drug use among young people highest in a decade as price of cocaine fallsComment: Everybody lies about their magic number - but while men brag, women choose to forgetFox News joins outrage after CNN reporter banned from White House Trump event for asking questions about Playboy affairRise of unconditional offers gives schools no incentive to raise standards, warns former head of top performing schoolHouse Republicans move to impeach deputy attorney general Rod RosensteinComment: If universities hand out unconditional offers, why bother working hard at all?Italian police evict 450 Roma from camp, despite EU ruling halting demolition Trump\u0026#39s deal with Juncker was a win for White House PR and a loss for EU credibilityLifetime Isa \u0026#39next mis-selling scandal\u0026#39, experts say as MPs call for abolitionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/26/TELEMMGLPICT000139044140_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqniLs_ck1w-iIu15kYzVq2d6IZZiXNIhc2shoXJuYYgE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"universities hand unconditional offers bother working hard","story":"Killers of motivation: unconditional offers from British universities have risen by 32 per cent in the last yearThe news that soaring numbers of unconditional university offers are being made to school leavers is a disaster for UK education.

So she started oneClick to followThe Independent OnlineAtes is also the author of 2009 book ‘Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution’, and has required police protection ever sinceSeyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I can’t understand how some people hate rollercoasters\u0026nbsp– they are one of my favourite things in the entire world.Theme parks around the worldMeet famous characters and get your autograph book signedLego statues of all sizes - from miniland to life size modelsFerrari Land in Port Aventura, Spain, is famous for its fast rollercoastersOakwood is the only theme park in Wales and is home to Megafobia, voted the best ride in the UK and third best ride in the world by the Roller Coaster Club of Great Britain.

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s. He started by adding a few slides to accompany his restaurant – and it grew from there.Around the world there are a whole host of niche theme parks – those interested can visit Hello Kitty’s castle in Japan, unearth mud at Diggerland\u0026nbspin various locations across the UK and US and view a host of farting and vomiting statues\u0026nbspat BonBon-Land in Zealand, Denmark.Of course, obscurities aside, you’re still guaranteed to have fun at your local attraction. And increasingly we’re seeing theme park culture enter\u0026nbspour day-to-day – less traditional workplaces are starting to install slides and ball pits and Penn State station in New York is considering adding a rollercoaster alongside it’s shops and subway platforms.It would do us all some good to get out the office and have some fun for the sake of fun –\u0026nbspor even better\u0026nbspwe could incorporate theme park rides and attractions into our daily lives.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

More than one in five detainees are held for at least two months.In the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Javid told MPs he wanted a detention policy “based on not only what works to tackle illegal migration, but what is humane for those who are detained” and promised that he would “further consider the issue of time limits on immigration detention”.His announcement followed the publication of a second review of the UK’s immigration detention system by former prisons and probation ombudsman Stephan Shaw, which found people were being locked in “unacceptable” conditions, often for “deeply troubling” lengths of time.While there has been a drop in the overall detainee population, the number of people held in removal centres for more than six months has increased. The Home Office’s strategy of expanding capacity by adding extra beds into existing rooms had “exacerbated overcrowding, and created unacceptable conditions”, the review found.In response to the findings, Mr Javid said it confirmed the government was on the “right track” in improving detention, but conceded that there were also areas where ministers “could and should do better”.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A customs union, which would help to reduce friction at the border, would come with our common commercial policy for goods.”The comments represent the first time Mr Barnier has definitively rejected the proposal in the UK’s white paper. Last week he subjected the policies\u0026nbspto a series of intensive questions, but was careful not to definitively rule anything out – though he suggested they may not be legally feasible.The proposal by the UK is a bid to remove the need for customs checks on goods travelling between the UK and EU, without committing\u0026nbspto being a member of an actual customs union.The EU cannot and the EU will not delegate the application of its customs policy, of its rules, VAT and excise duty collections to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU’s governance structuresIt would have seen British customs staff charge both British and EU tariffs on goods entering the UK, whichever was the highest, based on what the expected final destination of the good was.It sits alongside a UK proposal to align itself with some of the EU’s single market rules, in order to remove the need for border checks on goods and preserve frictionless trade after Brexit.The EU has also raised serious questions about that plan, suggesting it would give the UK a significant competitive advantage over Europe without any advantage for EU states.Readers’ view: The Independent’s campaign for a Brexit referendumIndependent petition for vote on final Brexit deal hits 210,000Britain could cancel Brexit and stay in EU on same terms, France saysMay tells UK not to worry about Brexit amid plans to stockpile foodSpeaking on Thursday at the same press conference, Mr Barnier\u0026nbspre-stated that the EU’s single market and its four freedoms were inisible and could not be cherry-picked.British and EU negotiators held meetings about the future relationship this week, as well as well as the remaining withdrawal agreement issues and the Northern Ireland “backstop”.It is the so-called\u0026nbspbackstop that is causing the biggest risk of a no-deal Brexit, with the problem apparently intractable. Theresa May has said “no UK prime minister” could sign up to the EU’s plan to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and single market in order to avoid a hard border in Ireland, while the EU has said the UK’s proposals do not go far enough to prevent a hard border.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

It should be your #Finalsay.”Theresa May\u0026nbsphas urged voters not to worry about\u0026nbspBrexit, despite her government setting out plans to stockpile food, blood and medicine in case it goes badly.She said people should take “reassurance and comfort” from news of the plans, to be implemented if the UK crashes out of the EU without an agreement in March next year.It came after health secretary Matt Hancock admitted he had already met with industry leaders\u0026nbspto discuss building up NHS reserves\u0026nbspof vaccinations, medical devices, clinical consumables and blood products if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal.Dominic Raab, the new Brexit secretary, also recently\u0026nbspconfirmed preparations were being made to stockpile food, as ministers ramp up planning in case the negotiations fail.Mr Blair follows a string of other politicians baking the Independent’s campaign, including ex-attorney general\u0026nbspDominic Grieve\u0026nbspwho said another referendum is “the sensible way forward”, Labour’s Chuka Umunna, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, ex Labour spinner Alistair Campbell and Gina Miller.The push was launched with\u0026nbspa major editorial\u0026nbspon Tuesday night which set out why a Final Say is needed for the British people.33m+ people voted in the EU referendum wanting a better country, not to be poorer, not to put further pressure on our already stretched health service, not for job losses or to stockpile food and medicines.It read: “The British people decided to pursue our course in the referendum of 2016, so as we now look for a decision on whether we will like the deal agreed with the EU (assuming there is one), it is natural that those same people should have the final say.“Indeed, given the magnitude of the decision, it would be essential for the British people to be given that final right of approval, even if cabinet and parliament were providing the leadership we need, which they are not.”The most recent polling shows that amid the chaos of the Brexit process, the largest number of people in the UK would prefer to simply remain in the EU, if forced to choose between staying or going.The survey undertaken by BMG Research asked some 1,500 people in a balanced cross-section of the public: “should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union, or leave the European Union?”Some 49 per cent said “remain”, while 43 per cent said “leave”, 7 per cent said they did not know and 1 per cent refused to answer.When those who did not give a clear answer the first time were asked which way they are “leaning towards most”, a total of 51 per cent said “remain”, and 45 per cent said “leave”, while 5 per cent still said they did not know or refused to answer.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Michel Barnier does not represent only the Commission. He is the negotiator for the European Union,” she said.“He gets his mandate and his guidelines from the heads of state and government. And we have discussed it regularly at the level of ministers. We meet with Michel Barnier on a regular basis.\u0026nbsp“So do the heads of state and government.

The former cricket star\u0027s PTI party are projected to comfortably win Wednesday\u0027s vote, though fall short of an outright majority.In his televised speech, Mr Khan vowed to create the new Pakistan he promised on the campaign trail. He said he would pursue strong relations with\u0026nbspChina as well as vowing to try to develop relations with the US based on our mutual benefit. Mr Khan has previously criticised Pakistan\u0027s close military allegiance with Washington.And Mr Khan\u0026nbspcited the Prophet Muhammad as his inspiration, saying\u0026nbsphe would transform or found Pakistan as an Islamic state in the model of Muhammad\u0027s Medina.Pakistan\u0027s election commission has not yet declared official results, but PTI\u0026nbspwere leading in 120 of 270 National Assembly constituencies with 49 per cent of polling stations reporting, and held a commanding lead in almost all TV stations\u0027 projections.The sluggish nature of the count - officials had claimed\u0026nbspwe would have a final result by 2am on Thursday morning - has led losing parties\u0026nbspto call foul play.In a message from his prison cell, the former prime minister and Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PML-N) leader Nawaz\u0026nbspSharif said: The people\u0027s mandate has been stolen.All party leaders should now decide what course they are going to take. The Muslim League stands firm on its message of\u0026nbsp\u0027vote ko azat do\u0027 (respect the vote).Mr Khan addressed those concerns in his speech, saying: I feel that this election has been the fairest in Pakistan\u0027s history.The electoral commission\u0026nbspchief had earlier dismissed any claims of rigging, saying the slow count was down to a failure in the electronic\u0026nbspsystem, and Mr Khan pointed out the body was created by two major political parties, the PML-N and the PPP - the parties which came second and third in Wednesday\u0027s vote, respectively.If you think there has been rigging, we will assist you in the investigation if you have any doubts, Mr Khan said. If any party has any doubts, we will open the results of those constituencies up for investigation.The country will be plunged into a crisis situation if the commission cannot convince all parties the election was fair, warned Ahmad Bilal Mehboob, president of the leading think-tank the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT).He said the fact that all Pakistan\u0027s five other main political parties were united against\u0026nbspPTI\u0026nbspcould cause political turmoil. Led by the incumbent PML-N\u0026nbspparty of jailed Mr Sharif, they have all\u0026nbspagreed to stand together to oppose the result, all with\u0026nbspthe same criticisms that the count was unacceptably delayed and their agents at polling stations were not allowed to verify many of the results.But before even half the votes were counted, Mr Khan\u0027s leading rival Shahbaz Sharif, who heads the PML-N\u0026nbspwith his brother in jail -\u0026nbsprejected the vote, generating fears that the losers could delay the formation of the next government. Television projections give his party about 61 seats.Shahbaz Sharif said that our democratic process has been pushed back by decades, adding that had the public mandate been delivered in a fair manner, we would have accepted it happily.Complaints have also emerged from the independent Human Rights Commission, which issued a statement saying that in some places women were not allowed to vote.Khan leads as bloodshed and \u0027foul play\u0027 taint historic Pakistan voteFears for worst \u0027no matter who wins\u0027 after brutal Pakistan campaignHere\u0027s what we can expect of Pakistan\u0027s likely new leader, Imran KhanPakistan prepares for elections amid concerns over bulk voting In other areas, it said polling staff appeared to be biased toward a certain party, without naming the party.In the days before Wednesday\u0027s election, leading rights activist IA Rehman called the campaign the dirtiest in his country\u0027s troubled journey towards sustained democracy. If Mr Khan can form a government, it will be the first time Pakistan has ever managed a second successive democratic transition of power.Regardless, Mr Khan\u0027s message of a new Pakistan does appear to have resonated with young voters in a country where 64 per cent\u0026nbspof its 200 million people are below the age of 30.Outlining his plans on Thursday evening, in what was his first public speech since the campaign trail, Mr Khan fleshed out his vision for what a new country would look like.He said he would beat corruption in the form of tax avoidance by letting people see that their taxes are being spent on them.\u0026nbspI pledge to our people that I will introduce a system that is for the masses - all policies will be for the people, he said.Mr Khan vowed not to move into the official prime ministerial residence, saying it would be converted into an educational institution or something of the sort. I would be ashamed to live in such a large house, he said.And despite the vitriolic nature of his comments towards India on the campaign trail, he struck a conciliatory tone, saying that if we want to fight against poverty then we and India have to develop trade ties. He said that he was the Pakistani who knows the Indian people more than anyone. In his previous incarnation as a playboy celebrity, Mr Khan has dated a number of Bollywood stars.\u0026nbspCelebrations that really began on Wednesday night among Khan supporters are now expected to be injected with new vigour, and a number of parties were planned at local PTI\u0026nbspoffices across the country for Thursday night.\u0026nbspRevellers danced to the sound of beating drums draped in Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf\u0027s black and green-coloured flags - excited by the prospect of the political change they voted for.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He has also been accused of trying to appease Islamist parties, earning him the nickname “Taliban Khan”.What will PTI’s win mean for the second largest Islamic country in the world?According to Mosharraf Zaidi, a political commentator, Pakistan is “a highly ided country” and Mr Khan would be well advised to behave in a manner that does not further aggravate the situation. But according to Mr Zaidi, he has often been known to be “extremely petty, vindictive and off the cuff”.PTI will now need to form a coalition, despite appearing to have won a substantial amount of seats.Mr Khan’s supporters outside his house – many of them young Pashtuns from the country’s troubled tribal areas – had high expectations of the change he had promised to bring.“He has promised he will give approximately 10 million jobs to Pakistanis,” Jawad Khan, 19, from Waziristan said. “He will manage. It will be a great change.”According to Mr Zaidi, Mr Khan and his party will have no choice but to act swiftly.“They’ll be competing with a very strong and robust scrutiny, not only from the opposition parties but from Pakistan’s vocal and boisterous commentary which will be looking very carefully to judge whether or not Imran Khan’s promises of change have any substance or not.”But some of Mr Khan’s moves over the last few years have possibly deterred some former supporters.He has promised he will give approximately 10 million jobs to Pakistanis\u0026nbspMadeeha Dogar, a 30-year-old mother from Islamabad, had been an enthusiastic supporter of Mr Khan in the 2013 elections. Now, she says she has changed her mind.“My major concern is him trying to wipe out corruption from other parties and his stance against Nawaz Sharif, but he himself is doing the same thing.”Nevertheless, had she been able to travel to Islamabad from Karachi to cast her vote on Wednesday, she might still have voted for PTI. “He is the lesser of two evils,” she said.Some have raised concerns about Mr Khan’s stance on foreign policy and a possible turn for the worse in Pakistan’s relations with its neighbours and allies.Imran Khan declares victory in Pakistan electionThe World Cup-winning cricket captain hoping to become Pakistan’s PMMajor party accuses authorities of ‘deliberate’ voter suppressionHere’s what we can expect of Pakistan’s likely new leader, Imran KhanIn the past, he has been highly critical of the US war on terror and Pakistan’s involvement in it.\u0026nbspBut his Pashtun supporters applauded his stance.“Imran Khan was the first one to protest about drone attacks in Waziristan,” Amir Khan Wazir, a 24-year-old PTI supporter from the tribal areas, said.In his speech on Thursday, Mr Khan called for a more balanced relationship with the US and said friendship with India was in the best interests of both countries.Mr Zaidi does not believe there will be any major changes to Pakistan’s foreign policy after Mr Khan comes into power, although he has been known to “fly off the handle” and “be imperious at times,” he said. \u0026nbspThe country’s powerful military, which has ruled over the country for almost half of its history, has been accused of backing Mr Khan in the elections, and many had concerns about the presence of the army inside polling stations.“If he’s a puppet of the military, then Pakistan’s policies, which are dominated by the military as it is, will not change,“ said Mr Zaidi.“If he is not a puppet of the military then the question is, does he have fundamentally different views about foreign policy vis-a-vis the US, Afghanistan and India? In the main it doesn’t seem that he does. His views seem to be quite well aligned with the military’s views.”But Mr Khan’s unpredictable behaviour will likely create hurdles for Pakistan’s diplomats, according to Mr Zaidi.Quetta, PakistanMr Khan has also taken some conservative stances regarding women’s rights and defended the country’s controversial blasphemy laws.But according to Mr Zaidi, it is not likely that Pakistan will take a more conservative turn now.“I think there’s no real substance to the fears that he is particularly more conservative or extreme than for example the PML-N and its leadership,” he said.All in all, Mr Khan’s victory was largely brought about by the 20 million new voters that had registered this time, Mr Zaidi said.“The method of registering voters changed from voluntarily registering to anybody who has a national identity card automatically being registered to vote. The vast majority of the increase in the numbers are young people,” he said.“Pakistan is an incredibly young country and will continue to be young over the next two decades.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The men\u0027s wives followed - Meghan, looking stylish in an outfit by Carolina Herrera, and Delfina Blaquier.The final members of their group were Sentebale\u0027s chief executive Cathy Ferrier and the organisation\u0027s chairman Johnny Hornby.The sporting fixture has become an important annual event raising funds and awareness for Sentebale, an organisation which works with children and teenagers in Lesotho and Botswana who are coming to terms with being HIV positive, have Aids or have lost their parents to the disease.Later, Harry will play on the Sentebale St Regis team, captained by Mr Figueras, against the Royal Salute team, captained by Malcolm Borwick.A 2004 gap year trip to the landlocked African nation of Lesotho inspired the duke to set up his charity two years later with the country\u0027s Prince Seeiso, younger brother of King Letsie III.Their aim was to help youngsters in need and other children who had lost one or both parents to Aids or contracted the disease themselves.In November 2015, Sentebale opened its \u0026pound2 million Mamohato Children\u0027s Centre in Lesotho to scale up its Mamohato camps, a residential project providing psychological, social and practical support to children struggling to cope with being HIV positive."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/brexit-news-uk-eu-theresa-may-michel-barnier-white-paper-jacob-rees-mogg-994659.jpg","title":"Brexit news Michel Barnier EU UK Theresa May Jacob Rees Mogg amendment","story":"Brexit news: Michel Barnier warned peers Commons amendments increase no deal risk (Image: )The European Commission\u0026rsquos chief Brexit negotiator told members of the House of Lord\u0026rsquos EU Committee amendments tabled by Mr Rees-Mogg\u0026rsquos influential eurosceptic European Research Group only increase the opportunity of a no deal scenario.In order to avoid a catastrophic defeat to the Government\u0026rsquos Customs Bill, Mrs May ushered through four amendments backed by the 60-strong band of Brexiteer Tory MPs.Mr Barnier believes the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos decision only adds to the chances of a no deal Brexit because the legislative alterations lessen her negotiating hand.The EU\u0026rsquos negotiator met with representatives from the House of Lord\u0026rsquos EU Committee on July 17 as part of his Brexit negotiation information gathering.

The spread of social media and other online communication, with its inherent anonymity, has only increased the misery for victims.But the speed of change has not been matched by a more robust framework to deal with it.Yes, we have tougher sentences — the Government was absolutely right to last year double jail terms for the worst cases from five to ten years.But progress has been too slow in recognising these crimes.In 2016-17, fewer than 1,000 prosecutions were commenced under stalking legislation.It was horrifying to read the account of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud yesterday.She told how she faced a barrage of more than 3,000 texts over five years from an ex-boyfriend, including threats to stab and burn her.Soon after being handed a lifetime restraining order, her ex began following her on Instagram.He “wanted me to know he was still watching me”, she said, chillingly.And yet the CPS saw no realistic chance of a successful prosecution for stalking because the social media activity was not taken sufficiently seriously, despite the obvious impact on Nicola’s life.As she put it: “I should be able to move on from an unhealthy relationship if I want and that’s not been able to happen.”She wants change — and she is right to.These kinds of messages leave you in fear for your life — feeling that someone is watching or following you is immensely distressing.A bunch of flowers is not a romantic gesture when sent by a stalker but a reminder that your persecutor is still watching and can still reach you.Stalking is a crime of obsession and fixation and it needs to be stopped before it becomes deeply ingrained.No legislation will be effective unless it is accompanied by training at the front line of policing and across the wider courts system.Victims must have the confidence to come forward at an earlier stage, for all forms of stalking to be recognised for what they are. It is my intention to make this happen.My Stalking Protection Bill will introduce so-called Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) to help fill some of the gaps in the law.It will allow the police to act more quickly and to protect victims of so-called stranger stalking, where the stalker is not a former partner.Importantly, it will also take the onus off the victim to have to take action, as is currently the case for stranger stalking. At present many victims are left unprotected because they have to put protective measures in place for themselves, such as applying for a civil injunction to restrain someone from harassing them.Needless to say, many victims find this such a daunting task — not to mention expensive and time-consuming — that they end up not going through with it.If passed, the Stalking Protection Bill would allow the police to apply for an SPO through the magistrates’ courts on behalf of victims.Orders will require the civil standard of proof “on the balance of probabilities” but breach of an order would be a criminal offence, punishable in the most serious cases by a term of up to five years in prison.SPOs could set out requirements prohibiting certain behaviours, such as contacting the victim either directly or indirectly.It would be able to prohibit behaviours such as driving past the victim’s house, harassing friends, colleagues or family members, going within a certain distance of the victim or following them online.It could also set out so called positive requirements, such as attending a psychiatric assessment.In this digital age, the law would cover online contact from abroad and require that any IT equipment would be free from encryption, so perpetrators could not cover their tracks.Unlike the now-abandoned Police Information Notices, SPOs will have teeth, as they would be enforceable and breaching the terms of an order would have consequences.SPOs would also require stalkers to register all the names they use, as well as their address.While SPOs will provide better early intervention to protect victims, they are not intended to replace full prosecution for an offence of stalking.They will, however, enable police to better protect the safety of victims while gathering the full evidence for the CPS to prosecute a full stalking case.The Bill has almost completed its Commons journey but will not now return to the Chamber until late November.When the case for change is so pressing, and the Bill is backed by members across the House, I believe the Government should bring forward the final Commons stage so we can get on with delivering this vital change to the law — which will help to save lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh, let me count the ways. And believe me, it goes waaaay past ten.In fact, there are so many I feel it easier to group them together under various categories.

Unless it’s me, of course.Believe me, I’m just scratching the surface here.Send me your irritations and I’ll print the best next week.Meghan Markles unpleasant half-sister Samantha is at it again – this time berating her understandably estranged royal relative for paying tribute to Nelson Mandela.“How about you pay tribute to your own father?” she ranted. “Enough is enough.Act like a humanitarian, act like a woman.If our father dies, I’m holding you responsible, Meg.”What a Grade A nasty.Meanwhile, last week Meghan’s father Thomas spent his 74th birthday picking up a Happy Meal from fast-food joint McDonald’s.Which, considering he’s just had heart stents fitted to help clear clogged arteries, suggests that if he dies any time soon, the only person responsible would be him.High-end designer ­Burberry junks £28million of unwanted products each year.A Burberry source has denied claims that they don’t donate it to charity because they don’t want the “wrong people” ­wearing it, saying that the destruction is actually to ­protect the brand against counterfeiting. Hmmm.The fakes ­market will always ­flourish irrespective of how many originals are pulped.So why doesn’t ­Burberry donate the items to upmarket charity ­auctions where people can bid a lot of money for something they might have bought anyway and have the extra thrill of knowing their cash will go to a deserving cause?Model David Gandy says he was once chucked out of a Hugo Boss catwalk show “because I couldn’t fit any of the clothing”.But luckily for the legion of Mr Gandy’s female fans, he can clearly still squeeze his, ahem, lardy self in to a teeny tiny pair of ­Y-fronts.Nope, still not going to wear them.Former Olympic showjumper Lizzie Purbrick has been telling her side of the story after being convicted of criminal damage for spraying her former lover’s home with several litres of pig’s blood.As you do.Lizzie, 63, says that initially, her relationship with Tory peer Lord Prior was “bloody marvellous” after they “met at a dinner party in Norfolk – the hotbed of sex – and I moved in with him four days later.”Whoa. Hang on, rewind that. Genteel Norfolk a hotbed of sex?And lo and behold, two days after this revelation, a survey by our sister paper The Sun on Sunday revealed that the nookie capital of Britain is…drum roll…Norfolk.So quite what they’re putting in the water up there is anyone’s guess.But something tells me house prices are suddenly set to rise.Charlie, 45, told his brother Matthew on the phone: “I’d really like to go out for a bottle of wine. I’ve been let out for a cigarette but I’m very bored.”We’ll take that as a no, then.Activity badges for Guides, Rangers and Brownies have been revamped for the 21st Century.You’ll be relieved to know Moped Mugging isn’t one of them, but there’s “Mixology” which involves designing a menu of non-alcoholic cocktails, “Festival Goer”, Vlogging, Mindfulness, Human Rights, Conscious ­Consumer and Media Critic (everyone’s a bloody critic.) Cripes.During my brief time as a Brownie in the late Sixties, I only achieved the “Hostess” badge, which entailed making a cup of tea for some visiting dignitaries at our local community centre and helping an elderly woman across the road.She didn’t want to go but, hey, a badge is a badge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The 27 EU states, or most of them at any rate, might individually want good relations with us.But, in Brussels, there are plenty of officials who would rather see all sides suffer than watch Brexit succeed.If their view prevails, the implications go well beyond Brexit. For 70 years, Britain has been a European power.Although we kept our military ties with the other English-speaking democracies, our focus was the defence of Europe. It still is.There are, for example, British soldiers patrolling the borders of Poland and Estonia.The RAF is, to all intents and purposes, acting as Romania’s air force, responding to incursions into that country’s airspace. And so on.In intelligence and security, rather as with the Common Fisheries Policy, Britain puts a lot more than its share into the common pot.We have done so cheerfully because we saw European states as our allies, and felt that we had a stake in their security. But what if that feeling is no longer reciprocated?Visiting Germany on Monday, Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, pointed out in measured and polite language that the EU could not expect to treat Britain aggressively without consequences.Now Mr Hunt is no Little Englander. He is an entrepreneur who made his money from language courses, is married to a Chinese woman and, after some soul-searching, came down on the side of Remain.But what he said is impossible to argue with. If the EU chooses to treat Brexit as a hostile act, the basis of European security will be undone — at the very moment that Donald Trump has made it clear that America is no longer interested in defending Europe.In almost every European speech since the referendum, Theresa May has said that she wants Britain to be the EU’s closest friend and strongest ally.But when have you ever heard those good wishes returned?The PM keeps saying she wants the EU 27 to succeed. EU leaders keep saying they want Brexit to fail.They mean it. Eurocrats are not offering Britain the kind of deal that they have with neighbours such as Norway and Switzerland.They think UK will just swallow what’s offered.If we want to remain in the single market, says chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, then, unlike those countries, we’d have to give Brussels 100 per cent control of our trade policy — an impossible condition.But neither are they offering the kind of simple free trade deal that they have with, say, Canada and Japan.If we want a straightforward trade deal, Barnier says, we’d have to leave Northern Ireland under EU rules — an equally impossible condition.In other words, Britain won’t be allowed the friendly relations with the EU that other democracies take for granted.It is not for a lack of willingness on our side. In February, Theresa May told a Munich audience: “Europe’s security is our security. And that is why I say that the United Kingdom is unconditionally committed to maintaining it.”The EU’s response? To exclude us from the Galileo satellite programme on grounds that we could no longer be trusted.Well, fine. I never saw much point in the Galileo system, which was pushed by French leader Jacques Chirac to challenge the “technological imperialism” of America’s GPS system.Britain should now either go in with the Americans or create its own satellite system, possibly with friendly states such as Australia and Canada.But the point is, the EU’s logic goes well beyond satellites.If Brussels no longer sees us as an ally, we can hardly carry on behaving like one unilaterally, so to speak.While we talk of trade and co-operation, EU negotiators talk of border queues and grounded flights.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, even threatens to close his airspace.If such thinking wins out, we shall have no choice but to leave Europe to itself and turn our faces, as our ancestors did, to the open seas.That is not an outcome anyone should want, but we shall be ready if it comes.Understandably enough, you might say, given what feeble negotiators we have been so far.

I’ve never seen anything like it in my lifetime.”The nugget is safely locked up in a deposit box as he is still undecided what to do with it. And the location where it was discovered is a closely guarded secret.Gold panning expert Leon Kirk said: “This is a very exciting and unprecedented find.“I would say it is worth at least £50,000 but, as it’s rarer than a Aston Martin or a Faberge egg, a billionaire could easily come along and pay a lot more for it.“Historically, it is off the Richter scale.”There are three “gold belts” in Scotland — around the Lowther Hills near Wanlokhead and Leadhills in Galloway Tyndrum in Perthshire and at Helmsdale in Sutherland.Dr Neil Clark, author of Scottish Gold: Fruit Of The Nation, believes there could be more gold around the secret area where the Douglas Nugget was found.He said: “The rounded edges of the piece indicate that it has certainly been in the watercourse for a while.“The size of the nugget suggests that it probably did not travel far, though.”But he added: “The fact that we have waited over 500 years for this nugget suggests it may be difficult to find another comparable one in the near future.”Prior to the Douglas Nugget, the previous record holder for the biggest gold nugget to be found in British waters dates back to 1808.This was a 59g lump discovered in Cornwall.In 2016, a 97g nugget was found off the coast of Anglesey by Vincent Thurkettle.However, experts later concluded that it had originated from Australia and gone down with the steam clipper Royal Charter.The boat, laden with gold, sank when it was hit by a hurricane while sailing from Melbourne to Liverpool in 1859."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000422824175.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the met office can stick advice where sun doesnt shine let us enjoy the heat while it lasts","story":"You get a lovely chill from the cotton. OK, later you might find a hash brown stuck halfway up your bottom, but it’s worth it, just for the pleasantly cool sensation.It’s been a lovely summer, the best that I can remember since 1976. That summer was the happiest time of my life. But this hasn’t been bad, has it?But there are downsides to the driest and warmest spell we’ve had for years.Public transport isn’t always much fun, especially if you’re crunched up on the Tube next to a large bearded lady who last washed when hula hoops were all the rage.If you live in the country, there are mosquitoes — I’ve got bites in ­places I ­forgot existed.Work can be a bit of a chore. And if you’re a smoker, the pub gardens are suddenly full of tossers who waft their hands around if the smoke goes anywhere near them.Where were you when it was snowing, huh? I was there, lighting my Superking in a blizzard, while you were tucked away inside.But the hot weather is very good for us.There’s a link between clear, sunny days and good health — mental as well as physical.People feel better about themselves and tend to spend more money, which is good for the economy.OK, crime rates tend to increase when the weather is hot — more precisely, when the temperature ­hovers between 28C and 32C, according to psychologists.But on the whole, this summer — a proper summer, at last — is something to be enjoyed, cherished and remembered. We don’t have them very often.We can admire the women walking around with not many clothes on and laugh at the men dressed in toddler shorts with beer bellies hanging down to their knees.We can relax with a beer and forget about bloody Brexit for a while.The authorities think of nice summers as altogether something very different.For them, nice summers are a crisis.That’s why those tiresome drongos at the Met Office put out an amber alert when the temperature rose this week.“Don’t go out! Stay in your homes! Or you will die — DIE, I tell you.”Oh, with the greatest respect — f*** off!We’ll go out when and where we please, thank you, so you can stuff your advice where the sun isn’t shining.And, of course, the climate change ­monkeys are in full voice.“This is it! The end of the world! Look at the incredible temperatures and those wildfires in poor Greece. We told you!”Give it a rest. I think there is something to global warming. I am not a denier. But I remember the last few ­summers we’ve had — rainy and cool — and the climate change monkeys saying THAT was a consequence of global ­warming, too. You can’t have it both ways.And there have been wildfires in hot, dry areas for the past 100,000 years.So enjoy this wonderful heatwave while you can. Because someday, quite soon, it will be gone and the rain and the cold will be back, and the Christmas adverts will start appearing in supermarkets.And this summer will just be ­something you talk about in years to come. Remember the summer of 2018? Wasn’t it brilliant? If only we could have it again.Carlos Delacruz was in court in Scotland accused of having sex with two women with something other than a penis.The lasses THOUGHT it was his todger. But then, the lights were off.And the sad truth is that Mr Delacruz does not have a penis. Not even a small one.The women complained the sex was painful. So what was it, then?It was referred to in court as an “unknown object”.Here are my guesses:Incidentally, the prosecuting lawyer was called Ms Cockburn.No kidding, love.NO sooner has the World Cup finished than the domestic football season is about to begin.And with it the endless round of transfer speculation.If you’re still wondering why England didn’t win the World Cup, check out how many top foreign teams are trying to buy our players.None. None whatsoever.All the sides we played against in the final stages had players at Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich etc.That’s because they are very good players.But none of the top European clubs wants Harry or Dele or Raheem.We are a lot further behind than many people think.LABOUR MP and fervent Brexiteer Kate Hoey received the following email from a man called Robert Crangle.“I have never written to an MP before. I just want to say that you are a f***ing disgrace for helping to keep the Tories in power. I hope you die soon.”Lefty Remainers are a lovely bunch, aren’t they?IS it actually the law that all pop musicians must end up skagged out of their heads and taken to hospital?And then, if they survive, check into some poncey rehab clinic and tell their fans they are “fighting my demons”.And then come out of rehab and get skagged out of their heads again.The latest is Demi Lovato.I must admit I’m not a huge fan, but still.First time we knew anything was amiss was when she forgot the lyrics to one of her songs. The track was called Sober.So let’s wish her a speedy recovery from whatever foul substance laid her low.And remind pop singers that nobody looks cool in a pine box.THE Palestinian Authority has just revealed that at least half of the money it receives in aid goes to funding vile acts of terrorism against Israel. One Hamas bomber even pocketed £100,000.Please, think carefully and do your homework before giving money to charities working in Palestine.The British Government has already stopped aid to the Palestinian Authority. It’s time these Islamist thugs had the plug pulled on their slush fund from naive Westerners.LATEST news from the front line of scientific research on . . . crows.Apparently these birds are fond of a bit of necrophilia.Experts Dr John Marzluff and Kaeli Swift professed themselves “surprised” to seeing crows trying to have sexual intercourse with dead members of their species.The pair put this down to confusion caused by hormonal imbalance.I am not so sure. I have watched crows. And I can tell you that if I were forced to have sex with them I would much prefer it if they were dead.They would make that awful cawing noise if they were alive, and probably try to peck at your bits.Crows, I think, feel the same way.JUST a short word of congratulations to Jeremy Corbyn’s favourite country, Venezuela.The socialist paradise will soon experience an inflation rate of ONE MILLION PER CENT. That’s a pretty astonishing achievement.Most addled old Marxist dictators manage to keep inflation down to the low thousands.Meanwhile, Venezuela’s people are starving and every so often murdered or arrested by the foul Corbynista government.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And he insisted: “Mr Coveney is risking Ireland’s prosperity with his stubbornness.“The EU and Ireland are saying that unless Northern Ireland remains in the single market and customs union there would have to be a hard border – but they are also saying they would not impose one. It’s a fundamental contradiction.”Earlier Mr Coveney also suggested Britain could ask for Article 50 to be extended “beyond the deadline”. And he said it may be “necessary” to get an agreement.He also cast doubts on the Chequers deal - which seeks to bind the UK to EU rules on goods but not services.Mr Coveney also said it may be necessary for Britain to get a deal to ask for Article 50 to be extendedHOW dare gobby Irish politicians keep belittling Britain?

Prime Minister Imran Khan, although his party has officially held off on declaring victory.Mr Khan himself has denied allegations that he is getting help from the military which has ruled Pakistan for almost half of its history.The army has also denied allegations of meddling in the election.Imran Khan is a cricket star-turned politician who is a leading contender in Pakistans election.Described as a quiet and shy boy in his youth Mr Khan attended the Royal Grammar School, Worcester, before completing his formal schooling with an undergraduate degree in economics from Keble College, Oxford.He was Pakistans cricket captain when the national squad won the World Cup in 1992.But after marrying Jemima in 1995, he moved into politics, founding his Tehreek-e-Insaf, the Movement for Justice party.The pairs romance generated shockwaves as he was a strict Muslim, and she was 20 years his junior.Jemima, daughter of the late Jewish financier Sir James Goldsmith, converted to Islam when she married Mr Khan, who was dubbed crickets greatest playboy in the 1980s and 1990s and was a favourite with women.The couple divorced in 2004.Mr Khans passion for politics was spurred by his renewed commitment to Islam.A profile on his party website says: As a politician, his vision is to turn Pakistan into a just society, based on humane values.[He aims to create] an independent and honest judiciary that will uphold democracy, protect human rights and ensure the rule of law.Mr Khan also hopes to provide equal opportunity for upward social mobility to the working classes.This election will mark the second transfer of power from one civilian to another in Pakistans 71-year history.The country was been under military rule on and off for a total of 33 years.Since obtaining independence in 1947, all of 29 of Pakistans Prime Ministers failed to complete a full term, with four only lasting for one day.They were booted out of office for a variety of reasons including military coups and assassination.Election campaigns were plagued for months by allegations the powerful armed forces have been trying to tilt the race in Khans favour.Military officials had fallen out with the outgoing ruling party of Shehbaz Sharif, who was jailed on corruption charges this month.Pakistans military have been accused of interefering in the election results.Around 371,000 soldiers were stationed at polling stations across the country on Wednseday, nearly five times the number deployed at the last election in 2013.Mr Khans rivals Benazir Bhutto who leads the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Sharif who leads the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, have reported of election rigging.The PML-N and the PPP both said they recieved hand-written tallies of election counts that officials could not verify, as monitors in many voting centres had not received the official notifications.PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said:  This whole election could be null and void, and we dont want this.Mr Shehbaz told a conference on election day: It is a sheer rigging. The way the peoples mandate has blatantly been insulted, it is intolerable."},{"url":null,"title":"ambulance parking ticket firm suspended","story":"The jobsworth warden sparked outrage after issuing the ticket while paramedics ran into a Tesco to grab a bottle of water on their first break in eight hours.The firm which owns the car park outside the Tesco - London and Cambridge Properties (LCP) - employs Euro Parking Services to manage the land for them.But LCP have now suspended patrols and enforcement in the car park - saying they were very disappointed members of the emergency services had an issue with a parking officer.Euro Parking Services have also issued an apology and said the ticket should never have been issued in the first place.They say they have also personally apologised to them and will be making a donation to their charity as a gesture of goodwill.The ambulance was parked on double yellow lines outside the Tesco Express store on Tuesday when the row started.Astonishing footage showed the warden issuing the ticket as bystanders protest his decision.One can be heard saying: So you are giving a ticket to an ambulance that is on call... they were on call, if their radio goes they have to go.However the parking attendant, wearing an LA baseball cap, says: They are getting some food, so they are not on call are they?The parking worker then asks: Where are the sirens? Where are the sirens?A medic, who was several hours into her shift, then asks the man where he would like her to park the vehicle.He says the bay, however she explains that the ambulance does not fit in the bay.She says: Im not being funny, Im not going to use a disabled space... so where would you like me to park?Ive been on since 6.45am this morning, Ive had nothing to drink, nothing to eat.And now Id like to go to Tesco to get some water.According to the law - set out in the  Traffic Signs Regulations \u0026amp General Directions 2002 - emergency vehicles may park on double yellow, white, or red lines.Ambulance drivers are told they should always consider the safest place to park, however in the video the medic explains that her ambulance would not fit in the bay.The law advises that drivers try and leave the area as soon as possible, however the parking attendant would not even allow them to pop in for a bottle of water on one of the hottest days of the year.An ambulance may also exceed the speed limit if it safe to do so, however they are generally advised to go no quicker than 20mph above the speed limit of a road.They may also use bus lanes.But the parking attendant continues to give them a ticket.The video was uploaded onto Facebook after 10am on Tuesday by local man Ian French who was walking past at the time.Walking away, the medic says: If you ever need an ambulance... while Mr French, still filming, says to the warden, shame on you.A LCP spokesperson said: LCP supports all of our emergency services, and their staff and vehicles are regular visitors to our shopping centres and retail parades across the UK, where they are always welcome.On this occasion, we do not agree with the parking officer’s interpretation of the parking restrictions relating to emergency vehicles. A full review of the EPS contract will be undertaken at this site.In the meantime all enforcement and patrols at Kingsmead Square have been stopped and EPS will not be visiting site again pending completion of the review.Adrian Nesbitt, HR manager for the firm, added: “It is a mistake on our part, we will contact the ambulance service to offer our apologies and put together a full training package to make sure it doesn’t happen again.“The ambulance service is very important to our community, we don’t want to hinder them and we’re very saddened by the situation.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000422927535.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"960\" width=\"960","title":"jilted creep who sent nude pics of muslim ex to her family and claimed he owned her now is caged","story":"Hudhaifa Hayyawi, 21, forwarded intimate photographs of the woman to her brother after he had earlier tricked her into sending the pictures to him when they met through an online dating site.He accompanied the pictures with messages warning: Come to the UK - I own you now.The unnamed victim was so embarrassed at the disclosures she looked on the internet to find ways of committing suicide. She and her brother later flew more than 4,000 miles to the UK to report Hayyawi to police.Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester heard the revenge porn attack occurred after the pair met online while Hayyawi was living in Ashton-under-Lyne having emigrated from his native Iraq.Miss Laura Nash prosecuting said: They used an app which allowed them to talk online in their own languages and they moved to communicating by Facebook messenger. The complainant said they were in a relationship and she spent time with his family and was fully welcomed in as his girlfriend.But during this time, he asked her for photographs both fully clothed and naked - he told her that because he claimed she should trust him. She then sent him photographs and videos, including what can only be described as full-frontal nudity.He said he had deleted them but he had not. There were issues during the relationship and he threatened to circulate the content and messages to her contacts.She was unsure if he was really able to do this or how he would have access to her contacts. This would have been very embarrassing for her and her family who have a very large standing in the community.She considered taking her own life due to the stress of the incident. Mr Hayyawi sent the photographs to her brother over WhatsApp. The defendant then made her go to a hotel in Saudi Arabia whilst he did this.Messages said he demanded she should come to the UK as he owned her now. This was extremely distressing. Overriding shame and fear came from her statement and she and her brother flew to the UK to report the case.Hayyawi was questioned on June 14 but claimed he took medication which affected his memory.The court heard he blamed the incident on family pressure and pressure from her brother due to their families being Muslim and the pressures they faced with relationships.Hayyawi admitted an offence of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress and was jailed for ten months. He was also ordered not to contact the victim under the terms of a restraining order.His lawyer Andrew Marsh said in mitigation: Mr Hayyawi takes medication from post traumatic stress disorder. He shows substantial remorse, and says how he was not thinking everything through due to his obsession with this lady.He took an extreme action and apologies for that. His intention was not to maximise stress, and says his actions resulted from his condition. He did not go into great thought of what he was doing or the impact it would have on her. He understands it is a serious matter.He is 21 years old, and was a refugee as a child from Iraq.Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Michael Hayton QC told Hayyawi: You met a young lady online and pursued a relationship. This happens all the time and several times a day. That connected into a form of relationship and caused you to meet in this country.But that relationship began to break down and you struggled to come to terms with this - and in fact you still haven’t come to terms with this. Mr Hayyawi, you chose to deal with the breakup in a particular way. You have images and videos of her in a state of undress and sent them to her brother.I accept that you did not publish them online or publicly, but sending them to her brother had a severe impact on her. Full of shame, she felt she needed to fly all the way to England to complain against you.The impact psychologically caused her to look on the internet and search up terms on how to take her own life. You callously disregarded her and tried to stop her from having any other relationships without considering the consequences.I accept that you are a 21 year old man with good character and an early guilty plea which will be considered. But your reported behaviour was controlling and you had not fully understood the consequences.You thought you had a sense of entitlement, and the report says you pose as a risk against women. This is beyond the custodial threshold. You caused devastating impact in a calculated way to maximise her distress and that distress was extreme."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000422960386.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tycoon landlord demands 5k from homeowners to get onto their own drive after he bought road behind their homes","story":"Ian Jones, who drives a Rolls Royce, bought a road behind a row of cottages in Penrhynside, North Wales, last April.He sent letters to the 14 homeowners asking if they could each pay £350 so he could renovate the track.Mr Jones wanted to widen the road and cut back the hedges and trees and told the residents they could use it if they coughed up the cash.But he claims he did not receive a reply from any of the residents and has now installed a gate at the bottom, the Daily Post reports.Residents are furious and have said they can’t park their vehicles behind their homes.One homeowner told the paper: This is a very upsetting situation for all of us.

livestock","story":"Freezers and fridges have failed at supermarkets all over the country, as the UK swelters in record breaking heat.The first half of summer is already the driest on record with record temperatures today sent tumbling as the mercury soared to 35C.But while Brits have rushed to parks and beaches to make the most of the heat, the high temperatures have triggered a nightmare combination of conditions for farmers.Following the driest first half of summer on record, farming leaders warned crops are being hit and livestock are having to be fed with feed that should be held for winter as grasslands are parched.Ian Wright, director general of the Food and Drink Federation, told BBC Radio: We’re going through the most extraordinary summer and we’re already seeing farmers struggling with crops, with feed for ruminants [cattle and sheep].There are vegetable shortages because there hasn’t been enough rain.Already, carrot growers have warned shoppers could see a shortage at the supermarket due to the hot and dry conditions.The Chairman of the British Carrot Growers Association Roger Hobson told The Grocerthat it is inevitable that shoppers will see a price hike later this year thanks to the warm weather.Shoppers could also see a shortage in onions due to the weather. And it could get even hotter, with a sizzling 37C forecast for Friday - creeping closest to the UKs all-time heat record of 38.5C.Todays hot conditions saw Europe the hottest country in Europe.But a short relief is in sight, with the Met Office predicting torrential downpours, accompanied by hail and strong gusts on Friday afternoon and into the evening.The yellow weather warning will cover the south east of England, as well as northern and eastern parts of the country.The hot weather has also sparked warnings for a high air pollution alert to be issued for London.Mayor Sadiq Khan said: This is the second time in six months that we have had to use the high alert system and shows just why air pollution is a public health crisis.Children, the elderly and people with lung or heart problems have been advised to reduce strenuous exercise and physical exertion.Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been urged to set out what measures he is taking to make sure the NHS can cope with the heatwave.Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said hospitals are facing year-round pressures, saying the traditional lull in NHS activity during the quieter summer months is a thing of the past.Blood supplies have dropped, health officials have said, saying some people have been too dehydrated to donate while others have chosen to stay in the sun.MPs have warned heat-related deaths will treble by mid-century unless the Government takes action to tackle the dangers of soaring summer temperatures."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000000833387.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"man allergic sun","story":"Though he was initially sent home from hospital with a supposed infection, shockingly it later transpired that he was allergic to the sun.This rare condition is known as Xeroderma Pigmentosum and only 100 people in the UK have been diagnosed with it. It causes skin to blister and burn if it is exposed to the slightest amount of UV light.Understandably getting on with daily routines had been a real struggle for Alex, 25.Every inch of his skin had to be covered to stop it from burning. To protect his face his mum, Anna, designed and made a thick visor from plastic that hung from a hat and covered his face – but it was incredibly hot and distorted his vision.As part of a new TV experiment airing tonight, Inventing the Impossible: The Big Life, three people with various medical conditions hope to have their world transformed by a group of inventors. Alex, who also has neurological complications which have led to hearing loss and learning difficulties says: I wish I could be like everyone else but I cant help not being that.Design engineer Zoe Laughlin was challenged with to come up with a better solution to Alexs large and clunky homemade visor.But because Alex is 10,000 times more sensitive to UV damage than a normal person - so much so that even on gloomy days, he can’t go out unprotected - the requirements were extensive.He has to check the lights in every room with a special UV protection device wherever he goes.Anna says: “While a normal person’s DNA repairs at a rate of 98 per cent, his repairs at just 3 per cent. So if I was to get cancer at 60, he’d be likely to get it at three.“The doctors told us we’d have to live by night and sleep by day. So for the first few years we lived with the curtains closed.“I’d sit inside every day and cry with him. And the rest of the world went on outside.“But doctors said he might die at three and I wanted to show him as much of the world as I could. I wasn’t prepared to lock him away.Using a UV testing meter and a UV light, the engineers set to work to test different materials to see what might work as a base material for a mask to protect Alexs skin.Glass, snorkel masks and plastic all proved too weak and let UV rays through - which would cause Alex to burn.It turns out that Zoes moment of inspiration occurred while on a spa break.After trying a peel-off mask, the lead engineer tracked down a prosthetics company to see if they could make a UV protecting mask - like that used in Ninteties hit film Mrs Doubtfire.The idea was that it would be a second skin, which Alex could put on whenever he wants to leave the house.The mask was made by taking a scan of the persons face using a flashing light camera that takes thousands and thousands of pictures per seconds. The code of these photos is then sent to a computer and a 3D mask is created in the right proportions for the customers face.She finds a special kind of silicone that has 100 per cent UV protection.Dubious at first, Alex agrees to let Zoe and the other engineers go ahead and make the mask for him and undergoes a 3D body scan. It creates a lifelike 3D model of him which is then printed and cast back in the workshop.Using a bed of polymer powder, they print an exact model of Alex that will form the basis of the mask. A mould is then filled with the silicone.The mask took more than 300 painstaking hours to create - but once it is ready, Zoe takes the finished piece - complete with artificial stubble and hair - to Alex.Clearly unsure and shocked, the 25-year-old agrees to try it on, admitting hes blown away by the similarity between his face and the masks.Anna says: Im so glad they tried something that hasnt been done before. I just didnt think that you could do it. Theres a lot of work gone into it.Trying it on, Alex is speechless.Its so much more comfortable, he finally says, walking round in the mask of his own face.Without hesitating, Alex takes his first steps outside in his new mask.His mum, clearly emotional, say: Ive never seen Alex like this in my life.Alex hasnt been out like this, in broad daylight, at midday, ever, Anna says. Its a whole new world of potential."},{"url":null,"title":"lyudmila rudenko google doodle 114th birthday","story":"Google is commemorating the Grandmaster on what would have been her 114th birthday with a stylish Doodle – here is her story.Lyudmila Rudenko was born in Lubny, Ukraine – then part of the Russian Empire – on  July 27 1904.Although she was more interested in swimming as a child, her dad taught her to play chess at the age of 10.She began playing the sport competitively at tournaments when she moved to Moscow in 1925, winning the capitals womens championship three years later.Rudenko married her scientist husband Lev Davidovich Goldstein after moving to Leningrad, and they had a son in 1931.It was there that she began training under master chess player Peter Romanovsky, and took the Leningrad womens championship on three occasions.During the second world war, Rudenko organised a train to evacuate children from the Siege of Leningrad, one of the conflicts most destructive and harrowing engagements.Despite all of her success in chess, it was this which Rudenko considered the crowning achievement of her life.In 1950, she became the second woman ever to win the Womans World Chess Championship, holding the title until 1953.Rudenko was named an International Master of chess in 1950, and a Woman Grandmaster in 1976, with her exploits paving the way for women to come.In 1998, the search engine founders Larry and Sergey drew a stick figure behind the second o of Google as a message to that they were out of office at the Burning Man festival and with that, Google Doodles were born.The company decided that they should decorate the logo to mark cultural moments and it soon became clear that users really enjoyed the change to the Google homepage.In that same year, a turkey was added to Thanksgiving and two pumpkins appeared as the os for Halloween the following year.Now, there is a full team of doodlers, illustrators, graphic designers, animators and classically trained artists who help create what you see on those days.Among the Doodles published in past months were designs commemorating German scientist Robert Koch, Jan Ingenhousz (who discovered photosynthesis) and the 50th anniversary of kids coding languages being introduced.And the search giant celebrated the 2017 Autumn Equinox , which marked the official ending of summer and the coming of autumn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister’s Chequers proposals suggested a situation where the UK would collect excise duties at the border on the EU’s behalf.  But after a day of negotiations with Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, Brussels chief negotiator Michel Barnier unceremoniously killed the idea.  At a press conference following the day’s negotiations, he said: “The EU cannot and will not delegate its customs policy and rules, VAT and excise duty collections to a non member who would not be subject to the EU’s governance structures. “Any customs arrangements or customs union - and I’ve always said the EU is open to a customs union - must respect this principle. “And in any case, a customs union, which would help to reduce friction at the border, would come with our common policy for goods.”  He added: “The UK wants to take back control of its money, law and borders, and we will respect that, But the EU also wants to keep control of its money, law and borders and the UK should respect that. Mr Barnier said that he wanted to bring new energy into these negotiations over the coming weeks ahead of the EU summit in October at which it is hoped to finalise the Withdrawal Agreement and reach a political declaration on a future relationship. He said that UK proposals on security marked a real step forward and welcomed the acknowledgement in Mrs May\u0027s White Paper that the European Court of Justice is the only arbiter of EU law. He said he was particularly pleased with progress on foreign policy and external security. But he said: In contrast, on our future economic relationship, it comes as no surprise that finding common ground between the EU27 and the UK is more difficult.  Mr Barnier said future market access for financial services would be governed by autonomous decisions on both sides. We recognise the need for this autonomy not only at the time of granting equivalence decisions but also at the time of withdrawing such decisions and we agreed to have close regulatory cooperation, he said. And he said the backstop on the Irish border must be resolved and raised concerns about the UK\u0027s position.

The Plymouth MP and ex-soldier is a member of the Health and Social Care Committee, who on Tuesday got their first opportunity to grill new Health Secretary Matt Hancock. But Mercer was absent from the crucial evidence session, the final meeting before Parliament broke up for Summer. His absence is understood to be down to his participation in the Channel 4\u0027s charity game show Celebrity Hunted, in which contestants have to evade capture from detectives as long as possible.

French European Affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau warned the UK would suffer more than the EU from no-deal.  But she said the “door remains open” for Britain to tear up Article 50 and remain in the Union.   Meanwhile, Waitrose boss and ex-International Trade minister Lord Price warned a no-deal Brexit would push up the cost of fruit and veg, meat and dairy products because they cannot be stockpiled.  Theresa May visited the Royal Welsh Agricultural show today, amid growing concern over the government\u0027s plan to stockpile food to cope with a no-deal Brexit.  Asked by the BBC if Britain could stay in the EU on the same terms if it changed its mind, Ms Loiseu said: Sure, of course. She added: Brexit is a decision which we regret but which we respect. It was a choice made by the British people. We have always said the door would remain open and that we were not the ones who wanted to divorce from the UK. It was the British people who had decided to leave the EU, not the EU. And she warned without a deal there would be a brutal divorce on the evening of March 29” with no transition period. She told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today: I do remember Prime Minister May saying that no-deal was better than a bad deal. It\u0027s among the bad solutions but I should say that no-deal is not as bad as a bad deal for the European Union as well. We would all suffer, the worst would be for the United Kingdom but we get prepared for a no-deal because until now we have seen no significant progress regarding the withdrawal agreement which would relieve us from this concern that there could be a no-deal (exit).”  Ms Loiseau told Today a no-deal Brexit would slow down trade relations between the UK and France, Belgium, the Netherlands and every entry point to the European Union. Asked what it would mean for the Port of Calais, she said: On the day of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union with no deal, we should start with new tariffs (and) controls and that means of course traffic jams in Calais and in each and every European port welcoming goods and people coming from the United Kingdom. Tory peer and Waitrose boss Lord Price, who left the Government in September, told Today what while it is pretty straightforward to stockpile food stored in bottles, packets and tins, the same is not true for fresh produce. He said: The area that we are most vulnerable in is fruit and veg. We only produce in this country about 25% of the fruit and veg we consume - on fruit 30% comes from Europe, the rest comes from around the world, but on vegetables 80% comes from Europe and particularly Spain\u0027s salad crops.

Evie-Beth Taylor was just five when she flummoxed doctors with chickenpox so bad they initially told her parents it might be a rare genetic disease and not the childhood disease at all. The infection was so severe the little girl was left screaming in pain whenever she was touched making it impossible for mum Lianne Taylor, 33, to clean her airways. So poorly she couldn\u0027t eat, drink or even use the toilet, poor Evie-Beth\u0027s nose became so clogged with \u0027rock hard\u0027 mucus that the little girl struggled to breathe. Lianne called paramedics and her poorly daughter was rushed to A\u0026ampE twice in just two days.  But Lianne claims she was \u0027treated like an over the top parent\u0027 and turned away both times, claiming she was told that she had to wait 10 days for the antibiotics prescribed by her GP to work. Desperate, Lianne took her daughter back to the GP once more who immediately arranged for her to go straight to hospital - where doctors told Lianne she was lucky to have brought her in when she did. After four days in hospital Evie-Beth was finally allowed to return home but it took months for the spots to completely go and has been left with scarring across her face and body. But now a year on, Lianne and Evie-Beth are bravely sharing the shocking images of her ordeal to raise awareness of just how serious chickenpox can be and tell other parents to seek help if concerned. Lianne, from Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, said: It was really traumatic seeing Evie-Beth like this.  She was struggling to breathe because she was so blocked up with mucus that went really hard. We couldn\u0027t get near her to wash her down or clean it away because she was screaming in pain. The spots just kept coming and coming. Even when she was in hospital the doctors were coming in every day and she was coming out with more and more spots. The doctors said they had never seen chickenpox that bad. They had a photographer come in and take photos of her skin because they had never seen a case as bad as hers before. They didn\u0027t know why. Mum-of-two Lianne first noticed a spot on her daughter\u0027s arm on February 4 2017 and thought it could be chickenpox. When the infection broke out in spots all over her body on February 8, her worried mum and dad Stuart Taylor bathed her in a bath with oats and rubbed her with creams and camomile lotions to ease the itch. But their daughter only got worse.  Lianne started sleeping in the same bed as little Evie-Beth so she could wake her up every hour to give her a drink. She was devastated when Evie-Beth only got more and more lethargic and eventually had to be carried and held over the toilet because her spots were too painful for her to even sit. Her GP prescribed her with antibiotics - but when paramedics took Evie-Beth to A and E on Feb 10 they turned her away then and on Feb 11 and told Lianne to wait 10 days for them to take effect. It wasn\u0027t until her GP sent Evie-Beth straight to Darlington Memorial Hospital on February 13 that the little girl was finally admitted. Lianne, who studies history at Teesside University, said: It was absolutely awful. It was really bad. Being sent away from A and E made me feel like I was treated like an over the top parent. It made it feel like it was beyond me and I couldn\u0027t do this. This was beyond the help I could give her. She couldn\u0027t eat or drink, she just lay there. She was crying and moaning and every time she moved she screamed. I was having to sleep next to her every night and not having much sleep myself and having to set an alarm to wake myself up every hour to get some fluids in her throat and give her paracetamol every four hours. It was horrendous. It was a really tough time.

The three dresses were created by designer Kate Tabor and took her over three weeks to make, using 20 metres of wetsuit material and 12 litres of foam.  Tabor took inspiration from the structural designs of Alexander McQueen and renowned haute-couturier Iris Van Herpen in creating the lip-smacking gowns.  The Couture creations were commissioned to celebrate the launch of Costa Coffee’s new Whipped Milk, which gives iced coffee drinks like the Iced Flat White and Cold Brew a silky mouth-feel while topping them with an elegant meringue-like appearance.  Kate Tabor, designer said: “Each dress is bespoke from a flirty minidress to an edgy asymmetric design and a classic, full-length bridal number all were inspired by the texture of Whipped Milk and the way it is poured. “I’ve created innovative costumes for everyone from David Bowie to The Chemical Brothers, but I’ve never designed anything as challenging or unique as Costa Coffee’s Whipped Milk Couture.” Designer Kate, who has created awe-inspiring costumes for music videos for the likes of Katy Perry and Kylie Minogue, began the process by sketching designs, then experimenting with delicate foams ahead of crafting robust neoprene shells, which supported the overall structure of the dresses. The painstaking application process took three hours per gown. The Whipped Milk creations mark the reinvention of Costa Coffee’s Iced Flat White and Iced Cappuccino drinks this summer.  The addition of Whipped Milk, an aerated skimmed milk foam topping, also forms the finishing flourish on summer menu items such as refreshing Cold Brew and in Costa Coffee’s new range of Milk Whips. Gennaro Pelliccia, Costa Coffee\u0027s Master of Coffee, added: Whipped Milk is Costa Coffee’s must-have summer drink addition, inviting coffee-lovers to enjoy their favourite hot choices as refreshing chilled drinks, perfect for the scorching weather we’ve been enjoying. “Coffee fans don’t even have to wait for Whipped Milk to make it from the catwalk to the high street, it’s already whipping up a storm in store now!” The Iced Flat White is expertly handcrafted by Costa Coffee\u0027s skilled baristas using the purest extract of the coffee bean.  In the same way the traditional ‘hot Flat White’ that fans know and love is finished with texturised milk so too is the iced version using the chilled Whipped Milk to recreate the luxurious silky texture. Cappuccino drinkers can enjoy the Iced Cappuccino made with either a double or triple extraction of espresso and topped with the delicate chilled milk foam. For a twist on your favourite Costa Cold Brew, try the Cold Brew with Whipped Milk. The meringue-like Whipped Milk floats beautifully on top of the Cold Brew and is a great way to add milk to the drink without diluting the coffee flavour and adding visual and sensorial excitement to the coffee drinking experience.

Now James\u0027 devastated sister, Natalie Taylor, has shared a shocking photograph of him in a coma to show the reality of drugs.  In the post on Facebook , Natalie, 27, wrote: Please stay away from them, don\u0027t use, don\u0027t sell, just stay away.   This is what happened to my brother because of drugs, they are dangerous and as you can see he\u0027s on life support here this was not long before he passed away! The drugs made his organs fail, he had internal bleeding, he had to be resuscitated 3 times and then in the end have no blood pressure and no medicines were working for him. The drug he was given was ecstasy and doctors say it was mixed with something else but they don\u0027t know what as of yet! He was a very vulnerable adult and had a few problems and was given these drugs so think twice before you give or sell to people knowing the effects it can have on people and knowing that it cost us my brothers life at 19 years old!!

All the family are in complete devastation. None of his family and friends expected this to happen at all, not ever.

It is thought to be the first time the pair have locked lips in public since their wedding day in May.  The rare moment happened on stage as the Duchess of Sussex presented Harry\u0027s victorious team with the winning trophy at the Sentebale Polo Cup 2018.  She gave the team captain a kiss on each cheek before turning to her husband for a kiss on the lips. Social media users thought it was an adorable moment, with one saying I love this couple and another commenting love is love very sweet. Meghan also later rubbed Harry\u0027s back as the couple left the polo field, holding hands.  Meghan looked a picture of elegance today as she made a surprise appearance at the fundraising polo match to cheer on Harry. The Duchess channelled 50s chic after opting for a navy Carolina Herrera dress with a flared skirt - thought to cost around \u0026pound2,300 - teamed with a pair of \u0026pound550 nude heels. Her locks were tied in a loose bun and she chose a summery rattan clutch to complete the outfit. Meanwhile, Harry went for more casual attire in jeans, a white shirt and a grey blazer. The 36-year-old former Suits actress watched him score two goals from the royal box as the team ran out 5-4 winners. At one point during the game Harry sent the ball flying inches from a photographer when attempting to defend his goal - but he quickly apologised for the mishap.  The sporting fixture has become an important annual event raising funds and awareness for Harry\u0027s charity Sentebale. It\u0027s an organisation which works with children and teenagers in Lesotho and Botswana who are coming to terms with being HIV positive, have Aids or have lost their parents to the disease. The sweltering temperatures meant the match between Harry\u0027s Sentebale St Regis team, captained by Sentebale ambassador Nacho Figueras, and the Royal Salute players, led by Malcolm Borwick, was shortened to protect the polo ponies and the breaks were lengthened.  Mr Figueras, who was invited to Harry\u0027s wedding with wife Delfina Blaquier, said about Meghan: She\u0027s lovely, she\u0027s wonderful, I\u0027m very happy for Harry. I think they\u0027re both lucky to have found each other, I\u0027m very excited about this new chapter in his life. Speaking about his brief chat with the duchess while on stage, he said: She said that she enjoyed the game. She watched the game with my wife, which is wonderful because they were able to talk about polo and she could learn more about the game.

So we would have imagined that having members of the royal family rocking up to the school gates all the time would get tongues waggling. But apparently that\u0027s not the case and parents barely give the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge a second glance when they drop Prince George off at school. Despite having nannies and a host of other staff to help them out, the proud parents are regulars on the school run. But one parent told the Daily Mail there\u0027s actually another mum who people find a lot more interesting than Kate and Wills - especially the dads.  They said: No one really gives Kate a second glance when she does the school drop-off. We have a Victoria\u0027s Secret model doing the school run, too, and the dads are far more interested in her!

It comes after today was confirmed as the hottest day of the year so far with temperatures reaching 33.9C in Surrey. Thunderstorms had been forecast for Friday but the Met Office have now issued a yellow warning from 2pm this afternoon until 9pm tonight. Areas included in the warning include East Midlands, London and the South East, the North East, the North West, Yorkshire \u0026amp Humber and the East of England. The Met Office warned that there is a small chance homes and businesses could be flooded quickly as well as damage from lightning strikes, hail or strong winds.  There is a slight chance of power cuts in some areas. The extreme weather could also affect public transport with the possibility of delays to train and bus services. Spray and sudden flooding could also lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures. A similar warning has been issued for tomorrow between 2pm and 11.45pm. The Met Office said: With hot air over the UK some scattered thunderstorms may form over parts of central and eastern England on Thursday afternoon.  Where these do form there is the potential for some very heavy rain for a short period of time as well as frequent lightning and perhaps hail and some gusty winds. Despite the yellow warning, forecasters have warned tomorrow could be even hotter than today and it could shape up to be the hottest July day on record. Highs of up to 37C are forecast in southern, eastern and central England, but a Met Office spokesman said if conditions ‘all come together’, the record of 38.5C, set in August 2003, could even be broken. The scorching heatwave is set to continue into August - after weeks of sky-high temperatures. During the current heatwave, UK temperatures have been approximately 10C higher than average for this time of year.

Social media have heaped praise on the five-year-old girl - calling her stunning and a living doll after a professional photographer shared her portrait. Last Friday, photographer Mofe Bamuyiwa posted three photos of the young girl named Jare, saying: “Oh yes she’s human! She’s also an angel! and children are a gift from heaven. The little girl shows no hint of shyness in the distinctive portraits where she looks straight into the camera and shows off her skillful poses.  Fans gushed over the images on Instagram commenting simply gorgeous, soo beautiful and absolutely stunning. Mofe reportedly works as a lifestyle and wedding photographer in Lagos, Nigeria. Despite Jare\u0027s obvious confidence Mofe told Yahoo Lifestyle: “Jare isn’t a professional model.  She has two sisters - Jomi, 7, and Joba, 10 - who also model and have their own instagram page. Although not everyone was a fan. Some people couldn\u0027t believe the images were real and asked if photoshop was used or the girl was given a wig. Jare isn\u0027t the first girl to take Instagram by storm at such a young age. French supermodel and actress Thylane Blondeau, 17, first made a name for herself at just four years old modelling for Jean Paul Gaultier.   Two years later, aged six, she graced the page of fashion-bible vogue and her blond her and blue eyes made her a global superstar.  The photo earned her the original title of the \u0027most beautiful girl in the world\u0027 and she is now a regular on runways across the world. Meanwhile, six-year-old Anna Knyazeva, from Russia, has attracted over 1.2 million fans on Instagram thanks to her model-looks.

It is the crowning political achievement for a man who made his name not as a statesman but as a sporting hero. Since finishing his sporting career as one of the world\u0027s most famous cricketers, he has become an outspoken campaigner against political corruption. And on Thursday he declared victory in Pakistan\u0027s general elections - just 22 years after founding his political party. Here\u0027s everything you need to know about his journey from cricket star to world leader.  Imran Khan\u0027s cricket career  Khan was born in October 1952 in Lahore, Pakistan . He started his schooling at the private Aitchison school in Lohore, and later attended the Royal Grammar School, Worcester.  He completed an undergraduate degree in economics at Keble College, Oxford. He first started playing cricket for his college at the age of 13, and would later play for Worcestershire. He made his debut for Pakistan in 1971 at the age of 18, and by 1982 had become the national team\u0027s captain. Khan is commonly regarded as one of the greatest ever fast bowlers. In a glittering career he played 88 Test matches and scored 3807. He retired from cricket after winning the World Cup in 1992 as one of Pakistan’s all-time most successful players.  How did Imran Khan become Pakistan\u0027s Prime Minister? After his retirement from cricket, Khan became more focused on politics. In 1996 he founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), a centrist party opposed to the centre-left Pakistan People\u0027s Party (PPP) and conservative Pakistan Muslim League (PML). Khan went on hunger strike in 2007 as a protest against emergency rule in Pakistan. It came a week after he was jailed as part of a crackdown on political opponents by then-president Pervez Musharraf. PTI grew rapidly over the two decades, and is now one of the major political forces in Pakistan. In the 2013 elections it overtook the PPP to become the official opposition party in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh.  In the 2018 election Khan\u0027s party went up against the ruling PML, whose former leader Nawaz Sharif was removed from office as Prime Minister over corruption charges in 2017 and later jailed. The election campaign has been marred by violence, delays in ballot counting and claims of vote rigging. A suicide bombing killed 31 people near a polling station in Quetta, capital of the Baluchistan province. Khan declared victory in the election on 26 July 2018, but looked unlikely to hit the majority of seats needed to form a solo government, meaning he would have to look to form a coalition.  Who is Imran Khan\u0027s wife? In the 1970s and 80s, Khan had an image as a playboy. He was often seen partying at London nightclubs, and was linked to a series of socialites and minor aristocrats. His first marriage, in May 1995, was to journalist and documentary producer Jemima Goldsmith - daughter of finance tycoon Sir James Goldsmith. Jemima converted to Islam before their wedding, and they married in a short ceremony in Paris. They had two sons together, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim. The pair divorced in June 2004, with Khan saying: my political life made it difficult for her to adapt to life in Pakistan.  His second marriage came in January 2015 to British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan, but the pair announced their divorce just nine months later. Khan\u0027s political party confirmed in February 2018 that he had married for the third time, this time to his spiritual advisor Bushra Manika.

Definitely not.“I think this was to do with the changes we had to make and because we didn’t keep the ball in the front and be more simple.“Nicky Clark was tired and James Keatings has just come back from an injury so he got tired. After that our attacking game was not there.“But I want a team who is ready for Dunfermline, that is ready for the league. We have the two weeks and we go now for the next level.”And Csaba was quick to point out United have not been the only team to have problems in these early season fixtures.“I have watched the results and every big team is struggling. You are not there where you want to be at the moment. This is not an excuse but it is true. If you train every week two times daily you see that legs are tired. Still, with these tired legs you have to win the game one zero, or two zero and finish.”United now head for Elgin City on Saturday knowing they have no chance of qualifying.It will, however, be another vital game as the manager tries to knock his new-look side into shape in their last outing before the league business starts.United’s ‘Meet the fans day’ takes place at Tannadice on Sunday when supporters will get the chance to see the team train.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f13f2179a.jpg ","title":"dundee people all aboard thehms unicornfor family fun","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSwashbuckling pirates stormed the HMS Unicorn as people of all ages turned out for the vessel’s summer family fun day.Youngsters dressed up and got the chance to meet unofficial mascot Pirate Bob.Children also had their faces painted and took part in sand art activities.There was even a special curator’s tour of the Music of Maritime Life.Billy Rough, education officer at the Unicorn, said: “It was such a fantastic day.“It was incredibly busy despite it being a glorious sunny day.

The first is my collections of jewellery which I design and make to be distributed to the shops that stock my designs up and down the country.“The second is my bespoke pieces.“This is where someone comes in with a design in mind or with a piece they want to be remodelled.“With my bespoke designs it is much more fun as I can be a bit more creative.“It can be a big responsibility as a lot of the time someone is grieving over the loss of a loved one and they want a piece to remember them by or they want a piece of their loved one’s jewellery reworked.“You can’t change it back, so it can be quite nerve-racking.“I have also incorporated people ashes into designs, so it can be a very emotional journey with my customer.“It is lovely that I can really help customers after the passing of a loved one with a piece that is incredibly sentimental.“The third part is teaching.“I have held workshops since the beginning.

It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me.

stakeholders based on a range of economic, environmental and technical considerations.\u0026nbsp\"As a responsible developer, we have listened carefully to the feedback during consultation, and to minimise the visual impact of the extension, we are proposing a gas-insulated switchgear solution, which significantly reduces the footprint of the site.\"We have also purchased additional land to

according to a trade union.The GMB represents most of the hospital\u0027 security staff.It has calculated the sum on the number of hours that high-ranking, highly paid NHS officials have dedicated to the discussions.There have been nine meetings to date.Three more are scheduled to follow.The board has hit back, insisting that \"organisational change is managed within existing resources\".Such a reason is regularly given by public bodies when questioned about the use of staff time that is clearly beyond their regular, scheduled\u0026nbsp duties.The union has complained that morale among security staff is low while general staff safety has become an increasing concern at the north of Scotland\u0027 largest hospital.It is furious that the lengthy review of staff cover within the security department was apparently prompted \"because an ex manager has the view that the guards don\u0026rsquot have enough work to do\".The GMB\u0027 regional officer Liz Gordon calculates that the process has so far cost taxpayers \u0026pound7808.34.It prompted her to ask: \"How many operations would that pay for?\"Ms Gordon said: \"The security staff cover a 32-acre site and have an increasingly challenging job.\"The statistics show that aggression and the threat of violence is escalating not diminishing.\"It\u0027 suspected that the board want to save money by getting security guards to undertake more of the work done by the porters, and vice versa.\"Equally, nursing is going to be expected to call upon the security guards less frequently and, therefore, do more themselves.\"She added: \"Police Scotland will be looked upon as a resource but their new triaging system will prevent this.\"Portering is literally run off its feet.\"It is covering an average of 22,000 steps per eight-hour shift \u0026ndash that\u0027 11 miles \u0026ndash and is often in crisis being reduced to single-man working.\"A spokeswoman for NHS Highland attempted to dismiss all the concerns.She said: \"Organisational change is managed within existing resources.\"Organisational change is ongoing in relation to security at Raigmore Hospital.\"The next meeting between management

complete the lengthy application process in time or find the \u0026pound559 required for a public entertainment licence. She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour to make their sandcastles, they would all get stickers and we would get someone local to judge the best ones.\"She had thought that parents would simply mind their own children, but Highland Council told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.As Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes had advertised the event on social media and circulated flyers around the town, she was worried she might have to call the whole thing off: \"I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page to ask people for advice.And as a result, Fochabers firm Saltaire Security offered their services for free and provided a copy of their own public liability insurance certificate to Highland Council.There were also offers to provide lifeguard cover and Nairn Business Improvement District also came forward to say it would help.In the end, Highland Council agreed to waive permission fees.\"It couldn\u0026rsquot have gone ahead without the security company and everyone else who is helping for free,\" said Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes, who has also been delighted at the offers of prizes from local businesses.Weather permitting, the event will now go ahead on Sunday with registration taking place from 10am at Nairn Links for categories ranging from pre-school through to teenagers and adults.A spokeswoman for Highland Council said a public entertainment licence was required for the use of either indoor or outdoor premises for certain types of events.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 8:36

Gemmell, geneticist and professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand, visited the Highlands with a team of specialist scientists to collect the water samples in June.The Super Natural History

The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 8:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116735.jpg","title":"Pamiloo to make its first visit to Black Isle Show","story":"\u0026nbspCAMPAIGNERS have welcomed news that accessible toilets will be installed at this year\u0027 Black Isle Show \u0026ndash allowing people with complex needs to enjoy the event.Fiona MacLeod-Chiarini, whose brother Ewan MacLeod is severely disabled, contacted the show\u0027 organisers to ask about the availability of a Pamiloo (right), a mobile facility for those with profound impairments.Rod Mackenzie, the Black Isle Show\u0027 company secretary, immediately got in touch with the charity Promoting a More Inclusive Scotland (Pamis), which owns the Pamiloo, in order to make the event accessible for the family.Mrs MacLeod-Chiarini hailed the move, and believes facilities such as the Pamiloo can be life-changing.She said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the Black Isle Show have taken our concerns on board and have booked the Pamiloo.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

John\u0026#8217s 72 was the best gross score on the day with Peter Mclean Jnr moving into third place when he recovered from a horror start to post a 76.The handicap trophy was another tight affair with Jimmy MacNab showing the youngsters how it is done with a superb net 64 taking a one shot lead over David Ronald and a two-shot lead over James Smyth.The John Reid Quaich which is played as part of the championship was won by Duncan Johnstone on 134, edging out Iain Macalister by one shot.Despite the weather conditions, the members gathered in good spirits for the final round of the championship, a day that everyone looks forward to and with all competitions very close an interesting days play lay ahead.In the leading group, play was a bit nervy with neither player at their best on the front nine with Iain reducing the deficit to one shot with eight holes left to play. John got one back at the 11th and then another two at the 12th before a birdie at the 14th pretty much saw him home and dry.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"graham love is leaving macpool","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 2:20 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowGraham Love is moving on from Lochgilphead\u0026#8217s MacPool at the end of July.MacPool will be looking to recruit a new pool manager after the summer.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rock from rest and be thankful be reused in new project","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:26 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA new innovative method to help mitigate against potential landslips is being rolled out in Glen Kinglas near the Rest and be Thankful.The ongoing £1.84 million catch-pit works at the Rest and be Thankful involve digging and constructing three large ‘pits’ at the bottom of the slope that are designed to collect materials and run-off from a potential slip. The project has produced around 18,000 tonnes of usable rock, which has been stored temporarily, and designs have now been completed to reuse this material as additional protection for the A83.The material will be used in the construction of landslip mitigation bunds above streams along Glen Kinglas, some three to four miles from the Rest and Be Thankful. These bunds will form a constructed embankment of material initially across six individual water channels next to the roadside that geotechnical engineers have assessed to have the potential to deposit debris onto the trunk road should a landslip occur. The bunds will reduce the risk of debris reaching the roadside.The bunds will be up to 10 metres high in some sections and have the combined capacity to contain over 1,000 tonnes of debris should a landslip occur.Teams from BEAR Scotland have been working closely with the landowner and specialist sub-contractor to develop this sustainable approach to protecting the A83 for the long-term benefit of users of this important route.This sustainable method allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of the material being excavated from the Rest and be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works to the public purse via these projects which are being funded by Transport Scotland and the Scottish Government.As the works are focussed initially within six watercourse channels there will be short lengths of traffic management for approximately two to four weeks in each location. The A83 will remain open but it will be necessary for temporary traffic signals to be in place for the safety of road workers and road users.  The project will move in phases along this stretch of the A83 as the works progress.Real time journey information is available from Traffic Scotland on their website: trafficscotland.org\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 26/07/18, 9:24 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good. This has given me a huge boost.’Thanks to her winning photograph, Teenie has won an autumn break for two on Islay, featuring an overnight stay at the Machrie Hotel, dinner and B\u0026ampB in Bowmore’s Harbour Inn, a tour of Islay’s newest distillery, Ardnahoe, a boat trip with Islay Sea Adventures, travel via Hebridean Airways, based at Oban Airport, a night at the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel, and an Oban walking tour.Teenie said: ‘I am taking my sister, because she persuaded me to enter the competition.’Teenie also runs the island’s photography club and has just been awarded £1,000 to set up a junior one this winter.The runner-up was Alan Frew from Helensburgh. He was surprised but absolutely delighted with his achievement.His stunning picture was taken at Carsaig jetty, near Tayvallich.He said: ‘My son Aidan is an avid BMXer and wanted a picture of himself jumping.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

Thirty of the 32 Scottish local authorities have at least one Citizens Advice Scotland centre. But South Ayrshire is believed never to have had the help and rights championing service. Inverclyde is the only other area which does not have a CAB. Now a summit has been staged within Ayr County Buildings to state a case for having the service here. The steering group of councillors met on July 12 and one source said: “There is a definite anomaly here and the question should be asked why there is not a citizens advice bureau here. “I believe need has never been greater, with increasing consumer debt and other problems.” Councils have a duty to provide the advice, but South Ayrshire Council use their own staff to give it. They work out of the Wallace Tower in Ayr, but critics insist that because they are not independent, the advice cannot be of supreme impartiality. The source added: “Often people are coming in to say they cannot pay council tax or rent. “So far from being not involved, the Council is in fact the creditor. “A push is on to finally set up a proper service for the people of South Ayrshire. “There are a lot of odd things about the South Ayrshire model, not least who is informing it on a national basis. “It is a mystery why South Ayrshire Council should or can be operating an advice centre. “They are conflating advice with information.” Citizens Advice Scotland is a registered charity, helping 300,000 people a year from a total of 61 centres. It is often a place of last resort for people having difficulties in their lives, including being weighed down by debt. And the organisation also lobbies for change in government policy where it has identified hardship being caused. All local Citizens Advice Bureaux are managed by an independent board of directors and all bureaux are members of Citizen’s Advice Scotland.  A South Ayrshire Council spokesman said: “We are committed to supporting our communities  and our people, particularly those in need.  “Through our Information and Advice Hub we already provide services which deal with income maximisation, debt and money advice and consumer information.” The umbrella body Citizens Advice Scotland refused to comment.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyrAyr NewsTaxes"},{"url":null,"title":"amythyst-set-to-sparkle-in-selkirk","story":"IN case you missed Amythyst Kiah\u0027s previous two headline slots at the String Jam Club, you have the opportunity to make it third time lucky.\nDescribing herself as a Southern Gothic, alt-country blues singer/songwriter, Amythyst is one of the most incredible singers the musically-savvy County Hotel audience has ever heard.\nBased in Tennessee, her commanding stage presence is only matched by her raw and powerful vocals -

online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

Thumbelina, Mrs May met farmers to discuss Brexit.\nAddressing the meeting, she said: \u0026ldquoIt seems to me that what we have when we come out of the Common Agricultural Policy is an opportunity to determine what is going to be right for the United Kingdom, rather than being part of policy developed for a number of countries within the EU.\n\u0026ldquoSo that gives us a real opportunity, I think, for the future and to be able to set this industry on a really bright prospect for the future.\n\u0026ldquoTalking to some of the young farmers, there\u0026rsquos a huge enthusiasm for farming here in Wales and for looking to see what the opportunities for the future are.\n\u0026ldquoOne of the things is that we have this proposal which enables frictionless borders.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove been hearing some of the producers here talk about the importance of that just-in-time system, in order to export lamb and other products, across the borders, and to make that as frictionless as possible.\nThe Royal Welsh Agricultural Show is held in LLanelwedd, Powys (Christopher Furlong/PA)\n\u0026ldquoWe recognise the importance of the industry you represent, the planning for the future, the opportunities for the future.\n\u0026ldquoOne final word \u0026ndash sometimes we forget the extent to which farmers protect and look after the environment, and that\u0026rsquos an important issue.\n\u0026ldquoLeaving the EU presents us with a unique opportunity to transform our food, farming and environmental policies so we can have a healthy and prosperous agricultural industry that is fit for the future, and helps us to leave the environment in a better place than we found it.\n\u0026ldquoScrapping the Common Agricultural Policy, and introducing a simpler system which provides funds in return for public goods, like improving water quality, reducing emissions and planting wild flower meadows to boost biodiversity, is fundamental to our new approach.\n\u0026ldquoI want to make the most of the freedoms provided by Brexit to design a new scheme that is less bureaucratic, and does away with the overly prescriptive information farmers currently have to provide to apply for grants.\nEarlier, she met one of the nation\u0026rsquos young farming prospects, six-year-old Anest Jones, who was at the show with her mother, Yvonne, a

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

He told the Courier how the drastic change in career came about: \u0026ldquoWhen I was a PT people used to come to me and ask for a diet plan or a training plan.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod say \u0026lsquohave you had one of these before?\u0026rsquo and they\u0026rsquod tell me they\u0026rsquod had seven or eight.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.

Talking to farmers, land owners and estate managers she said the UK\u0026rsquos withdrawal from the EU\u0026rsquos Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is a chance to develop policy \u0026ldquoright for the United Kingdom.  The showcase, which attracts 250,000 visitors a year with 7,000 livestock on show, is held annually in Llanelwedd, Powys.  During her pre-meeting tour on Thursday, she was invited to hang the Best in Harness rosette on shire horse Mr Tumble, shown by Barrie Yeates, remarking that the seven-year-old giant looked \u0026ldquotoo big to tumble.  The Prime Minister leaned in close, patting the horse\u0026rsquos neck, and said: \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquore a winner. You are a winner.  After being shown sheep-shearing, a prize bull, and a foal named Fairywood Thumbelina, Mrs May met farmers to discuss Brexit.  Addressing the meeting, she said: \u0026ldquoIt seems to me that what we have when we come out of the Common Agricultural Policy is an opportunity to determine what is going to be right for the United Kingdom, rather than being part of policy developed for a number of countries within the EU.  \u0026ldquoSo that gives us a real opportunity, I think, for the future and to be able to set this industry on a really bright prospect for the future.  \u0026ldquoTalking to some of the young farmers, there\u0026rsquos a huge enthusiasm for farming here in Wales and for looking to see what the opportunities for the future are.  \u0026ldquoOne of the things is that we have this proposal which enables frictionless borders.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove been hearing some of the producers here talk about the importance of that just-in-time system, in order to export lamb and other products, across the borders, and to make that as frictionless as possible.  \u0026ldquoWe recognise the importance of the industry you represent, the planning for the future, the opportunities for the future.  \u0026ldquoOne final word \u0026ndash sometimes we forget the extent to which farmers protect and look after the environment, and that\u0026rsquos an important issue.  \u0026ldquoLeaving the EU presents us with a unique opportunity to transform our food, farming and environmental policies so we can have a healthy and prosperous agricultural industry that is fit for the future, and helps us to leave the environment in a better place than we found it.  \u0026ldquoScrapping the Common Agricultural Policy, and introducing a simpler system which provides funds in return for public goods, like improving water quality, reducing emissions and planting wild flower meadows to boost biodiversity, is fundamental to our new approach.  \u0026ldquoI want to make the most of the freedoms provided by Brexit to design a new scheme that is less bureaucratic, and does away with the overly prescriptive information farmers currently have to provide to apply for grants.

For those who can\u0026rsquot make it to an event, there will be a webinar available where you can learn more about what a deposit return scheme could mean for Scotland.  Under a deposit return scheme, customers pay a small deposit when they buy drinks in, for example, a bottle or a can, and then get the deposit back when they return the empty container for recycling. A public consultation on a deposit return scheme for Scotland was officially opened by the Scottish Government last month (Wednesday 27 June, 2018).  Cabinet Secretary for the Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform, Roseanna Cunningham, said: \u0026ldquoA deposit return scheme will provide a new secure source of high quality material which will create opportunities to develop our recycling infrastructure in Scotland and create jobs. This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.  \u0026ldquoI would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland\u0026rsquos needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.  Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoPeople will make this scheme a success \u0026ndash for our environment and our economy. The Scottish Government and Zero Waste Scotland have committed to designing the best possible deposit return scheme for Scotland. We want it to work for everyone \u0026ndash and that\u0026rsquos why we\u0026rsquore calling on as many people as possible to have their say.  \u0026ldquoWith thanks to support from a wide range of partners we are delighted to be out and about this summer, on behalf of the Scottish Government, visiting a wide range of events and locations across the country \u0026ndash from border towns to Inverness \u0026ndash asking everyone for their views on how a deposit return scheme could work best for them.  Following a successful first event at Glasgow Fort in June, Zero Waste Scotland will be at some of the country\u0026rsquos top events and attractions this summer \u0026ndash including ButeFest, the European Open Water Swimming Championships (part of Glasgow 2018), Edinburgh Mela, and Aviemore Triathlon.  The current programme of public engagement events is as follows:\u0026nbsp  July 25: Deep Sea World, North Queensferry  July 27-29:\u0026nbspButeFest, Isle of Bute  August 1: Scottish Seabird Centre, North Berwick  August 11:\u0026nbspEuropean Open Water Swimming Championships, Balloch  August 12: Aviemore Triathlon, Aviemore  August 22: St Enoch Centre, Glasgow  August 25: Peebles Market  August 31:\u0026nbspDundee Food and Flower Show  September 1 -2: Edinburgh Mela  September 5: Eastgate Shopping Centre, Inverness  September 14 - 16: Perth Food and Drink Festival  Members of the Zero Waste Scotland team will be at Deep Sea World on Wednesday, July 25\u0026nbspfrom 10am to 3pm to ask visitors and staff about choices such as the level of deposit which products should have a deposit on them where they should be able to take their empty drinks containers to get the deposit back and whether they\u0026rsquod welcome the option to donate the deposit in certain circumstances \u0026ndash for example to charities, schools or community groups.  Zero Waste Scotland staff will also be available to chat through four hypothetical examples of how Scotland\u0026rsquos deposit return scheme could work \u0026ndash which are based on 12 main factors to be considered when designing a deposit return scheme. These examples aim to help people understand how different factors of a deposit return scheme could vary to create different scheme designs with different outcomes for Scotland.  Full details on the main factors and examples are available to view as part of the public consultation on the Scottish Government website: https://consult.gov.scot/environment-forestry/deposit-return-scheme.  Fraser Edwards, Sales and Marketing Manager, Deep Sea World, said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to welcome Zero Waste Scotland to Deep Sea World to engage with our visitors and gather people\u0026rsquos opinions on a deposit return scheme for Scotland. From news coverage and documentaries to community action groups and social media, it is evident that we need to make a change to the materials which our goods are packaged in and how we dispose of them. At Deep Sea World, we aim to educate our visitors on the importance of protecting our oceans and reducing single-use plastics.  \u0026ldquoAs a business and as individuals, we know that it can be challenging when looking for alternatives to traditional plastic packaging. Measures such as a Scottish deposit return scheme however make it easier for all of us to take these positive steps for a cleaner, more sustainable future.  Zero Waste Scotland research shows over 64,000 tonnes of plastic food packaging and plastic bottles is thrown away into household general rubbish bins and sent to landfill every year in Scotland, costing the country a staggering \u0026pound11million each year. Meanwhile evidence shows countries with deposit return schemes operating overseas can reach over 90% recycling for targeted drinks containers, such as bottles and cans.

Cultural leaders have already warned of the affects that Brexit could have on the arts world, especially if the ability to move rapidly between Europe and the UK is undermined.  Last night Iain Munro, the new acting chief executive of Creative Scotland, the national arts funding organisation, said the body was concerned about the potential consequences of Brexit.  He said: \"Working internationally is key to ensuring that Scotland remains a successful and distinctive creative nation connected to the world.  \"We share the real concerns amongst the cultural community in Scotland as to the impact that leaving the EU will have on their work and the ability of artists to exchange ideas and practise.  \"We have discussed these matters with the Scottish Government and in UK Government forums, and a broader debate on this issue is therefore welcome.\"  The committee says that \"the ability to move between the UK and EU at short notice is integral to the business model of many cultural sector organisations, which are often built on the services of consultants and freelance workers working on a project basis, or working on multiple projects at one time.\"  Lord Jay of Ewelme, chairman of the Committee, said: \"Individuals working in the UK cultural sector are highly mobile, and have thrived on collaboration with people from all over the world.  \"The country benefits enormously from the sector\u0027s contribution to its economy and society, and it makes an important contribution to the UK\u0027s international image and influence.  \"If the Government is to achieve its wish to establish an immigration system that meets the needs of the post-Brexit economy, the UK\u0027s negotiators will need to be flexible.  \"This means recognising that any restrictions on EU citizens wishing to enter the UK to work may be matched by reciprocal restrictions on UK workers in the EU.\"  The report comes on the eve of the Edinburgh festival season, when many artists, writers, musicians, technicians and cultural workers arrive in the Scottish capital for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Edinburgh International Festival and the Edinburgh International Book Festival.  The Fringe and the Edinburgh International Festival are currently permit-free festivals, which means that performers do not need to obtain work permits to appear, or apply for entry to the UK under its points system.  However, many performers still need visas to attend, depending on which country they come from.  A spokeswoman for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe said: \"We are immensely proud of our permit free status and the open access platform that the Fringe provides for artists from across the globe.  \"However, the Fringe Society has no jurisdiction over the visa process and is not an immigration authority.  \"We will continue to work with the authorities in the UK to ensure that our international participants are informed about the immigration requirements and that the process is as smooth as possible.\"  In the report, the committee says that the UK Government consider two possible visa options \"that would recognise the two-way benefits that accrue from allowing artists, entertainers and other cultural sector workers to move freely between the UK and EU.\"  One of these is extending the \"permit free\" festival arrangements to all EU citizens.  The other is \"offering a multi-country, multi-entry short-term \u0027touring visa\u0027 for EU citizens, and seek a reciprocal commitment for UK citizens travelling to the EU.\"  The UK government\u0026rsquos recent White Paper acknowledges that \"the UK and the EU will \u0026hellip need provisions that allow for mobility\" to facilitate the proposed \"cooperative accord\" with the EU on culture and education."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-blamed-as-number-of-eu-teachers-applying-to-work-in-scotland-plummets","story":"  Figures show only 14 teachers from other EU countries and Switzerland applied for registration in Scotland in the first six months of this year.  This compares to 186 last year, 159 the year before and 128 in 2015.  Ken Muir, chief executive of the General Teaching Council of Scotland (GTCS), said applications were \u0026ldquofalling off a cliff and placed the blame firmly with Brexit.  He told Holyrood magazine: \"Having maintained numbers pretty high from the EU, they are falling off a cliff, and that\u0027s absolutely down to Brexit.  \"Particularly from three countries in the EU, Greece, Poland and Spain, we get a good number of applicants, followed by the Republic of Ireland it has to be said \u0026ndash those four are our big hitters, and those numbers have dwindled to next to nothing.\"  The overall number of applicants from outside Scotland has also plummeted, with only 126 in the first half of 2018 \u0026ndash compared to 598 last year and 614 the year before.  A spokeswoman for the EIS \u0026ndash Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest teaching union \u0026ndash insisted teachers from other countries \u0026ldquoare a valuable part of the Scottish education workforce, reflecting the society we live in.  She added: \u0026ldquoThis reported drop in applications can only exacerbate the ongoing teacher recruitment crisis.  Research by the Herald last summer showed there were more than 700 unfilled teacher vacancies before the start of term, with the shortfall blamed on a rise in numbers quitting the profession early and historic under-recruitment.  And earlier this year it emerged a teaching post in the north of Scotland had\u0026nbspbeen advertised six times by desperate council bosses \u0026ndash attracting just two applicants.  The latest figures came as teaching unions threatened to strike later this year amid an ongoing dispute over pay.  Scottish ministers said\u0026nbspthe dramatic drop in EU teachers demonstrated the urgent need for migration powers to be devolved, allowing Scotland to tailor policies to its needs.  Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: \u0026ldquoThese figures show the stark reality of Brexit. Already highly-skilled and hard-working EU citizens are thinking twice about choosing to live and teach in Scotland which will not only have a negative impact on the education workforce but our economy and society as a whole.  \u0026ldquoLast year we had citizens from almost every EU member country applying for GTCS registration but, so far this year, citizens from just six countries have applied to live and work in Scotland. And the head of the GTCS \u0026ndash the independent body that registers teachers \u0026ndash has today made plain that Brexit is driving this slump.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos education spokesman Iain Gray branded the figures \u0026ldquodeeply worrying.  He said teacher numbers had already plummeted under the SNP Government, and referenced a survey published last month which found a majority of teachers would not recommend the profession to others.  He added: \u0026ldquoA collapse in the number of applications from abroad as a result of the Tories\u0026rsquo shambolic handling of Brexit will only make this SNP teacher recruitment crisis worse.  Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens\u0026rsquo education spokesman, said teachers are \u0026ldquooverworked and under-resourced, adding: \u0026ldquoThis is yet another way in which Brexit, which Scotland overwhelmingly rejected, is already damaging our society.  A UK Government spokeswoman said: \"We deeply value the contribution of all EU citizens working in the UK\u0026rsquos education systems, they are vital to the future of our children and valued members of society.  \"After we leave the EU, we will have in place an immigration system which works in the best interests of the whole of the UK, including Scotland.  \"Freedom of movement will end and we be will creating an immigration system that delivers control over who comes to the UK, but that welcomes the brightest and best who want to work hard and contribute.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-public-should-be-reassured-and-comforted-by-government-stockpiling-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit","story":"  The Prime Minister\u0026rsquos remarks came after Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy premier, dismissed talk of a no-deal as \u0026ldquobravado and warned Britain that it \u0026ldquocould not afford to crash out of the European Union without an agreement.  In an interview with 5 News, Mrs May did not deny stockpiling was happening and insisted the Government was being \"responsible and sensible\" while still trying to get a good deal with Brussels.  Her comments came as Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, on a visit to Belfast, also insisted no-deal contingency planning was a \u0026ldquosensible and responsible thing for a government to do and large businesses that are importing or exporting large volumes of products or produce will be making contingency plans.  He added: \u0026ldquoAnd we would encourage them to do so and work closely with them as they are putting those plans together.\"  Earlier this week, Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary, told MPs he had asked officials to \"work up options for stockpiling\" by the pharmaceutical industry while his Cabinet colleague Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, said the Government would also take steps to ensure an \"adequate food supply\".  The PM said: \"Far from being worried about preparations that we are making, I would say that people should take reassurance and comfort from the fact that the Government is saying we are in a negotiation, we are working for a good deal - I believe we can get a good deal - but...because we don\u0027t know what the outcome is going to be... let\u0027s prepare for every eventuality.  \"This is not just about stockpiling. That concept, what it is, is about making sure that we will be able to continue to do the things that are necessary once we have left the European Union, if we leave without a deal.\"  Her comments came as a new poll suggested trust in her ability to handle Brexit was falling quickly.  An ICM poll for  found she had an eight-point lead over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over who could be trusted to negotiate a good Brexit deal down from 16 points in January and 34 points before the 2017 General Election.  On the parties\u0026rsquo standing, it put Labour on 41 per cent, up two points from a fortnight ago, Tories down one point on 40 per cent, with Lib Dems on eight points, Ukip on five and the Greens on three.  Earlier, Mr Coveney made clear Dublin would back any request from the UK for an extension to the Article 50 process to give more time to negotiate its withdrawal from the EU.  While he said there was still time to reach agreement by October, he called for an \"intensification\" of the talks at official level over the summer to resolve outstanding differences.  The Irish minister warned that certain elements of the UK negotiating position as set out in the UK Government\u0026rsquos Brexit White Paper would be difficult for Brussels to agree to although he noted that the document had made negotiations \"easier\" by backing away from earlier red lines.  Mr Coveney dismissed suggestions that amendments to the Brexit legislation had forced on the PM by Eurosceptic backbenchers would prevent agreement on a \"backstop\" arrangement for the Northern Irish border.  His remarks came ahead of a meeting on Thursday between Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, and Mrs May\u0026rsquos trip to Salzburg on Friday for talks with her Austrian counterpart.  On Tuesday, the PM confirmed that as the Brexit talks entered their final weeks she was taking personal charge of them with Mr Raab \"deputising\" for her in Brussels.  Tory Eurosceptics voiced concerns that the Brexit Department had been \u0026ldquosidelined by No 10 and Mrs May\u0027s Europe chief adviser Olly Robbins, amid increasing speculation that divisions within the Conservative camp could result in a no-deal Brexit.  In a separate development, Lord Trimble, the former First Minister of Northern Ireland, warned that any attempt by the Irish Government to impose post-Brexit tariffs on trade with the UK would lead to an upsurge in smuggling at the Irish border.  The Conservative peer said an increase in smuggling would have the \"delightful\" side-effect of diverting criminal elements away from paramilitary activity by giving them something more useful to do.  But he said the better solution would be the removal or reduction of tariffs across the whole British Isles.  The former leader of the Ulster Unionist Party called on Dublin to press Brussels for a British Isles exemption from the requirement to collect tariffs on trade with countries outside the EU.  \"It\u0027s in its own interests for them to speak to the EU about tariffs and about the reduction or elimination of tariffs within the British Isles.  \"That would be a huge step forward for everyone and it would solve all the other problems, including the problems that have been manufactured by people over the course of the last year or so,\" added Lord Trimble."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-pledges-post-brexit-farming-industry-fit-for-the-future","story":"  The Prime Minister will set out the UK Government\u0027s plans for a post-Brexit farming policy, explaining how the EU\u0027s Common Agricultural Policy subsidy system based on land farmed will be replaced with a system of public money for public goods.  She will make clear to local farmers and food producers that she is committed to safeguarding animal welfare, supporting the production of high quality produce and protecting the farmed environment.  \"Leaving the EU presents us with a unique opportunity to transform our food, farming and environmental policies so we can have a healthy and prosperous agricultural industry that is fit for the future and helps us to leave the environment in a better place than we found it.  \"Scrapping the Common Agricultural Policy and introducing a simpler system which provides funds in return for public goods, like improving water quality, reducing emissions and planting wild flower meadows to boost biodiversity, is fundamental to our new approach, Mrs May declared.  \"I want to make the most of the freedoms provided by Brexit to design a new scheme that is less bureaucratic and does away with the overly prescriptive information farmers currently have to provide to apply for grants.\"  In a roundtable with farmers, landowners and agricultural organisations in Llanelwedd, the PM will also reiterate her commitment to maintaining current funding levels until the end of this Parliament to ensure farmers have the certainty they need to plan for their business.  She added: \u0026ldquoThis Government is committed to supporting the half a million people who work in agriculture and growing our world leading food and drinks sector, which contributes over \u0026pound100 billion to the UK economy.

Violence, bombings, corruption, and above all the ubiquitous and pernicious influence of the military and intelligence services have always made elections in Pakistan fraught affairs.  Yesterday\u0026rsquos vote was no exception with the election getting off to the worst possible start. In thewestern city of Quettaa suicide bomber killed at least 29 people near a polling station, marking the beginning of a divisive election contest pitting cricket hero Imran Khan against the party of jailed ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.  With so much at stake and given Pakistan\u0026rsquos\u0026rsquo past election record, it would have been too much to expect this poll to be violence free.  No prime minister in the country\u0027s history has ever completed a full five-year term in office. With the polls now closed and if things continue to run smoothly, then it will only be the second time there has been a civilian-to-civilian handover of power after a full term. The first was in 2013.  But even with voting now finished many Pakistanis stillexpect an acrimonious election aftermath. True to historical form, the country\u0026rsquos military top brass and shadowy influential security service, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI), have consistently made their presence felt throughout the election campaign. Few expect that to change.  For months running up to the election, accusations have grown that the military and ISI were the hidden power behind Mr Khan\u0026rsquos bid to become Prime Minister.  Pakistan watchers point to themilitary\u0026rsquos guiding hand being visible in the partisan judiciary that went after ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who now languishes in jail with his daughter.  Sharif\u0026rsquos accusation, made earlier this year, that the Pakistani army facilitated the deadly 2008 terrorist attack in the Indian city of Mumbai, is widely believed to have crossed the line, one that a pliant Pakistan media dubbed as \u0026ldquotreacherous.  For decades Pakistan\u0026rsquos military leadership has regarded itself as the custodian of the nation, one still defined by its birth in the bloody partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947.  While the military has denied it has backed any particular candidate in this latest vote, observers have warned that the security forces have helped promote candidates running for Mr Khan\u0026rsquos PTI party, and moved to silence its opposition.  Most analysts are convinced that the military\u0026rsquos favourite is Mr Khan or the \u0026ldquoladla\", or spoilt child, as he has been dubbed by by his opponents.  The fact that almost 400,000 troops were deployed at polling stations yesterday to prevent terrorist attacks only further raised suspicions as to the army\u0026rsquos intentions.  \u0026ldquoThe so called soft creeping coup which was conceived by the deep state and midwifed by the judiciary during the last few years has not only culminated in full fledged authoritarian control but has also acquired some hard dimensions, warned Afrasiab Khattak, a former Pakistan senator and political analyst in Pakistan daily newspaper The Nation before yesterday\u0026rsquos vote.  Others shared his concern including the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) who warned of \u0026ldquoblatant, aggressive, and unabashed attempts to manipulate the outcome of the elections.  According to independent international election observers, many were unable to gain visas until days before the vote. Typically such monitoring officials are usually in a country for weeks ahead of any polling day.  \u0026ldquoWe have never had a situation like this in any of our 150-plus missions, Dmitra Ioannou, the deputy chief observer for the EU observation mission, was quoted as saying.  Pakistan is voting at a time when its foreign relations are the most damaged they have been in decades. Currently the US and Afghanistan accuse Islamabad of allowing Taliban militants and itscohorts, like the Haqqani group to operate out of sanctuaries in Pakistan. Also within the region meanwhile a standoff with archrival India over the disputed region of Kashmir grows ever more tense.  Just last month Pakistan was also placed back ona terror financing watch list. Pakistani officials attending a meeting in Paris had tried in vain to persuade the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to keep Pakistan off a list of nations with inadequate controls to prevent terror financing and money laundering.  Pakistan was included on the watch list for three years until 2015, and FATF has now told the Islamabad government what needs to be done, in order for it to be taken off the list again.  For some time now Mr Khan despite hispast as an Oxford-educated, globetrotter has kept up a consistently anti-Americanism rhetoric in his political campaigning.  In doing so he has constantly thrown down the gauntlet to other Pakistani leaders for allowing the country to be used as a \u0026ldquo hired gun by Washington.  Should the Pakistan military have been supporting his election campaign to the extent many believe then he will doubtless now have to tone down his criticism of Washington, leaving him kowtowing to the Pakistan army in foreign-policy matters.  The country\u0026rsquos military and intelligence establishment has long been the main beneficiary of security aid before its love affair with the US turned somewhat sour.  To that end now Pakistan\u0026rsquos generals are keen to salvage their relationship with the Washington and the Pentagon.  For the moment few expect the post election period to be anything other than an even more intensified struggle for control of the government. For decades now many analysts have warned that the military\u0026rsquos role in Pakistan\u0026rsquos volatile politics has only left the country in a permanent cycle of tumult and economic stagnation.  Whatever political manoeuvring now lies ahead among the country\u0026rsquos leaders, real power openly or otherwise will almost certainly stay in the hands of the Pakistan\u0026rsquos generals not any political party or Prime Minister. It seems for now the era of \u0026lsquohard coups\u0026rsquo has been replaced with a \u0026lsquosilent coup\u0026rsquo period."},{"url":null,"title":"ken-smiths-diary-lets-face-it-fudging-it-snap-your-fingers","story":"  STILL enjoying the kids off from school?

The remainder in the 342-seat Lower House of Parliament includes reserved seats for women and minorities. Voting for two seats was postponed after one candidate died during the campaign and another was disqualified.  But before even half the votes were counted, Mr Khan\u0027s leading rival Shahbaz Sharif, who heads the Pakistan Muslim League - the party of jailed ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif - rejected the vote, generating fears that the losers could delay the formation of the next government. Television projections give his party about 61 seats.  Mr Sharif said that \"our democratic process has been pushed back by decades,\" adding that \"had the public mandate been delivered in a fair manner, we would have accepted it happily\".  Complaints have also emerged from the independent Human Rights Commission, which issued a statement saying that in some places women were not allowed to vote.  In other areas, it said \"polling staff appeared to be biased toward a certain party,\" without naming the party.  In the days before Wednesday\u0027s election, leading rights activist IA Rehman called the campaign \"the dirtiest\" in his country\u0027s troubled journey toward sustained democracy.  Analysts have expressed concern that disgruntled losers could create instability for the incoming government, which will face mounting challenges - including a crumbling economy, a crippling debt and a raging militancy.  As voting got under way on Wednesday in the south-western city of Quetta, the Baluchistan provincial capital, militants sent a suicide bomber to a crowding polling station to carry out an attack that killed 31 people.  The election, in which Pakistanis voted for the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, and the four provincial assemblies, marked only the second time in Pakistan\u0027s 71-year history that one civilian government has handed power to another in the country of 200 million people.  Yet there have been widespread concerns during the election campaign about manipulation by the military, which has directly or indirectly ruled Pakistan for most of its existence. The military had deployed 350,000 troops at the 85,000 polling stations.  Pakistan\u0027s military spokesman General Asif Ghafoor called accusations of interference \"malicious propaganda\".  Throughout the night and into Thursday, Mr Khan\u0027s supporters celebrated outside party offices countrywide. Most of the revellers were young men, who danced to the sound of beating drums draped in Tehreek-e-Insaf\u0027s black and green-coloured flags."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8124440.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sfa-chief-says-scottish-football-is-a-safe-place-for-children-after-critical-report","story":"  Ian Maxwell spoke out after a review into historic child sexual abuse in Scottish football called for sweeping changes while finding that child protection policies are \"not fit for purpose\".  The Scottish Football Association-commissioned report said that there were gaps in the system that still leave children at risk.  The head of the sport\u0027s governing body said the report\u0027s recommendations would be implemented where possible.  They had already appointed an Implementation Manager and were created a Safeguarding Advisory Group as recommended by the inquiry led by Martin Henry, the former executive officer of Lothian and Borders Police\u0027s child protection office.    Mr Maxwell said: \u0026ldquoOn behalf of Scottish football I would like to offer my most heartfelt apology to those with personal experience of sexual abuse in our national game.  \"We acknowledge the very deep impact experiences of sexual abuse has had on many individuals and that is why we are strongly committed to learning from these experiences.\"  Scottish football\u0027s child abuse investigation finds policies are \u0027not fit for purpose\u0027  He added: It is abhorrent inj football and society that these things still occur.\"  After saying that the game had made \"significant strides\" to address issues in the past 18 months, he said: \"I think Scottish football is a safe place for children and it\u0027s up to us to ensure that going forward.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased that the report has recognised the progress that the Scottish FA and its members have made since the board issued a directive in 2016, however, we recognise there is still much to do.  \"As the report also states, football provides a tremendous outlet for young people in Scotland and it is our responsibility to protect and cultivate that for future generations.\"  The report had said there is a shortfall in money and resources to deal with the problems.  The interim findings highlighted a need for football clubs to accept greater responsibility for affiliated youth clubs. And it also called for\u0026nbspa designated Scottish FA board member for safeguarding issues.  A full report is not expected to be published until legal proceedings have been concluded.  Mr Henry, who until October, 2016, was national manager of child sexual abuse prevention charity Stop it Now! Scotland was brought in in February, last year, to front an investigation which agreed to examine \"processes and procedures\" in place both currently and historically in Scottish football.  Concerns at the time were linked to seven Scottish football clubs. Four of them, Celtic, Rangers, Motherwell and Partick Thistle are in the Scottish Premiership and three are in the Scottish Championship, Hibs, Falkirk and Dundee United."},{"url":null,"title":"facebook-releases-documents-revealing-scale-of-pro-brexit-social-media-ads","story":"  The details came as the social media giant saw more than \u0026pound80 billion wiped off the value of its shares amid a warning of slowing user and sales growth.  Nine of Vote Leave\u0026rsquos ads were viewed between two and five million times out of hundreds paid for by the pro-Brexit campaign, suggesting the group had paid significantly more to have the messaging appear more prominently in people\u0027s newsfeeds on Facebook.  Five of the nine Vote Leave adverts which, were viewed some two to five million times focused on immigration.  Of those, two identical adverts stressed plans for Turkey to join the EU with an image showing a large red arrow sweeping across Europe from Turkey to the UK.  The accompanying text read: \"The EU is expanding and plans on granting Turkey visa-free travel. This will put enormous pressure on the NHS, our border security and economy.  \"Have we lost control? We already send \u0026pound350 million to the EU every single week. Shouldn\u0027t we spend our money on our priorities instead? Vote Leave Day - Thursday 23 June. Is This Good News? Click No! Vote Leave.\"  At the time, negotiations for Turkey to join the EU had completed one of 35 \u0027chapters\u0027 of legislation and as a member the UK would be able to veto any plans.  Another popular advert claimed more than five million \"new immigrants\" were heading to the UK, the figure appears to be based on the highest possible projection of EU immigration to the UK by the Office for National Statistics at the time.  Three identical adverts which were seen by between two and five million people urged voters to \"spend our money on our priorities like the NHS\", citing the disputed figure of \u0026pound350m per week sent to the EU.  As one of the figureheads of the campaign, Boris Johnson featured heavily in many of the more widely-seen adverts.  In two, the former Foreign Secretary is quoted talking about immigration and in a third he is pictured in front of a Vote Leave lorry with a caption urging people to vote for Brexit.  Adverts ranged over a number of subjects from protecting polar bears to banning the sale of whale meat. Other messages accused the EU of wanting to \"ban tea kettles\" and \"kill our cuppa\".  Vote Leave paid for significantly more Facebook advertisements around the EU referendum than the other campaign groups in the documents released to a House of Commons committee inquiry into fake news.  However, one advert from BeLeave published the week before the referendum was seen by more than five million people, more than any other adverts released by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.  It read: \"Being under EU rule is severely restricting our ability to grow and reach our full potential as a great nation. It is time we take a stand for Britain. Let\u0027s vote to leave the EU on 23 June so we can have a clear and prosperous future! BeLeave in Britain!

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 8:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Vet finds Major mess on record paddle run","story":"A VET caused a bit of a splash when she swapped her stethoscope for a paddleboard to complete a memorable Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats journey.Cal Major was paddling along the seas, rivers and canals of Britain in order to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our waters and to also raise money for mental health charities the Samaritans and Vetlife.The 30-year-old completed her momentous journey inside 59 days \u0026ndash as she\u0026rsquos the first to do this by paddleboard, she is now the official world-record holder.Cal, who hails from North Devon, is keen to highlight not only the untidiness of plastic litter left on our beaches and in our seas but also the damage it can do to both the sea wildlife and the environment.She found many examples of plastic pollution along the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and hopes people will give more though to their use and disposal of plastic products.\u0026ldquoThere was plastic wherever I went. I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected. One morning in Wigan I counted 691 plastic bottles just in the first hour of paddling.Cal admitted that the marathon paddle was not without a scary moment or two.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Mull of Galloway paddle was one of the more terrifying moments. Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful. When I was 12 miles across, the waves were almost as big as me and the storm came in early. I was very scared and felt very alone \u0026ndash panic was starting to set in.\u0026ldquoOnce I was within a mile of the island, and knew I was safe, fear turned to exhilaration, and the feeling of being propelled along by 20-30 knot winds was incredible.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 8:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Wick River green slime passed safe for canines","story":"THE Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has allayed fears that an algae that has appeared on the surface of Wick River is harmful.Dog walkers in Wick had voiced concerns about the \u0026ldquogreen slime following the poisoning death of a dog by blue-green algae in the River Conon in Ross-shire last week.A spokesman from Sepa said that officers had confirmed the presence of enteromorpha in Wick River.\u0026ldquoEnteromorpha is a type of green algae\u0026nbspwhich, unlike blue-green algae, is not harmful.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work. We have got to do a new support leg for the bridge.\"But the funding allows us to forge ahead with the things we need to do. It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer. The SSE funding will be spent over the next two years. After that we are embarking into major works which will require more extensive funding.\"Mr Vandyke says the local community has played a major role in helping to secure the future of Cromarty Harbour, which has existed in some form for over 200 years.He added: \"We would like to thank the community because their support has been so strong. The harbour has been there for 200 hundred years. It\u0026rsquos the town\u0026rsquos harbour and while its use has changed over the last few years, it\u0026rsquos still very important.\"It\u0026rsquos of historical significance.

As a result, Newton Road will be closed from July 19 at 7am to July 22 at 11am. And Dingwall No.1 in Craig Road will be shut from 7am on August 2 to 11am on August 5.Final installation and testing of the new barriers will also require fortnight-long road closures at both sites \u0026ndash Dingwall Middle from October 15 to 29 and Dingwall No.1 from October 29 to November 12.David Dickson, infrastructure director for Network Rail Scotland, said: \"These level crossing upgrades represent a significant improvement for rail and road safety.\"Our consultation work with the local community earlier this year indicated support for these improvements and we look forward to seeing them delivered.\"Our aim is to deliver this work with as little disruption as possible, however, we will require two short closures this summer plus two week road closures for each crossing to install and test the new equipment this autumn.\"Train services are not expected to be affected by any of the works.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 8:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion.

The utility giant said underlying earnings at its generation and supply unit had soared by more than 300 per cent to £165.8 million in the six months to the end of June. It added that the  division had “recovered” from a poor performance in 2017.            Average customer consumption increased by 4 per cent year-on-year over the period, which was mainly due to cold weather from the Beast from the East around late February and March.            Customer numbers now stand at about 4.9 million, down from the five million reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.The latest figures come after the Big Six energy company, which is owned by Spanish multinational Iberdrola, increased prices in a move that hit some 950,000 households.The firm hiked its standard variable gas and electricity prices for around a third of its customers from 1 June, with impacted households facing an average increase of 5.5 per cent.ScottishPower attributed the rise to an increase in wholesale energy costs, alongside costs associated with upgrading meters and delivering electricity from low-carbon sources.The firm has been investing in wind power, having completed a £650m project to build eight wind farms north of the Border.            Over the first six months of 2018, ScottishPower also started construction on a major offshore wind farm in East Anglia, the East Anglia ONE project.Underlying earnings at the ScottishPower Renewables business rose 27 per cent to £205.1m while they nudged up 3 per cent to £399.9m at the SP Energy Networks division.The group has also completed the installation of one million smart meters. It is working with four installation partners across the UK, installing at peak 2,700 meters per day with a UK-wide workforce of more than 500 people.ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: “Everyone knows that installing smart meters hasn’t been plain sailing for suppliers. Challenges have been overcome, with more to face, but it is a major achievement to reach one million installations.            “The potential for customers to reduce consumption and save money is only one benefit. As the energy industry becomes fully digital in the years ahead, the new meters will be a vital cog in a smart network that supports electric vehicle charging, manages locally produced renewable energy and even the storage of electricity at home.”On the half-year results he noted: “All of our business areas are performing in line with expectations. Our investment in onshore wind last year has seen an increase in electricity generated, and excellent progress has been made on delivering the £2.5 billion East Anglia ONE project.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774174.1532601783!/image/image.jpg","title":"end of era as john menzies offloads distribution arm","story":"        Logistics group John Menzies has entered into a conditional agreement to sell its print media division Menzies Distribution to investment funds managed by \u0026#8220transformational\u0026#8221 private equity investor Endless LLP in a \u0026#16374.5 million deal.

And not in a good way. This kind of heatwave is no laughing matter. Having been brought up in Glasgow, I am not equipped to deal with this.             I know my parents are Indian, but they came here to escape this kind of godawful evil weather. Cats and dogs are begging to be shaved it’s so bad. And the heat has clearly affected British politics because it has gone into meltdown.            MPs head off for their summer break this week and some of us would normally say it was “well deserved”, but they haven’t covered themselves in glory and leave behind what can be only be described as a genuine political crisis.Brexit has trapped us in a what Danny Dyer brilliantly described as a mad political riddle where the business of running the country has effectively ground to the halt. Although to be fair that hasn’t just happened this parliamentary term. Government ministers, advisers and the civil service haven’t had the bandwidth to focus on the rather difficult day job of running the country since David Cameron called the EU referendum because the toxic politics of the campaign took over. Ironically for a campaign which was dominated by the slogan “take back control”, domestic British politics has spun out of control. We have huge problems the length and breadth of these shores which need the best brains, focus, hard-work, determination and good faith – from funding gaps in the NHS to the lack of opportunities for young people to housing and infrastructure – and sadly our most of our leading politicians seem to be woefully lacking all these qualities.The Conservatives are the equivalent of a circular firing squad and are so busy fighting over Brexit and jostling for who will succeed Theresa May, who will be out the door faster than you can say “strong and stable” once some deal is done on Brexit – although, her words “no deal is better than a bad deal” are proving to be rather prophetic. READ MORE: David Mundell: There’s no alternative to the Brexit White Paper            A ‘no deal’ and crashing out of the EU on WTO terms is now a growing prospect. If this happens, it won’t be because the EU won’t accept a deal, it will be because hard-right Tory Brexiteers won’t. After Chequers, she sent Ministers out on the airwaves to say that this was the absolute, final Cabinet position, then the very next day she gave in to Jacob Rees-Mogg. With this kind of the steel, I bet the EU are sh****** themselves. She then conceded that she would have to probably give way to the EU on further areas, which is true but how do you think the hard-right in her party are going to take those concessions? They are emboldened, and they will not give way. They never have. Ever since the days of John Major, who was out over the weekend calling for a second referendum.I am much more sympathetic to this notion now, but it won’t magic away all the problems – it would simply unblock the Brexit impasse we have in Parliament. What would the question or indeed questions be? How many options would have you have? Would you even include the option to overturn the decision and remain in the EU or would that be seen as undemocratic and unfair? And remainers like me might get a nasty shock – a second referendum may deliver an even bigger margin for leave because, if people hated Westminster in the run-up to the referendum, you can bet your bottom dollar they would want to give it an even bigger two-fingers after two years of arsing around.But it may be the only option if politics can’t find a way though. To give you an idea of how messed up the Government’s Brexit plans are, yesterday it was announced that the Brexit Department will no longer be negotiating Brexit. You literally could not make this stuff up.READ MORE: Food safety controls under threat from no-deal Brexit            Speaking of which, a special mention must go to Vince Cable, leader of the Lib Dems who last week managed to miss a critical vote on Brexit because he was allegedly at a dinner discussing setting up a new party to stop Brexit. Former leader Tim Farron also missed this important vote because he was busy making a speech about homosexuality and the church. It’s great to see the political titan whose only contributions to the last general election was the phrase “smell my spaniel” and a massive row about gay sex is back out there on his “it’s a sin” tour.But things took a more sinister twist when the deputy leader of the Lib Dems, Jo Swinson, was swindled out of her vote at a knife-edge moment because the Tories basically lied to her. She has just had a baby and is still on maternity leave. Julian Smith, the Tory Chief Whip, promised she would be “paired” with MP Brandon Lewis during a crucial Brexit vote. This is an arrangement where if an MP is sick or they can’t be in parliament for an important vote, their “pair” from the opposing party agrees not to vote so that they cancel each other out. It’s based on trust and honour ... Lewis then broke that promise and voted. This is outrageous. The Tories are saying this was an innocent mistake. Do me a favour. We weren’t born yesterday like Swinson’s baby! Lewis and Smith clearly lied, and should be sacked. It’s polite to give up your seat for a pregnant woman – they should be made to give up theirs. Permanently. What a low moment for politics.And don’t look to Labour for any comfort on Brexit. Yesterday Corbyn showed his true Eurosceptic heart by making a speech where he tried to sell us the economic “benefits” of Brexit, which got praised to the rafters by the Leave campaign. He also has a massive bridge to sell you, with a unicorn waiting for each and every one of you on the other side. So, the chances of Labour blocking Brexit or backing a second referendum or a ‘people’s vote’ are pretty slim. Mind you. They have bigger fish to fry right now. Like picking the mother of all rows with the Jewish community over anti-semitism and trying to make communism fashionable again.I really do despair. Never have we needed better politics.

I have long considered myself an avid radio listener. It is a habit ingrained by weekend afternoons in my grandfather’s kitchen, where after a daunder back from the bookies, we would gather round the wireless and listen intently to proceedings from Ascot or Newmarket, where the rising pitch of the commentators vied for attention with the rush of hooves and the desperate, hopeful shouts of the crowd.            I should probably count myself lucky that I never developed an affinity for the gee-gees as a consequence, but I will always be grateful for that early introduction to a medium that felt more immediate than television ever could.            Growing up with one foot in the analogue age, I kept the flame burning, and with the advent of the internet and the proliferation of digital radio stations, my habit became hopelessly and permanently entrenched. I have lost count of sleepless hours given over to Ira Glass and John Hockenberry on National Public Radio’s Talk of the Nation, discussing obscure issues in a distant country in a way that felt relevant and intimate.Glass, of course, went on to create This American Life, a radio show which morphed into one of the world’s most popular podcasts. Even today, each episode is downloaded by around 2.5 million people. If that particular show’s success is well established, it would appear the popularity of its medium has yet to peak. The latest analysis by Rajar, the official body in charge of measuring radio audiences in the UK, shows that as of this spring, some six million adults across Britain listened to at least one podcast a week.That number might appear relatively small – just 11 per cent of the population – but when you assess it the proper context, its scale – and growth – is really quite something. Only last year, the number stood at just 4.7 million, and the number of people now downloading podcasts now outstrips the reach of BBC Radio 5 Live.

In March, the corporation announced the appointment of its first-ever podcast commissioner, Jason Phipps, and it clearly believes it can build on the 240 million annual downloads of its programmes. It, along with other broadcasters and media companies, faces a stern challenge in attracting a younger demographic who do not consume their media via linear channels, and podcasting is one the most obvious areas to focus on. Recent research by Acast, one of the main competitors to iTunes as the world’s leading podcast platform, found that two thirds of listeners are aged between 16 and 34. What is more, nearly a fifth of them have only started listening in the past six months. The success of the BBC’s evolving podcasting operation alone will not solve that problem, but it is a start.            It is hard, however, to see the projected ‘boom’ coming to pass. Podcasting is hardly a new, emerging medium. In one form or another, it has been a staple of our media diet for well over a decade. iTunes first started collating a directory of podcasts as far back as 2005, when the term was named as the Merriam Webster dictionary’s word of the year. Within the space of 12 months, the comedian, Ricky Gervais, helped propel the medium into the public consciousness, with millions of users downloading his comedy shows.  For a good few years, the podcast charts were dominated by such high-profile figures looking to emulate Gervais’s success. And while the podcasting world is still inhabited by any number of celebrities, its greatest treasures are to be found elsewhere.

I subscribe to more than 70 different shows, and on an average week, I will listen to around 12 hours of programming. Over the past year, the lion’s share of this has consisted of podcasts which focus on US politics, such as FiveThirtyEight, Pod Save America, Trumpcast, Trump Inc, all of which provide incisive takes on the Trump administration.            But so too, my podcast diet is supplemented by an ever-widening spectrum of programmes that embrace niche subjects. On the one hand, it includes the likes of Trade Talks, a weekly insight into international trade deals, and The Tip Off, which interviews leading journalists about how they came across some of their biggest stories. On the other hand, it takes in Wrestle Me, where comedians Marc Haynes and Pete Donaldson revisit every WrestleMania event from 1985 onwards in chronological order, and Cult of Geshcast, in which two Glaswegian friends, Gavin Spence and Phillip Maddison, discuss various cults and sects through the ages. These are my niche interests, but whatever you are interested in, or even curious about, chances are there is a podcast out there for you. There might not be a boom in 2018, but with the bewildering choice of programmes out there, it’s hard to see how podcasts will fail to become an increasingly prominent part of our media landscape."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774013.1532550395!/image/image.jpg","title":"strictly come dancing sensation ed balls on his newest tv show","story":"        Ed Balls is discussing the dos and don\u0026#8217ts of donning a leotard.                No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick.

It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.

A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays.

Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nThursday 26 Jul 2018 8:39

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

This was subsequently delivered in a letter to the Belfast Headquarters of BBC and RTÉ. \nSinéad Ennis said she will be meeting with RTÉ’s new Head of Sport in the coming days and has called on them to “put measures in place” to end the disenfranchisement of sports fans in the north.”\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27417  ","story":"Declan Kearney addressing The Ard Fheis.\n Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nMutual respect and parity of esteem apply equally to our shared Orange and Gaelic cultures, unionist and Republican traditions, and British and Irish identities. - Declan Kearney\nEnsuring that facts should not get in the way of repeating misrepresentationswas a thought which struck forcefully when I read Nelson McCausland’s recentarticle on Orange culture.\nNelson repeated his view that Sinn Féin is prejudiced against the Orange Order,and again ridiculed our commitment to equality, respect and reconciliation.\nHe deliberately and falsely characterised the actions and words of myself andother Sinn Féin leaders.\nThe fact is Orange culture is an integral part of Irish society.

There are many, many more people who have no sight at all. \n  \n“I’ve done training with a guide dog so that I will be ready when the time comes but I’m not at that stage yet.”\n  \nBrian’s latest sponsored walk went ahead in early July and saw around 50 people joined in at very stages of the 13-hour hike.\n  \nIn the previous two years, Brian’s efforts have brought in almost \u0026pound10,000 and he is hopeful that his latest walk will be the best fundraiser yet.\n  \nBut it is not only about raising funds for Brian.\n  \nHe believes that the charity needs to be highlighted for the vital work it does in providing guide dogs.\n  \n“These animals are trained to the highest degree so that a blind person can put their full trust in thedog.\n  \n“That is the real key factor.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs.

Creating an atmosphere where all people can thrive in peace is the surest way to secure our precious Union.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk19-004cr.jpg","title":"65135  ","story":"    \nTRIBUTES have been flowing in for iconic Ballymoney historian Mr Alex Blair who passed away suddenly at his Lisboy Road home, Kilraughts on Saturday.\nDescribed by one of his many friends as a big man, a private man, a very friendly person the retired Dalriada teacher wore many hats in the town and wider afield.\nHe was a writer and lecturer, the confidante and biographer of the late Mollie Holmes, a traveller and raconteur who had decades long associations with Ballymoney Drama Festival and the Ballymoney Agricultural Show.\nThe Service of Thanksgiving for his life takes place in Kilraughts Presbyterian Church tomorrow (Wednesday) at 11.30am. The house is strictly private.\nFriend and Chairman of Ballymoney Drama Festival, Mr Mac Pollock said: He was a big man in every way, a very private man though he had many public faces he was a very friendly person, was genuine and had many long-standing friendships.

Noel McClean had cut short his holiday in Scotland and returned home when he heard\u0026#160 the news.\nSpeaking to a packed church at the Service of Thanksgiving Rev. McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev. Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

It’s important that we show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community and send a clear message that inequality and discrimination of any kind is simply not tolerable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAfter the meeting the DUP issued a statement accusing Sinn Fein of hypocrisy.\n\n“The DUP outrightly condemns any act of hate or violence against any member of the community.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDeputy Lord Mayor, Paul Duffy\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“The motion before the Council on Monday night was divisive as there was a significant element of hypocrisy given that Sinn Fein proposed a motion which focused heavily on hate crime, yet the IRA, which by Sinn Féin’s own admission has been inextricably linked to that party, committed some of the most heinous crimes during ‘The Troubles’ for which members of IRA have not been held responsible. \n\n“The families of victims of IRA violence deserve the greatest respect and the ultimate show of remorse for crimes committed against these victims by the IRA would see Sinn Fein ask specifically that those members of the IRA who committed murder and other acts generated by hatred, come forward to face the courts. All other attempts at deflection under the so called banner of ‘equality’ by Sinn Fein will be highlighted by our DUP council grouping.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The motion appears to have been submitted very late in the day and the implications of such a motion are far reaching. Due process hasn’t been followed, no call for an equality impact assessment as is custom and practise when displaying flags and emblems and we are going against our policies and procedures.\n\n“We as a party fear that this result will open the floodgates for all groups to suggest flying all types of flags from civic buildings, we would argue very strongly that official local authority flagpoles should only be used to fly the nation’s flag or indeed the armed forces flag which incorporates the Union Flag. \n\n“These are the reasons we objected in the strongest possible terms to any other flag being flown and are somewhat dismayed and astounded that only the DUP and Independent councillor David Jones voted against such a haphazard and unprofessional approach. We will on this occasion have to consider taking legal advice and utilising the call in process.”\n\nFollowing the meeting Cllr Jones said: “I opposed the Notice of Motion. My reasons were quite clear. I have no issue or problem with the LGBTQ+ community. Where I have a major problem is such a motion being proposed by Sinn Fein while over a period of thirty years their military wing, PIRA, carried out the most heinous indiscriminate murders on people no matter their sex, religion, colour, age or sexual orientation and have to date offered no remorse or apology for their actions. I do not believe Sinn Fein should be seen as s of minority groups, no matter who or what that group may be.\n\n“During a fractious debate members of Sinn Fein attempted to shout me down. They went as far a proposing a Motion of Censure on me to stop me from speaking at the meeting but following a vote this Motion failed.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“At the close of the debate and despite a rejected amendment being proposed the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion was passed. I and the DUP voted against while the UUP did not vote.\n\n“Once again I feel this shows the desperation of Sinn Fein to latch onto an issue they believe will show them to be the defender of a minority. No doubt they will say I am biased against the LGBTQ+ community. I totally repudiate this. I have worked with, socialised and have friends from the LGBTQ+ community. When I spoke to some of them before last nights meeting and I explained my reasons for not supporting the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion they were equally scathing of it saying they did not want to be used by a political party to bolster their image.”\n\nCllr Catherine Nelson proposed Cllr Jones be censored but this failed due to support from both UUP and DUP members. \n\nCllr Duffy said: “His disregard for the authority of the Mayor fell well short of the behaviour expected from members in the chamber.\n\n“In dredging up the past he used it as an excuse to deny this gesture of solidarity to members of the LGBTQ+ community. I am delighted our motion passed despite his opposition. We will be the first council in the North to fly the rainbow flag and that is something to be proud of.\n\n“I urge members of our local LGBTQ+ Community, and their families, to join me this coming Tuesday night for a celebratory event during Pride Week in Craigavon Civic Centre 7-9pm.”\n\nThose who are interested in attending the event are asked to contact the Lord Mayor’s Office on 028 3752 9633 as they need to know numbers for catering purposes.\n            \n

agent owen becomes secret agent","story":"\nMove over Tom Cruise, there\u0026#8217s a new Mission Impossible star in the making - Portadown Estate Agent Owen Matchett.\n\n                \nAnyone who follows the Williams Estate Agents Facebook page will know only too well they are given to more ‘off the wall posts’.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWell next week they are set to scale new heights of daring to promote the agency - by ‘dangling upside down from a helicopter’ in a Mission Impossible spoof video.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEstate Agent Owen will transform into a Secret Agent - resplendent in full tactical gear - for the movie skit as he tries to place a sold sign on one of his properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThrow in a some stunt driving and a 30 foot fall into an air bag and you have the perfect recipe for an eye-catching and fun video.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind the video Owen said: “A few years ago we did a James Bond skit for the movie Spectre coming out. It got 18,000 views. With Mission Impossible coming out this week, I thought I’d do a bit of a spoof,”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\nFilming took place at Todd’s Leap in Ballygawley over the weekend and speaking before his movie moment Owen said: “I’m going to go for it big time, I’m just hoping people will find it amusing and entertaining.\n\n“It will involve a high speed helicopter chase, high speed rally driving, abseiling and me jumping 30ft into an airbag.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, while we don’t want to give away the ending, the concluding message is ‘At Williams, no mission is impossible’.\n\nBut Owen’s exploits won’t just be confined to Facebook, as while he is being filmed doing his stunts a TV crew will be along to film him being filmed for a TV slot (that’s nearly as confusing as a Mission Impossible plot).\n\nThe company had approached Owen after they saw his James Bond spoof and had asked him, if he was doing something similar, to invite them along so they could cover the story.\n\nOwen went on to say: “I do these videos thinking outside the box, something a bit different from what other agents might do with housing market figures and such. I don’t do that type of thing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’m a bit of a movie buff and love action movies and hopefully people will get a laugh and some enjoyment out of it.”\n\nThe video will be released on the Williams Facebook page next week - along with details of a competition to win a family day pass to Todd’s Leap.\n\nAnd to conclude in Mission Impossible style: This message might not self destruct but it is tomorrow’s chip paper!\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8572863.1531997113!/image/image.jpg","title":"lockhart hails donaghcloney success","story":"\nDUP MLA Carla Lockhart has congratulated Lower Iveagh West Orange District on a successful Twelfth July week and parade. \n\n                \nThis year Donaghcloney hosted the demonstration and large crowds flocked to the town.

I want to congratulate the officers of Lower Iveagh West Orange District and their organising committee, Donaghcloney Linen Greer Association. I know many hours of planning and preparation went into this event but to good avail.

And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"internet sensation set to go on stage","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA WEST\n Belfast comedian whose parody of chart hits from the likes of Ed Sheeran – which has seen him go ‘viral’ on the internet – is about to headline his own show such is the demand to see him live.\nBrooke’s Paddy Rafferty, known to fans as Paddy Raff, will perform at the Foundry Club, formerly the Stiff Kitten, in the city centre on Friday July 27. The 34-year-old told the Andersonstown News how he had always been performing skits and his own take on songs throughout the years and decided that 2018 was his year to try his hand at stand-up.\n“Even back at school I would always try and change the lyrics of songs, whatever was popular at the time. The ability to flip lyrics dead quick always came naturally to me,” he said.\nPaddy explained how he started to play guitar in his teens and began to use his talent to create comedy videos which he has since posted on his social media Facebook page and which now have received thousands of hits.\n“I have my own take on Ed Sheeran’s ‘Galway Girl’ – I do ‘Broadway Girl’ and instead of Fountains of Wayne’s ‘Stacey’s Mom’ I sing about Stacey’s Ma. I’ve only really been performing since March but it has really taken off and it’s going really well.”\nPaddy said he is really looking forward to performing at The Foundry – which is already approaching a sell out.\n“I have always been a big fan of Billy Connolly, who funnily enough used a guitar as well in his early gigs. I’ve always loved stand-up comedy and never for a minute thought I’d actually be up there doing it myself.\n“It’s great to know that people will be coming next Friday to see and hear my stuff, I’m not being complacent, I’m putting the work in so it’s going to be a great night for everyone coming along.”\nPaddy will play The Foundry on Friday July 27.

A petition is to be opened ,which, if signed by 10 per cent of the North Antrim electorate will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley being forced to stand down.\nSir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, who delivered the findings, concluded that Mr Paisley was guilty of \u0026#8220serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute\u0026#8221.\nIn response, the DUP have suspended Paisley “pending further investigation into his conduct.”\nSinn Féin North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said the DUP cannot dismiss the fact that its Mr Paisley lobbied in defence of a regime with a shocking human rights record.\n “Much of the focus of the Ian Paisley scandal has revolved around his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government,” he said.\n“That is understandable given the focus on integrity in government following the DUP’s involvement in a number of scandals including RHI, Nama, Red Sky and dark money for Brexit.\n “These have all severely damaged public confidence in the political institutions but this latest scandal also calls into the question where the DUP stands on fundamental questions of human rights.\n“Amnesty International has said that serious human rights abuses were committed with impunity by the Sri Lankan regime during the conflict there.\n“Yet, after receiving his gifts from the Sri Lankan government, Ian Paisley actively lobbied the British Prime Minister to oppose a United Nations resolution to establish an international investigation into the human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n“Does the DUP leadership really believe that it is acceptable to dismiss the fact that one of its MPs lobbied in defence of a regime that carried out mass murder, war crimes and gross human rights abuses?\n“This is a litmus test for the DUP leadership and If Ian Paisley does not do the right thing and voluntarily resign, his party should compel him to do so.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ms decision to close lisburns bow street mall store described as a blow to city centre","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nSDLP MLA Pat Catney\n has said the loss of the M\u0026#038S Simply Food store in Lisburn’s Bow Street Mall is “a blow” to the city centre, to staff and shoppers.\nIn a statement Marks and Spencer said it had opted not to renew its lease on the Simply Food store but that no jobs were at risk with staff having been advised that all existing employees at the Lisburn branch will be redeployed.\nThe closure of the food store, which has been open ten years and employs 40 staff, will further add to the many already shuttered and empty retail slots in the complex following the liquidation of its anchor tenant BHS.\n“Any loss of business in Lisburn is a drain,” said Mr Catney. “Any business closure makes it more difficult for retailers to build their product up,” he said. “It’s the old saying – there’s no point going to market if there are only two stores in it. We need to be working to lift, build, Lisburn city centre up together.”\nMr Catney told Daily Belfast that the issue of paid city centre parking is taking a heavy toll  as shoppers are choosing to travel and spend their money elsewhere.\n“I personally don’t like the paid parking from a trading point of view, the parking attendants are very, very strict and I’m calling upon the city centre management from us as MLAs to really look at a strategy that will lift where we work in the city.”\nMr Catney described as “disappointing” the fact the Belfast Rapid Transit (BRT) scheme was not rolled out to Lisburn. “You have this Glider bus running from West to East in Belfast that could’ve pulled on out here. This is a commuter town, there are so many developments being built here with a lot more young people and families moving here so I would’ve liked to have seen that considered.\n“I will be contacting Translink over the coming days to request that bus services to Sprucefield shopping centre are frequent enough for those consumers who previously used to shop at M\u0026#038S in the town centre.”\nThe M\u0026#038S Simply Food store is expected to close its doors in the autumn. \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"}]
