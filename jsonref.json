[{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry father Charles barely spoken MONTHS","story":"Share this article Clarence House yesterday repeated that Charles had \u0027no knowledge\u0027 of the \u0027cash for access\u0027 allegations, but it did not comment on whether Harry raised concerns with him about Mr Mahfouz.The Metropolitan Police has made initial inquiries into Mr Fawcett, but a full investigation has not been launched.Ex-Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker, who filed a criminal complaint about the matter three months ago, said: \u0027The fact Harry dropped this guy should have been a red light for Charles, but clearly he ignored that and drove straight through.\u0027Royal commentator Peter Hunt added: \u0027Prince Charles presented Mr Mahfouz with his CBE in 2016. Did Prince Harry tell him about his concerns in 2015?\u0027Just one of the many questions the Metropolitan Police could ask father and son if they choose to investigate.\u0027Harry first met Mr Mahfouz in 2013 at a pub in Chelsea, west London, owned by Mark Dyer, a former royal equerry, The Sunday Times revealed.They discussed the duke\u0027s charity Sentebale, set up in 2006 to help people in Lesotho and Botswana affected by Aids, following his gap year in Africa.The newspaper reported the pair met again at Clarence House the following year after Charles had also met Mr Mahfouz, where Harry allegedly joked: \u0027Has father beaten me to it and got the money?\u0027In February 2013, Mr Mahfouz donated £50,000 to Sentebale. Later that year he gave £10,000 to Walking With The Wounded, another charity of which Harry was patron.A spokesman for the duke said: \u0027The duke had one planned meeting with this donor eight years ago, did not introduce him to any members of the Royal Family, and expressed his concerns about the donor.\u0027The Prince\u0027s Foundation is being investigated by the Scottish charities regulator over claims it accepted a six-figure sum from a wealthy Russian donor which was later rejected by its ethics committee. An independent investigation into the \u0027cash for access\u0027 allegations commissioned by the foundation last week found \u0027evidence of communication and co-ordination\u0027 between Mr Fawcett and \u0027fixers regarding honorary nominations for a donor between 2014-18\u0027.Sentebale said: \u0027It is entirely normal and legitimate for patrons to meet potential donors, on whose support we depend. This includes the two donations received in 2013-14 from the Mahfouz Foundation – donations that we would not have accepted if we believed there was anything improper behind them.\u0027  Harry throws his own father under the bus  By Rebecca English To say that the Prince of Wales\u0027 relationship with his sons is complex is an understatement.Both William and Harry have historically accused Charles of being a \u0027laissez-faire\u0027 father – one more preoccupied with weighty affairs of state and his considerable philanthropic legacy than bathtime, wrestling matches and bedtime stories.It\u0027s not entirely fair, of course. The reality when it comes to the Royal Family – as with any family – is always more complicated.Like other royals, Charles was \u0027deeply, deeply\u0027 hurt at the manner of Harry and Meghan\u0027s bitter exit from the family in 2020.Still, as Harry and William\u0027s relationship descended into acrimony, their father tried to remain a non-partisan figure – partly because Charles has always shied away from personal confrontation with his sons, but also because he genuinely wanted to retain a Swiss-like neutrality between them.But, while disappointing, the statement from the prince\u0027s Los Angeles-based spokesman effectively throwing his father \u0027under a bus\u0027 over the \u0027cash for honours\u0027 investigation did not come as much of a surprise. The comment, which was belatedly issued after a newspaper highlighted Harry\u0027s own links with Saudi billionaire Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, was at pains to try to emphasise the younger prince\u0027s own foresight. It glossed over Harry\u0027s private meeting with Mahfouz in a close friend\u0027s pub in Chelsea – and a subsequent encounter at Clarence House where he was said to have joked: \u0027Has father beaten me to it and got the money?\u0027Much as there is the notion of collective responsibility at Cabinet level, so is it within the folds of the Royal Family: defend your position directly and to the point by all means, but not at the expense of your nearest and dearest.Harry\u0027s statement, however, was liberally sprinkled with digs at his father – the reference to \u0027the CBE scandal\u0027, for example. Then there was the suggestion that the younger prince and his advisers saw sense at the earliest possible opportunity, when Charles\u0027 former senior aide Michael Fawcett – and presumably the Prince of Wales himself – did not.As for the claim that Harry \u0027expressed his concerns\u0027 about the donor... well, to whom? Certainly no one within his father\u0027s household has any recollection about this at all.Indeed, I understand that Charles wasn\u0027t even aware until this weekend that his son had met Mahfouz in a west London pub, let alone encouraged his charity to accept any money from him.If Harry was that concerned about the Saudi billionaire, surely he could have warned his father, possibly when he saw him at his London residence the same day.It was also no secret, subsequently, that Mahfouz had become a major donor to Charles\u0027 charitable endeavours – he had a wood named after him at Dumfries House, the Scottish seat of his charitable empire, after all.Contrary to claims in the BBC\u0027s recent controversial documentary on royals and the media that the three royal households are all too quick \u0027brief\u0027 against each other, Clarence House was again maintaining a dignified silence last night.But one loyal friend of the Prince of Wales felt obliged to ask: \u0027If Harry indeed had such deep concern about this man and his \u0027motives\u0027, then why on earth did he not tell his charity, Sentebale, to just hand the £50,000 he had given them back?\u0027Prince Charles \u0027deeply shocked \u0026amp hurt\u0027 by Harry and pair have barely spoken in 8 monthsPrince Harry and Charles: has their fragile relationship been damaged beyond repair?"},{"url":null,"title":"Matt Hancock 43 reveals kept dyslexia secret 20 years","story":"Share this article He wrote: \u0027Even though after the diagnosis and training, I understood more and was able to read and write more confidently, I still held onto what I felt was the embarrassment of having dyslexia. \u0027I made some bad mistakes. I misspelt words in important documents. I still struggled, and was only saved by the development of spell-check and later autocorrect. They were lifesavers.\u0027Unlike a learning disability, intelligence isn\u0027t affected by dyslexia - a difficulty experienced to some degree by one in every 10 people in the UK.Orlando Bloom, Richard Branson, Leonardo da Vinci, Walt Disney and Albert Einstein are among some of the most famous people to struggle with dyslexia.Mr Hancock added that those who cannot read or write properly are more likely to be unemployed and involved in crime.  \u0027Simple early screening and education would go a long way towards helping dyslexics into the workplace and out of the cycle of crime, and be so valuable to businesses who can make the most of all that potential,\u0027 he wrote.Mr Hancock added: \u0027I look forward to making the case to the House of Commons for why this reform is so vital.\u0027I welcome the new Education Secretary\u0027s recent commitment to a White Paper tackling illiteracy. I will tell my good friend Nadhim Zahawi that we cannot tackle illiteracy without getting to grips with dyslexia.\u0027Everyone has a contribution to make, and it\u0027s our job in politics to help people make it.

Today\u0027s Bill is a small step to releasing that potential.\u0027Mr Hancock said: \u0027I\u0027m passionate about improving support for dyslexic people - and all those with neuroersity - because I feel I was one of the lucky ones.\u0027I had brilliant teachers and decent maths, so could get to an amazing university which could set me on the right path.\u0027  \u0027Was it your dyslexia that meant you misread the social distancing rules?\u0027 Phillip Schofield is condemned for mocking disgraced former Health Secretary Matt Hancock\u0027s dyslexiaPhilip Schofield was criticised today for mocking Matt Hancock by asking, \u0027Was it your dyslexia that meant you misread social distancing rules?\u0027The disgraced health secretary was caught on CCTV passionately kissing his married aide and millionaire lobbyist Gina Coladangelo against the door of his Whitehall office in June. Mr Hancock, who is now estranged from his wife, Martha, brushed off the jibe on This Morning, telling Schofield: \u0027No, I can\u0027t blame that on dyslexia or anything else.\u0027Co-host Holly Willoughby, who has revealed she is also dyslexic, responded to his question with a smirk. Although the MP also responded with a slight grin, critics called the host\u0027s comments \u0027disgusting\u0027 and \u0027pathetic\u0027, with one Twitter user accusing him of \u0027totally unnecessary and disrespectful behaviour towards people with dyslexia\u0027.  Share this article"},{"url":null,"title":"Physics academic wrongly sacked shouting tribunal rules","story":"Share this article \u0027There was a view amongst some senior members of the department that Dr Plaut had been allowed for years to get away with behaviour which should really not be tolerated.\u0027Others valued her contribution, and accepted that she was not an unpleasant person even when being loudly argumentative in discussion.\u0027Dr Plaut says that any negativity towards her by reason of her interpersonal communication style is unconscious racism as it stems directly from her inherent cultural upbringing.\u0027She finds particularly offensive the suggestion that her loudness is shouting, and finds the application of that word to her to be a great insult.To sum up the great weight of evidence given to us, the vernacular phrase \u0027she is a Marmite person\u0027 is not inaccurate.\u0027The hearing was told that in 2017 the University\u0027s Human Resources department became involved in Dr Plaut\u0027s teaching style and she worked with staff to agree on wording to describe it to students.Dr Plaut took offence to being called \u0027unnaturally loud\u0027 and insisted on being called \u0027naturally loud\u0027.By this point, the tribunal heard that there was friction with the department and \u0027over time HR gradually became less and less tolerant of Dr Plaut\u0027.The panel was told that in January 2019 she was suspended for gross misconduct over a \u0027significantly exaggerated\u0027 claim she shouted at a female student and shone a \u0027laser\u0027 in their eyes.Dr Plaut insisted she had been explaining the scientific concept of saturation and had used a desk light in the student\u0027s face to demonstrate it. However, she apologised for the incident.In a letter giving her a written warning, the university \u0027accepted that Dr Plaut\u0027s loudness was largely unintentional, but expressed concern at her apparent inability to moderate it\u0027.At a return to work meeting in April of that year, the panel heard her relationship with the university\u0027s senior management soured further when she suggested one of her bosses was not open to criticism in his role as head of equality.Bosses \u0027seized\u0027 upon that comment to launch further disciplinary action against her, the tribunal was told, even though the academic concerned did not want it pursued.When, soon after, another of Dr Plaut\u0027s students told the university he wished to change lecturers, bosses falsely told him he could only do so if he complained about her.It resulted in Dr Plaut facing a fresh allegation of \u0027frequently shouting during meetings with a PhD student causing them stress and anxiety\u0027.The tribunal found senior management including Provost Janice Kay wanted to get rid of Dr Plaut.\u0027It is plain that (they) all wanted Dr Plaut dismissed and set that in train\u0027, the report said.The physicist was suspended again and sacked following a disciplinary hearing in December 2019.Finding the university guilty of harassment, victimisation and unfair dismissal, Employment Judge Paul Housego criticised the way an academic of such long standing could have been treated.\u0027This is a very large organisation, of very high reputation, and high professional standards in dealing with the careers of its academics are to be expected,\u0027 he said.\u0027This obligation is the greater when dealing with someone who has spent 30 years working for them. Senior management had decided that Dr Plaut would not be tolerated further.\u0027The good things she had done over the years were given no weight.\u0027The Tribunal does not doubt but for some people Dr Plaut\u0027s approach to life was highly uncomfortable, but that fails to appreciate that this is a façade behind which the evidence is of a long serving dedicated and caring academic.\u0027Judge Housego suggested one way of dealing with Dr Plaut\u0027s perceived shouting was to be given help and an opportunity to change her approach.Dr Plaut - whose additional claims of racial and sex discrimination were dismissed by the panel - will now be awarded compensation at a later date."},{"url":null,"title":"Lib Dem election candidate issues grovelling apology Goebbels tweet","story":"Share this articleLib Dem candidate forced into grovelling apology after \u0027comparing Priti Patel to Nazi chief Goebbels\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Now Durham student union demands principle RESIGNS insulting humiliating Rod Liddle talk","story":"Share this articleSouth Principal calls students “pathetic” for protest over “transphobic” guest – Palatinate"},{"url":null,"title":"Sturgeon ramps orders Scots work home","story":"Share this article Ms Sturgeon added that her government is not currently considering a blanket closure of schools in Scotland.A primary school in Paisley has already been forced to close for a week due to a suspected outbreak of the new Omicron variant of Covid, with some class groups at Todholm Primary now being required to self-isolate.Scotland now has 99 cases of the new variant - which Ms Sturgeon warned \u0027may be significantly more transmissible than anything before\u0027.She spoke out after being pressed on the issue by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross.He said that while shutting down schools \u0027may be necessary in extreme circumstances\u0027 there had been an agreement between parties earlier in the pandemic that \u0027children\u0027s education must come first and closing schools should only ever be a last resort\u0027.He called on Ms Sturgeon to confirm if this was still the Government\u0027s position and for her to \u0027say that no plans for school closures on a national basis have been discussed by her cabinet\u0027.The First Minister told him: \u0027It is absolutely the case that protecting the education of children remains a top priority.

Bryant said this did not equate with what the officials said earlier in the hearing, when they denied any knowledge of No 10 being involved in allowing the animals to be evacuated. Sir Philip Barton, head of the Foreign Office, told Bryant he was not aware of this. He said they had not set out to mislead the MPs. Bryant said the letter implied that “the prime minister’s fingers are all over this”. He went on: “And you are just - I’m hesitant to use the words cover up, but that what it feels like.” There was silence for a short moment, before Barton said again: “I wasn’t aware of the letter.” Barton did not reply. Bryant says ministers then got hundreds and hundreds of emails about Afghans needing help, and he says the Foreign Office pretended these were being properly considered, when they weren’t. Barton says he does not think this is “an accurate characterisation” of what happened.In the Lords Goldsmith was asked by Lord Foulkes, a Labour peer, why Johnson prioritised animals over people. Goldsmith said claims about the PM getting involved were wrong. He told Foulkes: In her statement Sturgeon stressed that the Scottish government is already encouraging people to work from home. But she said she was now asking employers to ensure that this was possible for workers if they allowed it during lockdown last year. She told MSPs: Chris Bryant (Lab) says he has spoken to ministers who think it was a mistake for the UK to open its evacuation scheme potentially to so many Afghans. He says it seems “terribly cruel” to imply to people that they might be eligible for rescue. For example, journalists could have been eligible, he says. Nigel Casey, the PM’s special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, says ministers were responding to pressure, including from MPs. That is why they created a new system for people not eligible for help under Arap (the Afghan relocations and assistance policy). He says media organisations were among those saying the government should help certain people not covered by Arap.So-called 10-minute rule bills almost never become laws, but they allow MPs to publicise proposals for legislation which sometimes subsequently get adopted by government. Asked whether Raab should be in office, Starmer said:  That is a slight difference from the line adopted this morning by Emily Thornberry, who said Raab should resign now. (See 10.53am.)Barton says he left for holiday on 9 August. He repeats the point about how he has reflected on this. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the committee, tells him this “sounds less credible every time your repeat it”. He adds: “It sounds platitudinous.” Bryant says this line “just feels a bit scripted now”. Bryant also tells Barton that, on 9 August, it should have been obvious there was going to be a crisis. Barton says it was not clear at that point.Dyer said he “reached out” to Carrie when the government was refusing to help. “I went publicly on social media and said to the prime minister ... and I did reach out to Carrie Symonds that evening, and some ministers I was in contact with, including Zac Goldsmith to say ‘look, who’s in charge here?’,” he said. Dyer claimed that the government changed its policy as a result of his intervention. Downing Street (see 12.25pm), and Johnson personally (see 1.26pm), have both insisted that the PM was not involved.Barton says they received an uprecedented volume of correspondence. They had to prioritise, he says. He says they ensured every MP got a reply. Q: Who authorised the prioritisation of animals over people? That did not happen, says Barton. Q: So how did animals get evacuated before people? Barton disputes that that happened. He says there was a charter flight. Casey says the charter flight was only allowed out after the evacuation of people had finished. Q: How much staff time did allowing the charter flight out take? Casey says this did not distract from the evacuation effort. Tom Tugendhat, the committee chairs, says if the gates to the airport were open to allow the people and animals boarding the charter flight on to the flight, they could have been open for other people – such as the five-year-old son of an interpreter who used to work for him, who wanted to leave. Casey says the Taliban had not approved a further evacuation. Bristow says the Taliban were becoming increasingly uncooperative.  He says he has checked with the commander on the ground if the operation with the animals displaced people. He says no plane failed to land or take off because of this, and no one else would have made it through if the animals had not gone through. Alicia Kearns (Con), a former civil servant, says if soldiers had not been escorting animals, they could have been escorting another planeload of people. Bristow says the trade-off is not that simple. Bristow says the people who were in the system for evacuation had been processed. He says he cannot say with certainty soldiers were moving animals through the gate. He says his understanding is that no one else would have been able to get out.Q: What do you make of the criticisms published by Raphael Marshall? Barton says the points in the Marshall memo are ones that the Foreign Office will look at in its lessons learned exercise. He suggests some of the criticisms are fair, but not others. Q: It feels as if we were getting false assurances that this was being dealt with, but you were being overwhelmed. Barton says it was “incredibly difficult” to deal with such a large number of people seeking help. He says, as part of their lessons learned exercise, they will want to look at how they have the capacity to deal with so many emails in an emergency like this. It was not “lack of urgency” that was the problem, he says. He says the problem was to do with the complexity of the problem. Q: Marshall writes about people only working eight-hour days. That is not what should be happening, he says. Barton says there is not a clocking-off culture in the Foreign Office. But, as for working eight hours, there was a three-shift system to cover 24 hours. So that is why people had to clock off. Q: Marshall says you did not have the people. Barton says this was not about work-life balance. This was about ensuring people did not burn out.He asks Barton to tell him the date. Barton says he does not want to answer for the former foreign secretary. But he appears to confirm that the Foreign Office will have a record of this. McDonald asks him to tell the committee. Barton says he will take away the request, but does not confirm that he will supply the date.From the Times’ Henry Zeffman From the Independent’s Rob Merrick From the Times’ Tom Newton Dunn He says he returned from holiday on 26 August. As my colleague Patrick Wintour reports, that was almost a fortnight after Kabul fell. Barton says he does not want to say. He was partly in the UK, he says. Q: Have you changed holiday plans before? He repeats the point about having reflected on this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a0a002f2f12c70f3f2f519a1926fed2f397cd3f/0_340_2792_1675/master/2792.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=951bb46ee0e06258a03e6402d7c60a83","title":"covid news live omicron likely to become dominant variant harvard researcher says france to close nightclubs","story":"Prof Alex Sigal, a professor at the Africa Health Research Institute, said there was “a very large drop” in neutralisation of the Omicron variant relative to an earlier strain. The lab tested blood from 12 people who had been vaccinated with the PfizerBioNTech vaccine but had not received a booster shot. Researchers found there was about a fortyfold reduction in vaccine-induced antibodies that could neutralise the Omicron variant. The preliminary data in the manuscript has not yet been peer-reviewed.It comes after a report claimed that then education secretary Gavin Williamson threw a party where he delivered a short speech before officials and ministers knocked back glasses of wine. Up to two dozen of Williamson’s staff gathered for “drinks and canapes” in the DfE cafe on 10 December, the Mirror reports. At the time, London was in tier 2, which banned any social mixing between households. One source told the paper:  Just a week before the party, Williamson urged people to take the “responsible approach” of following social distancing and self-isolation rules.A statement from the force said:  Speaking during a White House coronavirus task force briefing today, he said:  More data is expected next week, Fauci said, but it will take a few weeks to reach any definitive conclusions.Trisha Greenhalgh, professor of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, slammed Boris Johnson’s then press secretary Allegra Stratton for laughing in the footage. Prof Christina Pagel, a member of the Independent Sage committee, said the video was “damning” and revealed the government’s hypocrisy while people were making enormous sacrifices. Loughborough University data analyst Dr Duncan Robertson said the leaked video could impact how the public heed public health measures and restrictions.  In a statement, the AU said the measures effectively penalise governments for timely data sharing in line with international health regulations, and could act “as a disincentive for information sharing in the future, potentially posing a threat to health security on the continent and globally”.All three positive cases have a link to travel from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, the department said, adding there is no current indication of wider community transmission present.In the video obtained by ITV, an adviser to the PM is seen joking with Allegra Stratton, Johnson’s then press secretary, about “a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night”. The footage was shot on 22 December 2020, just four days after the date on which multiple sources have said there was a staff party inside Downing Street, which would have contravened strict Covid regulations in place at the time. Johnson’s spokesperson and several ministers have insisted that any event complied with Covid rules, without saying why, before the spokesperson changed stance on Monday, saying no party had taken place.  On Tuesday, Johnson’s spokesperson had reiterated that this was Downing Street’s view, saying: “I don’t think there is anything to add to what I have said previously. Our position has not changed.” But the video – recorded as part of preparations for planned daily televised briefings hosted by Stratton, which were later abandoned – will raise fresh questions about No 10’s version of events and increase pressure for a formal inquiry. Starmer said that during the lockdown last December people followed rules “even when that meant being separated from their families, locked down and – tragically for many – unable to say goodbye to their loved ones”, adding:  Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, described the video as “damning”, adding: Read the full story by my colleague Peter Walker here: A global trial of a Covid-19 vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline and Canada’s Medicago has produced “positive efficacy and safety results”, the companies announced. If approved, it would become the world’s first plant-based coronavirus vaccine.  The Omicron variant was not circulating at the time of the trial but GSK said it is planning to test the vaccine against the new strain.  GSK and Medicago have sought approval from the UK’s MHRA watchdog, the US Food and Drug Administration, Canadian regulator Health Canada and the World Health Organization (WHO).The country has seen a surge of Covid infections in recent weeks, followed by a rise in the number of hospitalisations. “We really wished we were done with the pandemic. But the situation is now so serious that we must put in place new measures to keep control,” the prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, told a news conference. “Therefore it will be a different Christmas holiday this year as well,” he said. No more than 10 visitors will be allowed in private homes, and people must keep a distance of at least one metre from anyone who is not a member of their household. The serving of alcohol must stop at midnight every day, he added. Companies hit by the restrictions will receive compensations from the government, the finance minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, said. The government last week reimposed some restrictions on travellers, requiring that anyone arriving in the country must test for the coronavirus and that people wear face masks in most crowded places, but infections have still continued to rise. The health ministry reported that the number of patients with coronavirus in hospitals rose by 618 to 12,714, the second-highest net one-day increase this year behind the net increase of 732 on 6 April when the patient tally was above 30,600. Due to one of Europe’s highest vaccination rates, a rise in new cases now has less impact on hospital numbers than in the spring. France also reported that the number of patients in intensive care units with Covid rose by 160 to 2,351, the second-highest increase this year. On 6 April, ICU numbers rose by 193 to 5,626. On Monday, France reported a seven-day moving average of nearly 43,000 new infections per day, a new high for the year, but the rate of increase has been slowing for over two weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"know yourself 9 steps to choosing the right course after the leaving cert","story":"One in four Leaving Cert students who go to college  drop out of their course before completing their degree. Photograph: iStockOne in four Leaving Cert students who go to college next year will likely drop out of their course before completing their degree. That’s based on trends identified by the Higher Education Authority over recent years. Most of those who won’t make it to second year will drop out for one key reason: they chose the wrong course. So, how can you make sure you make the right course choice? And how can you discern between a course you genuinely love versus something others say is your best bet? Derek O’Byrne, Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) registrar and vice-president for academic affairs, says students need to make decisions primarily based on their own interests and abilities. This conviction prompted WIT to launch its Right Student, Right Programme initiative, aimed at educating and informing students to pick what is right for them, rather than what they’re told to do. It’s a view backed by Alice O’Connor, an expert guidance counsellor at Educate Together Secondary School in Stepaside, Co Dublin. We asked both of them to identify what students need to know when making their call.1. Choose what interests youThis is the key piece of advice any guidance counsellor will give a student. “From transition year onwards, students should be thinking of the subjects they’re interested in,” says O’Connor. “What are your hobbies, values and skills – how might they fit into a career path, and are there courses that would take them there? In school, I liked art but I didn’t do well in my Junior Cert, although I did history of art in college.” 2. Think broad and beyond subjectsThere are so many subjects to choose at college, and most of them don’t directly map onto what’s available for the Leaving Cert. “If a student enjoys English, it doesn’t necessarily mean they should study it in college,” says O’Byrne. “Instead, they should reflect on what it is that they like about English. Is it poetry? Do they particularly like writing? Or, if it’s critical analysis, they might look at degrees that involve a lot of critical analysis: it could be that they mightn’t particularly want an English degree but would enjoy law, for instance.”Students also tend to understand the careers they have seen: if a parent, relative or friend is an accountant, engineer or teacher, they might be more inclined to follow that path.“This is part of the reason why we encourage students to think not in terms of particular subjects or careers, but in terms of skills and abilities,” says O’Byrne. 3. Do aptitude testsAptitude tests are a great way of identifying your interests. CareersPortal.ie and Qualifax.ie both have useful tests on their sites, while Stepaside Educate Together uses MyFutureChoice to help students make up their mind.4. Try tastersA growing number of third-levels institutions, including WIT and UCD, offer taster courses. WIT, for instance, runs the Try business engineering nursing and so on to let students try out the discipline that they might be interested in more than 1,000 students signed up in 2019. NUI Galway’s College Awareness Week includes taster talks across 11 subject areas, while UCD and Maynooth University run summer schools where students can get a taste of both college life and particular subjects.O’Connor advises that students should pay particular attention to the modules available on any given course, so they understand what the degree might look like.5. Talk to studentsIt’s easier to talk to students about their course and college if you happen to know them, but most third-levels today are keen for potential students to talk to their current students. NUI Galway has a Student Voice podcast featuring more than 20 interviews with students from a range of disciplines. TU Dublin and DCU applicants can use the Unibuddy system to chat directly and privately with a student on courses that interest them. Maynooth has a dedicated online chat facility – Ask a Student – where student ambassadors can answer questions about the degree programme, subjects, transition from school to university and student life at the university. But how can you know if those students are truly objective?“Ask them what they find interesting or exciting about the programme and the college,” O’Byrne advises. 6. Know the college and the city“While most open days have been virtual over the past two years, this has almost meant that students can find out about more colleges because they don’t have to travel to them all,” says O’Connor. “But if any student puts down a course option on the CAO without going to an open day, I’d question what they’re doing there. You need to hear the experience of students who have been on the course in that college.“College is about more than the course, so it’s important to pay attention to the societies, clubs and extracurricular options in the college,” O’Connor adds.Student accommodation can be difficult to secure, and college is expensive, so students should weigh up how it might cost to move out of home for college, as well as whether they want to live away from home, O’Byrne says.7. Minimum entry requirementsKnow the minimum entry requirements for a course, O’Connor and O’Byrne advise. They tend to be lower in technological universities and institutes of technology, says O’Byrne. “But if, for instance, the maths requirement is relatively high, it can mean the course has a lot of maths– this is one of the benefits of the taster programmes.”O’Connor says that, if students don’t think they’ll meet the minimum entry requirements for a particular level eight course, they might look at a level seven, from which they can progress to a related level eight.8. Don’t forget FETPost-Leaving Cert courses, apprenticeships and traineeships have never been such a good option. A growing number of school-leavers are going from school to a PLC, either to train for a particular qualification or as a stepping stone – perhaps if they didn’t get the CAO points – to a college course. 9. Get advice, but don’t be bound by itIt’s harder for young people to decide what they want to do with their lives, according to conventional wisdom. But many adults well into their 30s will tell you they haven’t got it figured out yet and, in any case, what you choose to do in college does not define your life: most people can now expect to change careers several times. Talk to your guidance counsellor, family and friends but, ultimately, don’t be swayed into a decision that you’re not happy with.“Whatever decision you make will not define your life, and college is about more than your course it’s about the skills and experience you pick up on the way,” says O’Byrne. How colleges are helping students make the right callVirtual talks and open days: They run across all third-levels, but UCC’s Nurturing Bright Futures, a six-module programme involving podcasts, articles, lessons, exercises and quizzes, are a must-do for students across Ireland, irrespective of whether they want to go to UCC or not.Tasters: On December 7th, UL’s arts, humanities and social science faculty will host a TY taster day involving live and pre-recorded sessions. UCD and Maynooth run taster events. Trinity College’s school of computer science and statistics offers small groups the chance to meet their teaching staff, while many of its schools have outreach programmes. Podcasts: Home at UL, available on Spotify, features talks on sports scholarships, taster courses and the CAO application process. NUI Galway’s Student Voice podcast includes interviews with students and graduates. The DCU CAO Hub hosts weekly podcasts with current students, virtual campus tours and a Pubble chat option where the DCU team can answer your questions. Prospectuses: It may sound obvious, but an online or print prospectus gives valuable information about colleges and courses.

Photograph: Joseph Prezioso AFP via Getty ImagesTaoiseach Micheál Martin has said there does not seem to be the “same urgency” in people availing Covid-19 booster shots as there was for the first and second doses of the vaccine.Mr Martin said that in the week commencing November 22nd, there were 208,000 appointments for booster shots offered but only 80,000 people turned up for them.He said last week 180,000 appointments were issued but only 93,000 turned up.The latest figures released by the Department of Health on Tuesday showed there were 5,590 new cases of Covid-19 with 505 patients in hospital of whom 117 are in ICU.Speaking in the Dáil on Tuesday, Mr Martin said in the over-75 age group, who have been taking up the booster shot, there has been a “significant reduction in the incidence of the disease”. He said the data showed the booster shot “does work” and believed it will have a significant impact on the Delta variant. “I can’t stress that enough,” he said. “The most important collective message we as a house can give to people today is to take your booster vaccine when you’re offered it,” Mr Martin added.“Vaccination is protecting people more than anything else against severe illness, against hospitalisation and against admission to ICUs.“The booster vaccination have been shown to produce very, very strong antibody responses and are likely to provide protection against severe disease, hospitalisation and death from most variants, including Delta and Omicron at least.”The latest figures show that more than a million booster dose vaccines, 1,005,656, had been administered up until Monday. Meanwhile, a number of Covid-19 vaccination and testing centres across the Republic have been forced to close on Tuesday as Storm Barra buffeted most of the Republic with high winds and heavy rain.Damien McCallion, the HSE’s national lead for the vaccination programme has urged the public not to travel to any medical appointments without first checking ahead.Mr McCallion also advised that ambulance services may be slower today as a result of the storm. He asked the public to “think carefully” before making an emergency call.Hospitals in orange and yellow zones will operate time critical treatments and emergency work while community services will be closed. Covid-19 testing and vaccination centres will be closed in status red areas and cancelled appointments will be rescheduled as quickly as possible, he said. In orange and yellow zones, local assessments were being undertaken in some sites - including tented sites and those in high locations.As of Tuesday morning and according to the HSE’s latest information, Covid-related services impacted due to Storm Barra include:In Co Clare the vaccination centre at Ennis Hospital is closed, as well as the Covid test centres.All Covid-19 testing centres and vaccination centres are closed in Co Cork.In Dublin the Pfizer dose 1 and dose 2 walk-in clinics at Dublin City University, Whitehall, north Dublin, are closed.The Covid-19 vaccination centre at Galway Racecourse is closed.In Co Kerry, all Covid-19 testing centres are closed along with all vaccination centres.The Covid-19 vaccination centre in the Carrick-on-Shannon primary care unit, Co Leitrim, is closed.In Co Limerick, all Covid-19 testing centres are closed.Co Mayo’s Covid-19 vaccination centre at Breaffy House Resort, Castlebar, is closed.In Co Meath the Covid-19 vaccination centre in Simonstown is closed.Co Sligo’s vaccination centre at Sligo Racecourse is closed.In Co Tipperary, Storm Barra has forced the closure if the Covid-19 testing centre in Nenagh.

Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins Photos Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has confirmed that the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) met on Monday to discuss approving vaccinations for children aged 5-11.Speaking on Claire Byrne Live on RTÉ 1, he said there would be a “significant decision” on vaccinations soon. He added that Niac met on Monday to discuss the priority order of vaccinations, “particularly in relation to children aged 5-11, which we are keen to get started in the new year”.When asked about comments made recently by Dr Cillian De Gascun, a member of Nphet, that he was “hopeful” the schools would reopen in January, Mr Varadkar claimed that school closures have not been discussed by Government. “The Minister for Education is responsible for schools, and what she has said, and certainly what I would support, is the schools are going to open in the new year... there has been no decision, nor discussion, about closing schools in January.”Mr Varadkar said the country was in a “peculiar” situation, clarifying comments that he made at the weekend. “This is the first time since the pandemic began that we are actually tightening restrictions at a time when things are objectively improving.”He said that despite the number of deaths and numbers of people in hospital and ICU declining, the public health advice was that some restrictions are necessary ahead of increased socialisation at Christmas. He said the possibility of a flu season and the emergence of the Omicron variant were also contributing factors to the decision to increase restrictions, as well as the fact that cases are stabilising at a high level, at about 5,000 cases being reported a day. He did not believe the new restrictions would be lifted before January 9th, unless there was a dramatic fall in hospitalisations and ICU admissions. Live events are set to be limited to 50 per cent capacity, pubs and restaurants will be limited to tables of six only with no multiple bookings, and nightclubs will close.

Photograph: Getty ImagesPeople due to receive their Covid-19 booster vaccine in coming weeks will primarily be offered the Moderna dose at HSE vaccination centres.The HSE is reported to have large supplies of Moderna due to expire next month, so that will be the main vaccine administered over coming weeks to the over-60s, over-50s, healthcare workers, and younger people in vulnerable groups – though it will be restricted to people over 30.Anecdotally there are indications some people may be reluctant to take the Moderna vaccine. This may be due to Irish stocks about to expire shortly andor confusion about its efficacy. This follows the company’s chief executive Stéphane Bancel warning last week the Moderna jab may not be as effective against Omicron as it had been with the Delta variant.The HSE has confirmed recipients will have no choice on what vaccine they are given.What type of coronavirus\u0026nbspvaccine is the Moderna jab?It is a new kind of synthetic “mRNA vaccine” – the PfizerBioNTech vaccine is from the same stable. They provide excellent protection against severe illness and hospitalisation – and have played a critical role in reducing Covid-19 deaths since being approved. A downside, however, is that the Moderna version must be kept at -20 degrees.Should people be worried about receiving a soon to be out-of-date vaccine?In short no, as they retain the ability to boost antibody production within currently approved time s – though inevitably potency wanes over time. The Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen (Johnson\u0026ampJohnson) vaccines were put on the market with emergency use authorisation of up to six months.This compares with a shelf life of two to three years for most vaccines and other medicines. This is an “inevitable consequence of getting the vaccines out of the door as quickly as possible”, chief scientist at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society Gino Martini told the journal BMJ.Months later, these “emergency” expiry dates remain in force for these vaccines. For approved Covid-19 vaccines, the initial shelf lives were based on data available at the time of submission for regulatory approval.The long-term shelf life has not been extended for any of the vaccines. A shelf life extension would require supporting evidence from relevant stability studies. Vaccine manufacturers are monitoring batches of vaccines with the aim of providing a longer shelf life probably the usual two years.What about the Omicron threat?While Moderna said existing vaccines including its mRNA version will probably be less effective against the Omicron variant, most experts believe they will continue to provide significant protection against severe disease and hospitalisation. It should be stressed, however, definitive indication has yet to emerge. That will be a matter of weeks, if not days.Moderna has confirmed it is developing an Omicron-specific booster though manufacturing the new vaccine would take time. Tens of millions of doses could be available in the first quarter of 2022, but scale-up would not happen until the second quarter – provided it is shown such boosters are required.What is the latest indication on the benefits of mixing vaccines?Evidence supporting a mixing of vaccine doses has hardened over recent months. A study this week shows combining a first dose of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine with a second dose of either the Moderna or the Novavax jabs results in far higher levels of neutralising antibodies and T-cells compared with two doses of the AstraZeneca jab.This finding also has important implications for lower-income countries that have not yet completed their primary vaccination campaigns as it suggests you do not need access to mRNA vaccines – and therefore ultra-cold storage facilities – to trigger an extremely potent Covid-19 vaccine response.The study also bolsters confidence that using the Moderna vaccine as a booster dose in people who have previously received the AstraZeneca jab should result in high levels of neutralising antibodies and T-cells.It follows separate data published last week suggesting the Pfizer and Moderna booster jabs can dramatically strengthen the body’s immune defences.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"donegal town dealing with mica if it was in dublin this would already be fixed","story":"Moville, on Donegal’s Inishowen peninsula, is among the worst affected areas in the country for mica and for the students in Moville Community College, the subject is rarely far from their minds.  Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t.

Mr Varadkar said the public and businesses should be operating on the basis that restrictions will be in place until “at least January 9th”. “Generally in our experience of the pandemic, when restrictions are imposed they tend to be extended, not reversed sooner than the date designated,” he told the Seanad on Tuesday. “I think we need to bear that in mind, any time I hear anyone say ‘it’s just for a few weeks’ in this pandemic, I always say right back to them how many times have you said that and it turned out to be for a few months. “That’s why we always make decisions mindful of the fact that what might appear to be a temporary measure can be one that lasts for months and even years.” He said he hoped 2022 would be the year the country moves away from restrictions. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said the Government will hopefully be in a position to announce on Wednesday he financial supports it intends to provide to the hospitality and entertainment sectors. He said he would like to make the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) “sector specific” but that he has been told it cannot be done. He said if the wage subsidy scheme definitely can’t be used on a sectoral basis, the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) would be used on a sectoral basis to target companies, businesses and workers who are now adversely impacted by recent restrictions. He said the measures may require primary legislation but added that the Finance Bill is currently in the Seanad where it can be amended to provide for “things like this”. Mr Varadkar said he and the Minister for Culture Catherine Martin were also looking at a number of possibilities including reopening the events sector scheme and some bespoke tourism schemes. The Tanaiste said the performance of the Irish economy has been “extraordinary” with labour shortages across the economy and a surge in applications for work permits. He said a number of businesses have incurred damage due to Storm Barra and that while most would be covered by their insurance, where companies were unable to get insurance they will be eligible for financial aid from his department. He said the scheme will be open in the coming days and no later than next Tuesday. From today until at least January 9th, indoor hospitality will be limited to parties of up to six adults per table, while nightclubs will be closed and indoor events limited to half a venue’s capacity.

His pun-strewn replies to accusations of bad taste confirm that this is “just” playful lib-owning at work. What, his entire being seems to ask, is the worst that could happen?Five years since the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump, it is still not understood how much populism boils down to antic rebellion rather than (the initial theory) economic grievance or (much more a leftwing thing) doctrinal belief. This is to some extent a movement of laughing cavaliers. Violence is not their wish, but nor do they recognise it as a plausible and unintended outcome of their doings.And why, given the lack of warnings from recent history, should they? Temporally, we are now almost as far from the second World War as it was from the American civil war. Few voters in the West have ever seen their domestic politics go catastrophically, life-endangeringly wrong (at least until the Capitol siege of almost a year ago.) Their appetite for political risk is therefore only natural. Consider it the civic version of the rash consumption and investment at the end of a business cycle, when the last crash is too remote to remember. “Stability is destabilising,” said the economist Hyman Minsky, who should have tried his hand at political commentary.To define the West’s problem as one of casualness, not wilful malevolence, is not to minimise it. In fact, it is much the harder problem to fix. The implication is that nothing short of a violent crisis will restore to people a healthy fear of the political extremes. Social media can be tamed, electoral dark money banned and education improved to little effect. These are tactical answers to a problem that could not be any more structural: in today’s grating argot, a lack of “lived experience” of the consequences of populism.Steady politics diesIt is a problem that by definition gets worse with time. When the second World War veteran Bob Dole died at 98 last weekend, the US did not just lose a dry wit and once-productive senator. It lost one of its few remaining messengers from the dire first half of the last century. Praise for him is really a lament for the generations who kept politics more or less steady from 1945 to just before the millennium.Liberals have had half a decade to study populism in its modern form. They still miss its ludic element: its treatment of politics as a kind of low-stakes team sport. Even those who credit it tend to blame the innate frivolity of iniduals, rather than a historic context in which no electoral choice has gone disastrously wrong in living memory. It cannot be a fluke that the most stable major democracy, Germany, is the one where the second World War, or rather its demagogic prelude, is simply never allowed to leave public discourse.If and when US democracy falls, giggling complacency, not moustache-twirling villainy, will be the presiding atmosphere. Of course, there are real believers and zealots on the American right. Former Trump aide Steve Bannon is one, as is the writer Michael Anton. But there were plenty of those in the 1990s and (in Barry Goldwater, a presidential candidate) the 1960s too. What has changed is the share of the wider populace who think no harm can come of extensively indulging them.Outsider cachetIn encounters with Trump voters and donors, a certain type recurs: unfailingly civil, vanilla in most of their tastes and often easier company than their leftwing equivalents. Some are just loyal conservatives. (Dole himself was not above a bit of tribalism.) Some, as is true of the most prominent Brexiteers, relish an outsider cachet that was hitherto denied them by their own wealth and whiteness. Almost all are hurt to be thought of as enablers of civic damage to their country. In toying with the likes of Trump, their main failing is one of imagination, not of conscience. They can’t picture the worst-case scenario. Two or three generations separate them from any salutary historical lesson about what a fissile material politics is.To regard anything in public life as “inevitable” is to succumb to teleology. Still, with the passing of Dole and much of his generation, it is hard to avoid the thought that societies grow rasher and more reckless as their memories of past crises fade. In other words, for the West, whose last existential mess is now a human lifetime ago, there is no avoiding the wages of success. It should expect its politics to wobble and lurch until such time as citizens taste the consequences again. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inedible food tears 20 minute daily walks around car park","story":"It resembled a scene from Alcatraz inmates circumambulating a tarmac yard, behind a high concrete wall spaced apart to prevent any fraternisation.These were no hardened criminals, however. Their misdeeds consisted of travelling back to the UK from “red list” countries. Rather than prisoners in a high-security prison, they were involuntary guests in a London quarantine hotel, paying thousands of pounds each for the dubious privilege of an 11-night stay.Among those forced to endure the experience were Kate and Alex Freed, a recently married couple who had travelled to South Africa for their honeymoon.But the honeymoon period is well and truly over, and they are now stuck in an awful hotel overlooking Heathrow serving inedible food.Perhaps the most grim condition is that they have to request to be allowed go for a walk outside. A security guard accompanies them downstairs, and they are allowed 20 minutes in the hotel car park before being told they have to go back inside, the pair say.Speaking on the third day of their 10-day quarantine period, Mrs Freed, 29, said: We’d been planning the South Africa trip for ages … we didn’t book it until the green list changed and the foreign travel advice was that it was safe to go to.Her 30-year-old husband added: To be charged for coming back to your country when the Government’s told you it’s safe to go, I think is just wrong.The couple flew back from South Africa on Dec 2, after having their original flight home cancelled due to the travel ban.It was the trip they\u0027d dreamed of, having been forced to rearrange their wedding day four times due to Covid.They said it took almost six hours to get from the plane at Heathrow to their hotel - the Holiday Inn Express at the airport\u0027s Terminal 4 - including waiting in a bus to be taken to their rooms.They put us on to a bus for the 30-second journey, but we were on the bus for three hours, Mr Freed explained.We were on a bus full of people, (with) no ventilation. It was the most unorganised mess ever. People were crying. It just seemed like something from a film, it was a bit mad, he added.After arriving at the hotel itself, the pair said they had food and other supplies delivered by their family, because the hotel food was inedible.You’re paying serious money and … it’s not substantial meals. Half the time it’s cold, half the time it’s just inedible, Mr Freed said.Travellers returning from red list countries originally faced a cost of £1,750 to quarantine in a hotel when the scheme was first announced in February. The price has now risen to £2,285 for the 11-night stay.I’d rather pay for security outside my flat and they can watch me not leave,” Mrs Freed said.I don’t disagree with quarantine if that’s what the Government want to do… It’s just the cost that’s come with it, she added.The way it is run is awful. I just feel something needs to be done about it, Mr Freed said.The Holiday Inn Express declined to comment, but the Department of Health and Social Care spokesman told The : The quarantine measures we have in place are minimising the risk of variants coming into the UK and safeguarding the hard-won progress of our vaccination programme.The majority of passengers who have used the Managed Quarantine Service have been satisfied with the service. All complaints are treated seriously and are investigated fully.Francesca Desquesnes was on holiday in South Africa, preparing for a safari, when the news came through from her sister that she needed to get home now. After trying and failing to book several flights home, she finally arrived at her accommodation for the next 10 days on Dec 2. It\u0027s inhumane. I would I would actually ask any MP to come and spend 10 days in the hotel like this and do what we do and then tell us it\u0027s humane.Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Grant Shapps - all three of you.Ms Desquesnes\u0027s will be allowed to leave at one minute past midnight on Dec 15, but has to endure another nine days yet. She told The : I think if you\u0027re not a person that is a strong person, and you weren\u0027t mentally strong, this would destroy you. I honestly believe that this would destroy most people\u0027s sanity.This is not humane or a nice way to treat British citizens. It makes me not want to be British.She - and others in the hotel - have taken their daily exercise into their own hands and started to defy the security protocols. You have to request permission to exercise. You contact security or reception but they don\u0027t answer. Sunday I went out for an hour and it\u0027s like One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest. And then today, I tried doing it, and they didn\u0027t answer. So I just looked out of my room and said I\u0027m going for a walk. And that\u0027s what a lot of people are having to do. We\u0027re just defying them.I think people are wearing masks and we\u0027re following the rules. But if we want to go out for exercise, then people walk.Ms Desquesnes said the food she\u0027s been served is worse than she ate at a HIV project in Africa where she lived with 30 people in a four-bed house. It feels like a prison, she said. It really does. It feels like I\u0027m in Guantanamo Bay. I will never go to prison if this is what it\u0027s like.Michelle Bovey-Wood is trapped at the Holiday Inn Gatwick - the same hotel lambasted by Richard E Grant - with her wife Sharon and their six-year-old daughter Leah. They landed on Dec 2 to find a room that sleeps two people, having paid more than £7,000 for one that sleeps three. Mrs Bovey-Wood was told that the sofa doubled as a bed, even though there was no sheet, pillows or duvet. They had to construct their own bed out of the cushions for their daughter. She told The : Quite honestly, as far as hotel experience goes, I\u0027ve had better in a non-graded hotel in the third world. It\u0027s total abuse. It has abused basically every single human right that we have - freedom of movement - in every sense. People are rude, it\u0027s isolating, there is no support should you need it. It\u0027s horrific.Mrs Bovey-Wood was told that because they had a child, the hotel would accommodate more exercise time - three half-hour slots a day. But they are being allowed out once a day - on Sunday for seven minutes and Monday for 10 minutes. Their exercise space is the hotel\u0027s courtyard - a strip of walkway around a patch of grass. The view is the rooms they are confined to for the other 23 hours and 50 minutes a day. And the hotel tries to send them out alone to avoid mixing with other quarantining families.Mrs Bovey-Wood explained: We were told initially that we could have two to three times a day, as is necessary with a child, and it would be up to half an hour at a time.If you request it, then you wait for about half an hour. If you\u0027re lucky. Somebody will come get you. They usher you down the passage. It was seven minutes. And then there\u0027s a hurry upstairs again. And they said, \u0027No, no, no, it\u0027s going to get better\u0027, the next day we were informed - 10 minutes.And that\u0027s it once a day.  The food served is hot if you\u0027re lucky, and Monday morning\u0027s breakfast consisted of a dry crumpet with a bit of bacon, bread with margarine, three blueberries and a black banana. Lunch is a sandwich, a packet of crisps and a stale chocolate bar. Mrs Bovey-Wood said: You get better care in prisons. I think when we got the bread and margarine this morning, and they inform you of 10 minutes of exercise - which I believe your basic human rights in a prison is at least half an hour\u0027s exercise a day - then you know that there\u0027s a huge problem here.They are given one cold drink a day, but Sharon is a diabetic. Sunday\u0027s drink given to them in the evening was Coke, which Mrs Bovey-Wood explained wasn\u0027t the ideal choice for a six-year-old at night. The mood in the hotel is tense, and the family can hear complaints through the walls. I can hear from our rooms - we can hear everything - there\u0027s a lot of complaining. Of course we have no Wi-Fi either, so we can\u0027t work right now. And smokers aren\u0027t actually allowed to go and use their time for smoking - they have to keep moving.What are they doing to keep sane within the confines of their room? The little one is doing drawing and she\u0027s getting some screen time.The Bovey-Woods are emigrating to the UK from South Africa, and they have not yet been told when they will be free to leave.It has not been the dream start ot their life in the UK. Incredibly rude staff, she said. We got shoved in a room that wasn\u0027t prepared for three people. So you asked for duvets and incredibly rude staff say you have to make up your own beds, that kind of stuff. It\u0027s just grown progressively worse because it\u0027s very clear that they don\u0027t have enough staff to deal with everything.Lauren Hopkins, a recruitment agency boss, says she faces another 11 days stranded in South Africa because there is no quarantine hotel room available until Dec 13 in the UK. She arrived in South Africa on Nov 21 for a 10 day holiday but fears she will not be back in her home until just before Christmas Day.I run a small independent recruitment agency and having worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to keep it going, I was in desperate need of a break. In reality, this experience has been anything but relaxing and stress free. In all honesty I am ashamed to be British. I, and hundreds of other British citizens have been completely abandoned by our own Government. To say I feel let down is a gross understatement. It\u0027s an utter disgrace.Flights aren\u0027t an issue, it\u0027s getting a hotel quarantine booking that\u0027s keeping us all here. They haven\u0027t put nearly enough on for the amount of us. We\u0027ve been trying since Sunday November 28th to get a booking with no luck. At the moment the 13th December is the earliest availability, meaning we come out Christmas Day and have to fund an extra 11 nights in South Africa. From the communication of the quarantine decision to the lack of any help or cooperation from the Embassy officials to the cancellation of flights homeward, to the severe shortage of quarantine hotels, the acts of our Government have been shocking in their ineptitude.I will never again place faith in politicians or in Departments of State.Richard E Grant has said he was left “confounded” after being stuck in a quarantine hotel charging more than twice as much as a similar alternative nearby.The Withnail and I actor said he had been visiting his 90-year-old mother in southern Africa when he was caught out by the change in travel restrictions.Speaking in a video on Twitter, Grant said: “I went to southern Africa to visit my 90-year-old mother and got caught by the red region Covid restrictions.“It took over a week and many cancelled flights to finally get home, for which I am incredibly grateful.“I understand that there are security costs in the hotel and you’ve got to pay for two Covid tests, but £228 a day to receive 3 meals a day of this very poor standard, in a supposed 4* Holiday Inn hotel, beggars belief.”Grant said his meals, which included a pre-packaged tuna and cucumber sandwich, a sausage casserole and fish and chips, would cost less than £20 to buy elsewhere.A nearby Holiday Inn not being used as a quarantine hotel costs just £89 per night, including breakfast – more than half the cost incurred by red list travellers.More from NewsChristmas work from home order being drawn up by GovernmentGhislaine Maxwell trial: Accuser Carolyn \u0026#39was paid $300 to massage Jeffrey Epstein age

Arcuri over claims he was linked to Jeffrey Epstein, saying he never met the paedophile and that it was Ghislaine Maxwell who put him in the businessman’s “black book”.On Tuesday, Mr Neil also threatened to take legal action against any Twitter users who reposted and endorsed the “vile and untrue accusations” on the social media site.The row erupted after Ms Arcuri, an entrepreneur who has previously claimed to have had a romantic relationship with Boris Johnson, tweeted images of Mr Neil’s address in Mr Epstein’s “black book” of contacts along with the suggestion the veteran journalist knew the disgraced financier.The tweet was deleted after Mr Neil said he was instructing his solicitors to take action over “this clear libel and defamation”.He also warned other Twitter users retweeting the accusation, saying: “I’m taking this action not just to hold Arcuri, who I’ve never met and have no interest in, to account but, more importantly, to establish that the twitterati can’t just promulgate evil lies without consequences. “If you think anonymity will protect you, you’re in for a big surprise.”Ms Arcuri later denied on Twitter she had deleted the tweet in response to the threat of litigation, saying it was instead because the image was already “all over the internet” and “all public domain”.Following the accusation, Mr Neil tweeted he had appeared in the black book as he had met Ghislaine Maxwell three times in New York in the mid-Nineties.He added: “I never met Epstein or frequented any of his properties. Think carefully before you sayimply anything else.”The  understands the meetings between Mr Neil and Maxwell were brief social encounters, in which Epstein was never mentioned, and that the pair had not spoken in the intervening 26 years.Sources close to the broadcaster said Mr Neil is now seeking “substantial damages” from Ms Arcuri, even if she offered an apology, and intended to donate any proceeds from the action to a charity supporting victims of child abuse.More from NewsChristmas work from home order being drawn up by GovernmentGhislaine Maxwell trial: Accuser Carolyn \u0026#39was paid $300 to massage Jeffrey Epstein age 14\u0026#39One in 10 who worked from home experienced domestic abuse, poll findsBureaucratic Britain has become addicted to permanent failureTop Foreign Office civil servant who was on holiday during fall of Kabul ‘should resign’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cheugy one mispronounced words year","story":"Cheugy, a term used to mock unfashionable millennials, has been voted as one of the most mispronounced words of the year.The word, meaning no longer regarded as cool or fashionable, is believed to be coined in 2013 and is used to target millennials, the oldest of whom are reaching 40, and aesthetics which include slogans such as “Live Laugh Love” and “Wine-O-Clock”.It was last month beaten to the top spot of Collins dictionary’s word of the year by NFT (non-fungible token), a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data.The word is pronounced “CHOO-gee”, but many people have mispronounced it as “Chuggy”, “CHO-jee” or “SHOE-gee”.The research, conducted by language-learning app, Babbel, and the British Institute of Verbatim Reporters is in its sixth year and has investigated which words have tripped up members of the public and news anchors alike.Other words which have made it on to the list included the surname of Gina Coladangelo, Matt Hancock’s former aide and lover, as well as the cryptocurrency Dogecoin and the pop singer Billie Eilish.Todd Ehresmann, a senior linguist at Babbel, said: “It’s always interesting for us to take our annual look at the terms that have been most mispronounced, as they are usually new vernacular or words that are borrowed from, or have origins in, another language.“As they come into everyday parlance, it’s great to see people at least having a stab at saying them correctly, because having the confidence to speak new words and phrases is one of the most important aspects when learning a language.”More from NewsChristmas work from home order being drawn up by GovernmentGhislaine Maxwell trial: Accuser Carolyn \u0026#39was paid $300 to massage Jeffrey Epstein age 14\u0026#39One in 10 who worked from home experienced domestic abuse, poll findsBureaucratic Britain has become addicted to permanent failureTop Foreign Office civil servant who was on holiday during fall of Kabul ‘should resign’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dont rush ban conversion therapy","story":"There is a public consultation closing on Friday that, should some of its recommendations be poorly implemented in law, would have damaging consequences for children.It could create a situation whereby doctors, counsellors and therapists would be deterred from exploring with a child any feelings of gender dysphoria – discomfort with their sexed body – for fear that they will be accused of trying to “change” the child’s identity and potentially being dragged through the criminal justice system.It could require parents to simply affirm a child’s assertion that they are “trans” since not to do so would be interpreted as “conversion therapy”. It could make it illegal to try to help a son or daughter accept their body as it is rather than pursue a pathway to puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgery. It risks erasing the possibility for children to be different, to not conform to stereotypes and to work through their emotional turmoil. Instead of helping children deal with the fact that sometimes things can’t be easily resolved – that it’s possible to be a feminine boy or a masculine girl – the law could increase the pressure towards a more rigid choice.It ignores the fact that most children presenting with gender dysphoria find it resolves as adults. And it may shut down exploration of why there has been such a huge rise in the number of children who have concerns about their gender, why two thirds are girls, the prevalence of autism, or why gender dysphoria is particularly common among children who go on to become gay or lesbian adults.The proposed law follows a campaign by Stonewall to extend a ban on conversion therapy for sexual orientation, on which there is near universal agreement, to cover talking therapies that intend to change a person from being transgender. That sounds simple, but it conceals huge complexity, particularly as it relates to children.It requires the Government to define what it means to be a transgender child, as opposed to a child suffering from gender dysphoria. As there is no objective test, it moves the Government into accepting the principle of self-identification. Is the bar the assertion by a girl that she is a boy, or vice-versa? How long must they hold this belief? At what stage does legitimate therapy or conversations that seek to explore what might underpin a child’s assertion that they are in the wrong body become vulnerable to accusations that the intent was to change a transgender child?The legal defence is that there must be an “intention” to change the person to or from being transgender, and that the Government wishes to preserve talking therapies that support those who are “questioning their LGBT status”. But how do you define in law “questioning”? Is it compatible with a firm assertion “I am trans”? How does the Government take into account the risk of a chilling effect, where legitimate clinicians withdraw from providing support because they do not want to risk being dragged through the courts? What of freedom of belief and speech? Many people would argue passionately you cannot be born in the wrong body. They are currently free to express what they believe to be the case. But if gender identity is “how you feel”, and your feelings are altered by hearing others’ arguments, have you been subjected to conversion therapy?These issues are so complex and sensitive, you’d be forgiven for thinking the Government will approach the drafting of the legislation with care. That it would wait for the NHS’s Cass Review, which will set out a definition of good care for children with gender dysphoria. Yet the opposite is true. The Government has promised a draft bill for spring 2022. Only six weeks have been allowed for the consultation, two months to analyse the responses and make policy decisions, and a handful of weeks to draft the Bill.As director of legislative affairs for two prime ministers, I know there are times you have to work fast to get a bill on to the statute books, but there’s no deadline for this legislation. Nor does taking a little more time leave anyone vulnerable: the vast majority of activities considered conversion therapy are already prohibited. Those rushing to show progress for the “Safe to be Me” conference need to recognise that it will last only a few days, but the Act will be on the statute book for years and the Bill will take months to progress through Parliament.Lobby groups will also seek to amend the Bill to achieve other objectives. These could include lowering the age for cross-sex hormones and making puberty blocking drugs more readily available. If the Bill offers a definition of being transgender, alternative, more expansive, definitions could be proposed, potentially with the intention of amending the Equality Act, or the Gender Recognition Act.The Government must slow down. At the very least arrange pre-legislative scrutiny in a Joint Committee. It can go through the draft Bill, seek further evidence, test the policy, and make suggestions. It will help build consensus.Nikki da Costa is a former head of legislative affairs at No 10 Downing StreetMore from NewsChristmas work from home order being drawn up by GovernmentGhislaine Maxwell trial: Accuser Carolyn \u0026#39was paid $300 to massage Jeffrey Epstein age 14\u0026#39One in 10 who worked from home experienced domestic abuse, poll findsBureaucratic Britain has become addicted to permanent failureTop Foreign Office civil servant who was on holiday during fall of Kabul ‘should resign’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hong kong visa scheme immigration policy done right","story":"In one swift legislative move at the start of this year, Britain opened up a pathway to citizenship for 5.4 million people. We should not underrate the generosity of this country’s decision to stand by its obligations to Hong Kong. Yet you may have scarcely heard about it since, and that is because one of the largest changes to British immigration law in recent history has been so smooth that it is almost underwhelming.Recent history tells us that it is notoriously hard to predict the number of people who plan to take up newfound rights to migrate. Yet the Government’s predictions on Hong Kongers have proven reliable. Whitehall’s central estimate was that 120,000 would apply for the British National Overseas (BNO) visa in the first year. By the end of September, 89,200 had applied.On the prediction of a £2.6 billion fiscal benefit too, the Government seems to have gotten hold of the right end of the stick. The University of Oxford\u0027s first large-scale survey of BNOs showed that those who have considered moving to the UK are younger, have higher educational qualifications, a higher employment rate and are generally wealthier than those who plan to stay in Hong Kong. They are dissatisfied with Hong Kong’s political environment and attracted by the prospect of freedom and the rule of law. Many have been impressed by what we have offered and galvanised by the speed of processing by the Home Office. Around 70,000 have already seen their applications approved.With little fanfare, they have settled across the United Kingdom. One group has set up bed and breakfasts in Blackpool many families have moved to Birmingham and the outskirts of Manchester others to York. Local community organisations, as well as fellow Hong Kongers, have been effective at providing support, language lessons and advice to help new arrivals settle in.There are still a few things to be ironed out. A large number of 18-25 year old Hong Kongers — which is the age group most likely to be targeted by the crackdown — are ineligible for the scheme, often when they are dependent on parents with BNO status who may not be ready to move. Some of these young people are stuck in the asylum process, despite having a case as clear as day, and the most eagerness to get on and work. That is why a cross-party group of MPs has tabled an amendment to the Nationality and Borders Bill, which is being debated this week, to extend the scheme to anyone who has one parent with BNO status. There is also the question of how we can protect them from harassment, for many remain nervous about being targeted by supporters of the Chinese Communist Party despite being 5,000 miles away from Beijing. In Hong Kong, CCP-friendly newspapers and politicians have stoked disinformation about citizenship and intolerance in Britain. The police must take these threats seriously. Still, the broad picture remains very positive. Britain is showing the world that it can still provide a safe haven for those who have been persecuted abroad. We have lived up both to our obligations to Hong Kong and to our history of opening our arms to refugees. It is something of which we can be incredibly proud.More from NewsChristmas work from home order being drawn up by GovernmentGhislaine Maxwell trial: Accuser Carolyn \u0026#39was paid $300 to massage Jeffrey Epstein age 14\u0026#39One in 10 who worked from home experienced domestic abuse, poll findsBureaucratic Britain has become addicted to permanent failureTop Foreign Office civil servant who was on holiday during fall of Kabul ‘should resign’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"phileas fogg represented best victorian derring do","story":"Has David Tennant really got the measure of Phileas Fogg? Tennant, who plays Jules Verne’s globetrotting hero in the new BBC dramatisation of Around the World in 80 Days, describes Fogg as “a particularly stuffy Englishman” who “represents everything that’s alarming and peculiar about that old sense of British Empire”.To start with, I’d question the stuffiness. I concede that Verne’s 1872 novel begins with Fogg, a man who lives by rigid routines, dismissing his manservant because he “has brought him shaving-water at 84 degrees Fahrenheit instead of 86”. But Verne describes his behaviour as “eccentric”. Fogg’s extreme standards stem from his unusually precise, mathematical way of thinking – the very opposite of stuffiness, which is all about following convention.Besides, Fogg soon abandons his comfortable routines once he embarks on his journey. What’s stuffy about dropping everything and circumnavigating the globe for a bet?Neither is Fogg a tub-thumping reactionary. He is, famously, a member of the Reform Club – perhaps not a guarantee of un-stuffiness nowadays, but in the Victorian era a sign that you were committed to radical politics. One doesn’t have the sense from Tennant’s remarks that he realises Fogg belonged to a club that banned copies of the Daily  from its premises.But Fogg is no racist. Indeed, he ends the novel engaged to Aouda, the Indian woman he rescues from being burned alive in a suttee ritual.In the end, a chap who travels around sorting out other people’s problems is an eternally appealing figure in the adventure genre – as former Doctor Who David Tennant would no doubt concede.Fogg belongs in the pantheon of the great fictional travellers who flourished during the second half of the 19th century – a golden age for adventure writing. Figures such as the heroes in G A Henty’s stories for boys, or Allan Quatermain in the novels of H Rider Haggard, were plucky and venturesome – they cast themselves into unknown and probably hostile territory to challenge themselves, not for gain.The “civilising” of Africans is anathema to men like Quatermain, who envies them for knowing “nothing about steam, electricity, or gunpowder, and mercifully for themselves nothing about printing and the penny post” he also rails against the enslavement and exploitation of Africans by white men.Robert Louis Stevenson, defending the adventure novel from attacks by Henry James and others, observed in 1884 that the genre “appeals to certain almost sensual and quite illogical tendencies in man” – that is, the counterintuitive desire, in an increasingly civilised world, to experience a little danger and discomfort.If the Tennant series focuses on Fogg as a hidebound imperialist lackey instead of trying to capture that spirit of romantic freedom, it will be a sorry thing.More from NewsChristmas work from home order being drawn up by GovernmentGhislaine Maxwell trial: Accuser Carolyn \u0026#39was paid $300 to massage Jeffrey Epstein age 14\u0026#39One in 10 who worked from home experienced domestic abuse, poll findsBureaucratic Britain has become addicted to permanent failureTop Foreign Office civil servant who was on holiday during fall of Kabul ‘should resign’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"progressive alliance would prolong lefts delusions","story":"It’s an old joke so forgive me if you’ve heard it before: a Labour activist is walking along a clifftop path when he sees two people – a Conservative and a Liberal Democrat – clinging to the edge for dear life. So which one does he kick off first? The Tory, of course. Business before pleasure.Those of a less political nature will scratch their heads in bewilderment at the age-old rivalry – or perhaps hatred is a more appropriate word – between the two Left-of-centre opposition parties. After all, they want many of the same things: fairer taxes, fairer industrial policy, fairer foreign policy, fairer housing, a fairer economy, a fairer voting system…Ok, you can scratch that last one, which has long been a bone of contention between Labour and the Lib Dems. But the one thing they do have in common is a desire to rid the country of this Conservative government. The problem then arises: and replace it with what?A week on Thursday voters in North Shropshire will go to the polls to elect a replacement for disgraced former cabinet minister Owen Paterson. It’s one of those classic battlegrounds at which the Lib Dems have historically gained advantage by being the less hated of the three main options. Following the traditional post-election period in which Left-leaning columnists call for a “progressive alliance” to remove the Conservatives from office, the Lib Dems have intensified their demands that Labour voters in North Shropshire switch their support to them. This is a bold strategy for a party that last finished as runner-up in the seat in 2010 and who have been soundly beaten by Labour in every general election there since. But perception is everything and Ed Davey’s party will have been bolstered in its efforts to seize the progressive standard by a peculiar editorial in this morning’s  suggesting the Lib Dems are indeed more likely to win than Labour. In by-elections, parties’ internal polling is every bit as valuable as Monopoly £500 notes, but it’s worth noting that both Labour and the Lib Dems have produced “surveys” of voters – presumably in radically different parts of the constituency – showing them to be within reach of victory. Both opposition parties desperately need the morale boost victory would bestow. But why is such a progressive alliance so difficult to attain?The elephant in the room is, of course, the 2010-2015 coalition government. Davey himself, it will never be forgotten, served as a cabinet minister in David Cameron’s administration the same one that implemented austerity, cut services and trebled university tuition fees – a reform the Lib Dems strenuously opposed during the general election campaign, then enthusiastically voted for after it had ended. In time the Lib Dems may well shake off their reputation as the Conservatives’ little helpers, but that task is all the greater when the coalition’s former climate change secretary is leading it.The fact is that Lib Dems provide the main opposition to Labour in hundreds of local areas across the country. Labour MPs in particular are familiar with the party’s cynical (but effective) campaign tactics that have so frequently left Labour in its wake. And although the Parliamentary Labour Party is now greatly depleted, there are enough older MPs still around who recall the vehemence with which the Lib Dems opposed many parts of the last Labour government’s agenda, right up until the point where they went into partnership with the Conservatives.Talk of an alliance, therefore, is fanciful. And proponents are demanding it at exactly the wrong time, when Labour has started to make serious, though modest, progress in the polls. The time to make the case for an anti-Conservative alliance is when the government is popular and is looking unbeatable. Now, when Keir Starmer looks like he might actually make the next election competitive, is not that time.From Labour’s point of view, stepping aside for the sake of the Lib Dems, even if such an arrangement falls short of a formal electoral pact, holds very few benefits. If North Shropshire were to fall to either of the opposition parties, it would not be a huge surprise, given the circumstances in which it was called. When Government ministers and backbench MPs appear on the following morning’s radio and TV bulletins to explain why the party lost, no one is going to accuse them of spin. Indeed, a Tory victory – still an outside possibility – could accurately be depicted as an astonishing victory, so poor were the party’s prospects at the start of the campaign.So what would Labour gain from a Lib Dem win? Nothing whatever, except a short-lived blip in the polls for a rival party.The challenge facing Labour is the same as it has always been, whatever optimistic scenarios of “progressive alliances” dominate the fantasies of anti-Conservative commentators: how to win an election in its own right. Yearning after a shortcut to victory, either through an electoral alliance or via electoral reform, is simply a deflection strategy that allows the Left to focus on tactics rather than to make the hard choices about how to change enough so that they attract the support of previously reluctant voters.Labour needs to go all out for victory in North Shropshire and everywhere else, treating every other party – whether the Lib Dems, the Greens or the Scottish nationalists – as as much of an opponent as the Conservatives themselves. Because if they ever get back into government, they will find – as they did between 1997 and 2010 – that so-called parties of the Left will be as supportive of a Labour government as the Conservatives will be.More from NewsChristmas work from home order being drawn up by GovernmentGhislaine Maxwell trial: Accuser Carolyn \u0026#39was paid $300 to massage Jeffrey Epstein age 14\u0026#39One in 10 who worked from home experienced domestic abuse, poll findsBureaucratic Britain has become addicted to permanent failureTop Foreign Office civil servant who was on holiday during fall of Kabul ‘should resign’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stonehenge sea unveiled british museum","story":"A “Stonehenge of the sea” is to be displayed at the British Museum, as part of the first major exhibition on its more familiar contemporary.Seahenge, as it is known, consists of an oak tree’s upturned roots surrounded by 54 wooden posts that would have been nearly 10 feet tall, arranged in a 21-foot diameter circle.The exact purpose of the henge and its flipped over stump is unclear, although there has been some speculation that it may have been used to lay bodies on, with scavenger birds able to feast on the flesh of the dead.“If Stonehenge is one of the world’s most remarkable surviving ancient stone circles, then Seahenge is the equivalent in timber,” said Dr Jennifer Wexler, the project curator of the exhibition, adding that it is “still relatively unknown”.The henge is also known as Holme I, after the village of Holme-next-the-Sea where it was discovered by an amateur archaeologist in 1998.Having initially found a Bronze Age axe head, John Lorimer made repeated visits to the beach, eventually uncovering the tree stump and calling in professional archaeologists from Norfolk Castle Museum.Amid controversy and protests, in particular from self-styled modern-day druids with didgeridoos, the full henge was excavated and removed from its original site.Exposure to oxygen and saltwater risked rapid deterioration of the wood, which had spent four millennia encased in peat.It was transferred to the Mary Rose Trust in Portsmouth, which specialises in preserving waterlogged timber, and was stabilised before going on display at the Lynn Museum in King’s Lynn.The henge has never gone on loan before, with Dr Neil Wilkin, the curator of the exhibition, saying that the museum was surprised their request was accepted.Much of the 4,000-year-old construction’s origins and purpose are still unknown to researchers, but they are certain that it held spiritual significance, with the doorway to the circle aligned with the midsummer sun.Visitors to the exhibition, which runs from February 17 to July 17, will be able to pass through that doorway themselves.Seahenge\u0027s more well-known stone equivalent sits on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire and has long fascinated experts and the public alike. It is believed to have been built over several centuries, somewhere around 3,000 BC to 2,000 BC.While some have speculated that Stonehenge may have been used for healing or for studying the cosmos, a more widely held theory is that it formed the culmination of a funerary procession from the River Avon.Stonehenge and Seahenge are two of just 120 known henges in Britain, while there are over 1,000 stone circles which are more likely to survive the country\u0027s harsh weather conditions than their timber counterparts.The Seahenge timbers are among over 430 objects brought together from across the UK and Europe for what will be the British Museum’s largest exhibition for several years.The curators hope to dispel the idea that the creators of Stonehenge existed in an isolated and primitive society. The loans and items from the museum’s own collection come from across Europe, including France, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal and display the rich cultural world and networks of exchange within which neolithic Britons existed.The majority have not been seen in the UK before.“We think of Stonehenge as an English and a British monument. But actually, when you start to look at it, the tentacles of the root systems reach out across Britain and across Europe,” said Dr Wilkin. Also among the items displayed will be two remarkable cone-shaped gold hats, resembling those of a wizard, and the full Bush Barrow Hoard from the Wiltshire Museum which includes the finest example of Bronze Age gold craftsmanship ever found in Britain.More from NewsChristmas work from home order being drawn up by GovernmentGhislaine Maxwell trial: Accuser Carolyn \u0026#39was paid $300 to massage Jeffrey Epstein age 14\u0026#39One in 10 who worked from home experienced domestic abuse, poll findsBureaucratic Britain has become addicted to permanent failureTop Foreign Office civil servant who was on holiday during fall of Kabul ‘should resign’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"david cameron refuses say hed","story":"Exclusive: David Cameron refuses to sayhed attend Grenfell inquiry after ridiculing rulesEXCLUSIVE: Returning red-faced from a morning spot of tennis at a local club, Mr Cameron repeatedly said “morning” to the Mirror but would not answer our questions on the inquiryFormer PM David Cameron leaves his Notting Hill home Image: TIM ANDERSONByMatthew Young:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | commentsDavid Cameron this morning refused to say whether he would attend the Grenfell Tower inquirycalled upon. It came after Michael Mansfield QC, a lawyer for the bereaved and survivors of the tragedy, yesterday said the former Tory PM should be called to answer questions at the probe into the June  fire, which killed  people. Mr Cameron said in  how he wanted to “scrap health and safety rules that put people off”, the inquiry heard on Monday. The following year he disparaged the “shadow” of health and safety, saying: “Britannia didn’t rule the waves with armbands on.” Mr Mansfield said Cameron ridiculed health and safety rules “relegating citizens…to effectively a bonfire”. Mr Cameron was being referred to by lawyers as they described more than  years of cover ups of the extent of the cladding crisis that led to the blaze. But the former PM, , refused to say this morning whether he would attend the inquirycalled upon. Returning red-faced from a morning spot of tennis at a local club, Mr Cameron repeatedly said “morning” to the Mirror but would not answer our questions on the inquiry or whether he would attend. He entered his plush Notting Hill home - which lies just one mile from Grenfell Tower - and slammed the door shut. In response to the claims made in the inquiry Mr Cameron’s spokesman said he was for “a sensible approach to health and safety [rules] to ensure they protected people and were applied where needed rather than unnecessarily overwhelm businesses with red tape”.Do you think David Cameron should face the inquiry  Join the debate in the comments below The previously inquiry heard how the government acknowledged that a rule against introducing new regulations for the building industry in the s put it in breach of its duty to protect the right to le. The hearing heard the government suppressed information about the combustibility of cladding used on Lakanal House after a fire killed six people in  in Camberwell, south east London. It noted the need to “avoid giving the impression that we believe all buildings of this constructioninherently unsafe”. The investigation into this fire was shut down by officials in a “grotesque abdication of responsibility” which “raises the spectre of a deliberate cover up”, the inqury was told.  After Lakanal, despite the government outwardly promising to implement the coroner’s recommendation to encourage the use of sprinklers, civil servants wrote that it was simply acting “to be able to say that DCLG is taking action”. A senior civil servant warned in May  – just a month before the Grenfell Tower fire – that “we or ministers are increasingly vulnerable to some or all of these risks becoming material andbeing held to account for being inactive”.

The former minister informed her constituents that she intended to step back after nearly  years in Parliament. Ms Harman, , is known as the aposMother of the Houseapos as Britainaposs longest serving female MP, first joining the Commons as MP for Camberwell and Peckham in .In an email to constituents, she said: I feel I can leave the House of Commons now confident that Labour is gaining strength under the leadership of Keir Starmer and the new team he has appointed.It has been an overwhelming honour to be Member of Parliament representing and working for the people of Camberwell and Peckham for nearly  years.  Ms Harman has served as acting Labour leader and deputy leader, as well as holding several Government roles over her long career. A veteran feminist campaigner, she held the post of Secretary of State for Social Security and became the first Minister for Women. She also served as a Justice Minister, Leader of the House of Commons and Solicitor General. Ms Harman said: I entered the Commons as one of only  Labour women MPs in a parliament that was % men. Now there are  Labour women and across all parties women MPs are a “critical mass.” But there remains much more to be done till women genuinely share political power with men on equal terms and until women in this country are equal. I will leave the House of Commons with my feminism, my belief in Labour and my enthusiasm for politics undimmed. She added: When I was elected in  I promised the voters I would serve as their MP with dedication and energy till the next election and I will do that, remaining active and diligent both locally and in the Commons. Labour leader Keir Starmer led tributes to Ms Harman, who he said had paved the way for future generations. Harriet, your commitment to Labour and Camberwell and Peckham for almost  years is phenomenal, he said. A champion for women and social justice - youaposve paved the way for future generations. Itaposs been a privilege to work with you, I look forward to continuing to do so for a while yet.  Ed Miliband, who led the party with Ms Harman as his deputy between  and , described her as a feminist, fighter, conviction politician.

Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell described her a trail-blazer for women. Sheaposs incredibly effective, very loyal, fierce, formidable and very kind. She taught me so much, she said. And London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: My friend Harriet has given the people of Camberwell and Peckham, the Labour movement and our country a letime of outstanding service. This news is a loss to many.

He recalled feeling frustrated as a teen because of his undiagnosed dyslexia. Image: PAByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Dec | commentsMatt Hancock has called for the introduction of dyslexia screening at primary schools to break the link with the learning dficulty and crime. The ex-Health Secretary told MPs  per cent of young people slip through the cracks and head into the world of work without being diagnosed. There are correlations between dyslexia and unemployment, drug usage, school exclusions and homelessness, he told MPs and highlighted more than half of the prison population are dyslexic. These are the knock on effects of undiagnosed dyslexia, and we have the tools to solve this injustice. Introducing his Dyslexia Screening Bill, he said Iaposm proud to be dyslexic, but admitted it wasnapost always that way.  As a teenager, I didnapost know I was dyslexic. I spent my school years focusing on maths and science subjects, always trying to avoid anything that needed more than a few sentences. He recalled the light bulb moment he experienced once he was told of his learning dficulty. Mr Hancock was not diagnosed with dyslexia until he went to Oxford University aged . “I was one of the lucky ones who was caught. There are too many children who are not caught early enough. It is a quiet scandal that an estimated four-in-five dyslexic children leave school with their dyslexia unidentied, he told MPs. He told the Commons it is a quiet scandal that some young people have their potential unrealised and often their confidence undermined because they are unaware of their condition. Mr Hancock told MPs specialist teachers who had training to spot the learning dficulty, alongside cheap and essay computer-based screening tools” would help many young people. Mr Hancock’s Dyslexia Screening Bill received support from a cross-party group of MPs, but is unlikely to become law without Government backing. The former Health Secretary who was a key face during the Covid pandemic quit his Cabinet position after CCTV footage surfaced, showing him breaching social distancing rules, kissing his aide in his Whitehall office. He told ITVaposs Peston show he is in no rush to get back into Government and is enjoying sitting on the back benches.“Itaposs a very important job and I think contributions from people who’ve been there in the heat of the battle [like] Mark [Harper] as chief whip... or Theresa May – the contributions she makes as former prime minister – andI can make that sort of contribution in the House of Commons then I’ll enjoy doing it.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CabinetHouse of CommonsSchoolsPoliticsHomelessness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Officials can be heard laughing about cheese and wine as Boris Johnsonaposs former spokeswoman Allegra Stratton cracked jokes about a business meeting in which there was “definitely no social distancing.” The recording, passed to ITV News, is of a rehearsal on December  for planned daily TV media briefings, which Ms Stratton was supposed to be the face of but the Prime Minister later scrapped. Staff in the  Downing Street press room can be heard pretending to ask questions about a party. Boris Johnson has faced calls to resignreports of the party are true, while Labour leader Keir Starmer said he must come clean about it. Ed Oldfield, adviser to the PM, said: “I’ve just seen reports on Twitter that there was a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night, do you recognise those reports ”  “I went home”, replies Ms Stratton, who appears to crease up laughing before telling colleagues hold on. Following a long pause, Mr Oldfield goes on: “Would the prime minister condone having a Christmas party ” Ms Stratton laughs and says “what’s the answer  before her colleagues step in to help her compose an answer. “It wasn’t a party, it was cheese and wine”, offers one. “Is cheese and wine alright ” Ms Stratton asks, before adding, again laughing “it was a business meeting”. She then warns those present “this is recorded” and says “this fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.”  Downing Street has denied there was a party and, when asked himself, the Prime Minister said he had been assured guidance was followed. It comes after the Daily Mirror revealed bombshell allegations that revellers at an unofficial No Christmas bash on December  allegedly enjoyed food, drinks and games which went on well past midnight. Fresh allegations in the Times also revealed that officials organised a apossecret Santaapos and sent out invites, suggesting the event was planned. Millions of people were living under strict Covid rules at the time - with London under Tier  restrictions.  The following day Mr Johnson announced that Christmas plans had to be drastically scaled back. Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, said: “People across the country followed the rules even when that meant being separated from their families, locked down and - tragically for many - unable to say goodbye to their loved ones. “They had a right to expect that the government was doing the same. To lie and to laugh about those lies is shameful. “The Prime Minister now needs to come clean, and apologise. It cannot be one rule for the Conservatives and another for everyone .”  The SNPaposs Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: This video is damning and leaves the Prime Minister with a lot to answer for. When every inidual up and down the country was told to stay at home in order to protect the NHS, the Tories were instead having a Christmas party which, as a senior staff member has now confirmed, was aposnot socially distancedapos.If this is true, then the Prime Ministeraposs position is untenable and he must remove himself from office immediately. Ms Stratton remains the Prime Ministeraposs spokeswoman on Cop and had previously worked as head of communications for Chancellor Rishi Sunak.The Chancellor was pressed on whether he or any of his special advisers had attended the Christmas parties in Downing Street last year.He told MPs: No, I did not attend any parties.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonPoliticsChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So where’s MY choice It is estimated by a charity that , children have long CovidImage: Getty Images iStockphotoopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Dec | commentsAt first it seemed sensible. Then insulting. Now  Scandalously negligent. Primary school age children in this country currently have the highest infection rates they’ve ever had during the pandemic - but there are no plans to start vaccinating them. Nearly five million - year olds have been jabbed in America, on Sunday the scheme was approved in Australia, and the rollout is expected to start next week in some European countries after it was given the green light by the European Medicines Agency. But here, nothing.Some parents won’t want their kids to be vaccinated of course, and that’s their choice - but I do, desperately. So where’s MY choice I’d take my seven-year-old to a back street illegal vaccinatorsuch a thing existed, but unfortunately it doesn’t.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Omicron is only just getting started, and already a whopping , kids tested positive for covid last week, with actual infection levels estimated to be up to four times higher than that. Charity Long Covid Kids reports that , children currently have long covid - , of whom have been suffering with it for over a year.Respected epidemiologist and public health researcher Deepti Gurdasani puts it simply, “Infection of children with SARS-Cov- will be one of those actions we look back at in history and wonder how on earth it was allowed to happen - by those who should’ve been protecting them.” I’ve gratefully accepted every vaccine my son has been offered, starting when he was eight weeks old. I’m lucky to live in a country where they’re available as standard, for free. And I believe it’s my duty to ensure he’s up to date with them, in accordance with the No part of parenting: trying to keep your kid safe. Also of course in this case, where coronavirus is still circulating, jabbing everyone means the whole community is protected. It’s better for everyone. The news about Omicron is becoming ever more concerning, and there were already upwards of , Covid cases a day before it reared its unwelcome head. And yet, every morning, I deliver my son into an environment where he mixes freely with hundreds of others, with no mitigations. No masks, no bubbles, no ventilation. And no vaccine either. Best of British luck, eh, kid  Vaccinating children was approved in the US at the end of October. Prof Jon Levy, chairman of the Department of Environmental Health at Boston University, welcomed the news: “Every paediatrician I know is eager to get their own kids age - vaccinated immediately. “They plan to get as many kids vaccinated in their offices as quickly as possible. If that doesn’t tell you how safe and effective the vaccine is. I don’t know what will.” If the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation know something we don’t – and have good reason why they’re dragging their feet on protecting the smallest, most helpless people in our communities – they need to speak up. Otherwise, they’re forcing us to fail our children.

He revealed that he was on leave from August  and did notuntil August , some  days after the Afghan government collapsed.He told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee: “If I had my time again I would have come back from my leave earlier than I did.” Sir Philip was criticised by MPs for failing to come back from holidays to deal with the crisis.He even chose to remain on holiday after then-Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab jetted home from a luxury break in Crete.Conservative MP Alicia Kearns told Sir Philip: I donapost think it is enough to say, aposmea culpaapos. How in two weeks did at no point, you go, aposI canapost, I have to go in and protect my people’ ”  The civil servant said cover arrangements were in place and he stayed in touch with the department all the way through the period. He also defended ordering crisis centre workers to stick to eight-hour shts - despite a “monumental volume” of emails from desperate Afghans and Britons hoping to flee. Tory MP Bob Seely said: “People clocking off after eight hours, not bothering to come in at weekends - it’s all complacent and wooly and waffly and unfocused and sort of just a bit rubbish.” But Sir Philip hit back: “There isn’t a clocking off culture at all … when we’re in a full blown crisis it’s very intense. “We have an eight-hour sht system and we make sure therefore that people are getting a period of rest and then coming back onto shts.” MPs also heard explosive claims from Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office during Operation Pitting and who branded the ministry’s response to the Afghan crisis dysal and chaotic. Allied forces withdrew as Taliban fighters advanced - sparking a refugee emergency as worried Afghans tried to flee Mr Marshall claimed just % of Afghan nationals who applied to leave under one UK scheme received help. Some were murdered after being left in Kabul after the Taliban swept to power, he alleged in written evidence to the committee. Meanwhile, a row broke out over claims the PM intervened to order the rescue of animals from Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover. Sir Philip insisted there was was no prioritisation of animals in the evacuation from Kabul, after a whistleblower claimed Boris Johnson issued an instruction to save animals from the Nowzad shelter during the evacuation effort.Whistleblower Mr Marshall accused Mr Johnson of issuing an instruction to save animals from the Nowzad shelter - potentially putting British troopsapos lives at risk and preventing people from fleeing Kabul. He told MPs there was an instruction from the Prime Minister to use considerable capacity to transport Nowzadaposs animals. Mr Johnson branded the claim complete nonsense and Downing Street said it was entirely untrue. Former Royal Marine Paul Pen Farthing, who ran the shelter, launched a high-profile campaign to get his staff and animals out, using a plane funded through donations. The Government sponsored clearance for the charter flight - triggering allegations animals had been prioritised over people. It has previously been claimed the PM’s we Carrie also intervened to ensure the animals were transported to the UK. But Mr Johnson’s spokesman said neither the Prime Minister nor Mrs Johnson were involved. Yet campaigner Dominic Dyer insisted he had called on the Johnsons for help.I forced the Prime Ministeraposs arm, I think all of us behind this campaign did,” he told the BBC. The next day, the senior commander in the Ministry of Defence, in the Air Force department, contacted me and said you can have your flight authorisation and we could get that plane down on the ground into Afghanistan.“Thataposs my proof because without the intervention from the Prime Minister,would have continued to block the operation. Labour leader Keir Starmer said of Mr Marshall’s evidence: “This is a devastating testimony that lays bare the shambolic incompetence of the Government in protecting thousands of Afghans to whom we owed a duty.”Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonBen WallaceLabour PartyConservative PartyTalibanForeign OfficeAir ForceBBCMinistry of DefenceCivil servantsPublic servicesPoliticsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Government is not expected to back Labour MP John Spellar’s bid to introduce legislation when his Private Member’s Bill s to the Commons on Friday. During a recent meeting with Environment Minister Lord Zac Goldsmith, a leading campaigner was told the department “hoped” the Government’s own Bill would be brought to Parliament “next spring or summer” - but there was no guarantee. The Tories pledged at the  election to ban hunters importing their spoils - including wild animals’ bodies, heads, skins and tusks - to Britain, but campaigners are frustrated at delays.  On Thursday, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Trophy Hunting will unveil a billboard poster outside Parliament to highlight the campaign to stop hunters bringing their sick souvenirs to the UK. The billboard will tour the country to raise awareness and urge people to contact their MPs to put more pressure on the government. However, supporters of a ban are hopeful the Government’s proposal will cover “virtually all animals” with “no exemptions or loopholes” and potential prison sentences for offenders. Outlawing the importation of hunting trophies would mark a victory for the Mirror, which has led the fight.  Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting founder Eduardo Goncalves said: “We’ve yet to see the details, but all the signs so far point to this being a very good Bill. “It appears that the scope includes virtually all species, offenders could face jail, and perhaps best of all it seems exemptions have been ruled out. “This could indeed be an historic moment. “Hats off to the Government for listening to voters, and to the Mirror and its readers who have kept up the pressure in order to make this ban a reality.” But he added: “The question that still remains is when is the Government going to bring this Bill to Parliament   “Ideally the Government should announce that at the same time as publishing the outline of the Bill. “If it can’t do this, then it should seriously consider adopting John Spellar’s Private Member’s Bill. Mr Spellar said: “These Government delays are ridiculous.  “The public and Parliament want to end this vile trade and so - they say - do Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party. “They just need to get a grip and get a move on - or even back my Bill on Friday.” Speaking in the Commons last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “We are going to introduce legislation this Parliament to ban the import of hunting trophies, and delivering the change that we promised.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyJohn SpellarZac GoldsmithPoliticsEnd trophy hunting importsTrophy Hunting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Harry Brinkworth, who is  today, received hundreds of birthday cards from well-wishers after children in his class turned down his birthday invitations.The youngster was left sobbing after classmates said apostheir parents did not like himapos and would not go to his party.Harryaposs mum Hannah Brinkworth, , decide to take to Instagram to try and cheer up her son after the cruel incident.She asked members of the public to send him a birthday card to make his birthday special. This morning Harry woke up to almost  cards from kind strangers across the world wishing him a great birthday, with possibly even more in the post.  Mum Hannah is also organising him a bowling birthday party after she was approach by other parents saying their children wanted to celebrate his th birthday with him. When asked what he thought of the hundreds of cards and messages that he had received, Harry said: It was the best birthday I have ever had. Hannah was initially upset by the way he was treated but has since been blown away by the response of complete strangers. She wanted to raise awareness of autism and to give her son something to make his birthday. Weaposre not doing it for any kind of pity party, and we donapost want people to buy or send expensive things, she added. Itaposs just a case of making people aware of it and making a little boyaposs day.Harry has been receiving the cards since December  when Hannah posted on Instagram with some coming from people as far away as New Zealand. He was so excited to read all the nice messages.Hannah said: It was special for him, and he enjoyed it - he just wanted to read every single one of them like a book.Everybody was referring to him as a superhero and saying that heaposd done such a positive thing.He had a card from Dubai and a card from Texas, and also one from somebody in Canada and New Zealand.All of the excitement made Harry very happy, but he also has understood the importance to be inclusive and kind towards others.Hannah said: He understands the bigger picture of it, and he knows why itaposs important and itaposs not just him.After today, the conversation will continue and so it should - thataposs the important part.With autism, people are almost scared to have the conversation and scared to bring it up, but we shouldnapost be - we should celebrate our kids regardless.Thereaposs been so many people reaching out and sharing similar experiences.Every birthday, Hannah tries to organise a birthday for Harry but none of the children every come.  She said that it is usually the parents and not the children who do not want to go, and that there needs to be a change in attitude in how parents talk about children who may have additional or special education needs.Hannah continued: Harry is autistic, and weaposve known for a long time, and heaposs not a bad kid in any way.He always wants birthday parties, but historically, every year we try to sort one and nobody comes.I mentioned to him that I needed to know what friends he wanted to come to his party so I could send invites.He said two names, but when I asked again he said they werenapost allowed to come.I said I didnapost understand, and he turned around and, at -years-old, said one had told him their mum doesnapost like him and they canapost play with him.She said: I found it absolutely baffling - itaposs not the kidsapos issue, itaposs the parentsapos lack of understanding about Harryaposs issues.Itaposs not discussed enough how parents talk about kids with additional needs or SEN issues, and they donapost understand the impact of what they say in front of their kids, which is then repeated - itaposs unacceptable.She added: The amount of people who have kids with autism or ADHD who have said similar things, it shows that itaposs not kids who are the issues, itaposs the grown-ups.

And after coming through gruelling treatment for a brain tumour, a call from Bear Grylls was the icing on the cake for the -year-old. Darshan said: “He’s been through so many le-threatening challenges so he could relate to me. Bear just said keep going, keep fighting and never give up.”Darshan’s wish for gym kit was granted by charity Make-A-Wish UK, backed by the Mirror Christmas Appeal. He says: “It’s been amazing what they’ve been able to do. “It’s really made me happy and it’s one of the things that got me through my treatments, it was one thing I thought about – ‘ I get through this, I’ll get my wish’.” It was just over four-and-a-half years ago that the youngster from Berkhamsted, Herts, was told he had a brain tumour, at the age of nine.  Darshan says: “I feel like I lost part of my childhood – I couldn’t have fun because I was constantly in hospital. It was impossible to be happy.” Mum Samreen, , said: “Because the tumour was in the thalamus, right in the middle of the brain, taking a biopsy or doing any intervention to try to release the fluid in his brain was very high risk. The process was awful.” By Jason Beattie For the majority of families this Christmas will be a joyous time of presents, food and fun. But for some children the festive season will be very dferent. Across the country there are more than , young people who are critically ill. Many will be spending what should be a special time of the year in hospital. Others will have to have treatment, scans or blood tests. With your help we can give them a Christmas that they will always remember. This year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal is raising funds for Make-A-Wish UK that helps seriously ill young people make their dreams come true.It could be they want to meet their hero or heroine or feed an animal at the zoo or travel to see Santa in Lapland. The money raised could help Joshua, six, who has severe epilepsy, achieve his wish of a bedroom makeover or Summer, also six, who has acute leukaemia and dreams of a bouncy castle. Each year Make-A-Wish helps hundreds of critically ill children achieve their letime’s ambition. But to make a wish come true takes an army of volunteers, supporters and donors. That’s why every penny you donate could make a dference. Granting a wish can transform a child’s le. It gives them something to look forward to. For others it provides a special memory which makes the treatment they need more bearable.It can also help their parents who, despite doing everything they can for their sick child, feel it is not enough. Jason Suckley, Make-A-Wish UK chief executive, said: “I met the family of a boy who was recovering from brain surgery. “His grandmother told me how dficult it had been for her to watch her daughter struggle with the challenges of her son’s condition.But while they were enjoying his wish together, her daughter turned to her and said, ‘There is still magic in this world isn’t there mum ’ . “That’s just one instance that illustrates how the power of a wish lies in sharing positive memories with loved ones. “Every donation from Mirror readers will help us create those memories – bringing joy to ill children and their families during the darkest of times.” Samreen and marketing exec dad Fraser, , consulted experts and decided proton beam therapy in the US was the way to go – but it cost more than £,. A plea for government funding was turned down, so they raised it themselves by remortgaging their home and setting up a Go Fund Me page. After chemotherapy in the UK they went to Boston for the beam therapy and radiotherapy, and by October  Darshan was cancer-free.

James Stokoe, , was murdered in front of his four-year-old son, Harry, when he was stabbed to death by a complete stranger. Alexander Layton, , was jailed for le with a minimum -year term as Jamesapos family spoke of their aposunimaginableapos loss. The two men had a row when Mr Stokoe had to brake suddenly as Layton crossed Trenchard Avenue in Thornaby, Teesside on May  last year. Layton was captured on CCTV and Dashcam by passing motorists when he plunged the in kitchen kne six times into Mr Stokoe as Harry sat in a car seat in the back of the BMW.  Peter Makepeace QC, prosecuting, told Teesside crown court there were several aggravating factors in the case, including the impact of the crime on Harry at such a young age. The offence was committed in the presence of the victimaposs four-year-old son, he said. In the victim impact statement of his mother Alex Stokoe, she told of her sonaposs inability to stay in the car as it drives down Trenchard Avenue because he had so many memories of the traumatic events.  Harry is also fearfulanyone approaches an open window of a car, the court heard. Heartbroken mum Alex, a university lab technician, watched proceedings via a video link as she felt unable to attend in person, Mr Makepeace said. Instead, he read out her moving victim impact statement. She wrote: James will be remembered and loved as long as I breathe. Our son will always know what a wonderful father James was and how much he loved him.  She told how she was a single mother at , not because she chose to be, but because her husband had been apostorn away from usapos. She said: I will never be able to accept referring to James in the past tense. He should be here. Explaining to her son that his dad aposwould not be coming home againapos was the most painful moment of her le, she added. She said: A child should not be frightened when the car window is open in case someone comes to hurt them.  I now face le as a -year-old widow. I have lost not just my husband but my best friend and soulmate, he was everything to me. To tell your four-year-old that his daddy is dead and wonapost be coming home is truly the most horrendous, painful moment of my le. To know your child has seen things that no child should ever have to see or hear. To explain the process of death and how James died. Funeral, cremation the finality of it all, so our son could understand what was happening around him. Harry accepts as much as a child of that age can, that his daddy is dead, that he isnapost coming back. She told Layton: Harry has needed therapy because of the trauma that you have caused. In a heart-rending testimony, Jamesapos mother Doreen told how she had lost her only child. Her world had been changed forever on the day she lost her aposamazingapos son, who loved his family with all his heart, aposhis hopes and dreams for the future never to be realisedapos. Sentencing Layton to le imprisonment, His Honour Judge Howard Crowson said he had inflicted eight serious injuries to his victim as he sat in the front seat of his car, unable to defend himself. James Stokoe was a happy, successful husband, father and son, he added. His four-year-old son was in the rear of the car...and is still in fear of another attack. Layton had a history of violence, including attacks on his own mother.Temporary Det Supt Helen Barker of Cleveland Police said after the case: This was a shocking incident which occurred in the presence of Jamesapos young son, which will undoubtedly have had a huge effect on him.The death of James has had a traumatic impact on his whole family. James was a much loved dad to his little boy and was married in the Dominican Republic. The popular graduate of Teesside University was a keen footballer, a motorbike enthusiast and worked in the motor industry. At the time of his death, friends paid tribute to a gentle giant who was affectionately known as Big Red.

Olcan Wilkes, seven, may have months to live after developing aplastic anaemia, and no current donor match available for his bone tissue type. His parents Sam and Genevieve, both , of Newent, Glos, are urging everyone to register as a donor and give their boy and others a chance. On average, % of patients with the ­condition die within a year unless a transplant is undertaken. Dad Sam said: “We need to find a bone marrow match, that’s the only cure.” Olcan is having two or three platelet transfusions a week and a blood transfusion every fortnight to keep him alive. But any small infection could hit his weakened immunity hard. Sam said: “If you aren’t on top of it, it could be ­catastrophic. The doctors have to treat everything asit’s worst-case scenario.” Olcan’s energy levels are often very low, but his parents try their best to get him outside with brother, Hunter, four.  “We take him out to the beach or wherever, places where other people aren’t around,” Sam, a farmer, said. In July, Genevieve was offered a job in Belfast and moved with her sons to Antrim, meaning Sam splits his time. It was soon after moving they noticed bruising on Olcan’s ankles. Then during a walk, he fell and his knees ­immediately turned “absolutely black and blue”. Tests in September showed he had the rare condition. Sam said he and Genevieve are amazed at how quickly he has adapted to hospital trips.  “He’s very intelligent,” Sam said. “We say you need a transplant because your blood cells need a kick up the bum.” Olcan is having immunosuppressive therapy called anti-thymocyte globulin, which could make him dependent of gruelling transfusions, and prolong his le until a donor is found. The severity of his condition means the chances of ATG working are fairly low. Sam said: “Within nine months most patients get an infection and die.”  He added as a family they are trying to raise awareness about becoming a donor. “The fact it could just happen to anyone is very upsetting,” he said.Register to be a bone marrow donor at: www.dkms.org.uk register-now Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TherapyOrgan donationParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

All were given temporary leave to remain in the UK but were ed to their country of origin after turning . The data was obtained by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism and relates to removals over the last five years. A report by the charity Refugee Support Network - now rebranded as Refugee Education UK - suggests some of those ing face perilous situations. Its researchers interviewed a range of Afghan ees for its After Return report, some of whom said they’d been caught in bombs or suicide attacks.  One, named only as Mohammed, told the charity in  that he’d been forced to join the Taliban for his own protection. He claimed he was “tortured” before leaving for the UK as a child and needed protection from his “enemies”. Then , he said: “I thought a lot about my decision, but I did not see any other way. I had to join the Taliban to be able to defend myself from my enemies and survive.” Others reported struggling with mental health issues, and accessing work and education. Under current laws, unaccompanied children arriving in the UK are expected to make asylum claims in the same way as adults - outlining exactly why ing to their home country would present a risk for them. Those rejected are granted leave to remain in the UK until six months before their th birthday.  Once this expires, children have the right to apply for an extension, but experts say very few of these applications are successful. Ben Davison, head of immigration at Ison Harrison Solicitors, said: If their appeal is unsuccessful, thataposs the point where the Home Office can take removal action. Appeals are more likely to be unsuccessful becauseitaposs going to be recognised that they will be at risk, itaposs usually recognised first time around. They can argue that they have established a private le in the UK, but there are specic rules. “Children generally need to have been in the UK for seven years to show it would be unduly harsh to remove them and those who have been here for a shorter period donapost meet that set criteria. Many are left in limbo as they wait for their claims to be processed - often housed in poorly maintained asylum accommodation. Mr Davison says that, even in light of the Taliban takeover, there is no guarantee those who arrived as unaccompanied children will be allowed to stay. He added: Itaposs not enough to simply say, aposAfghanistan has been taken overapos. It will be upon the applicant - child or adult - to make a case for why they particularly are at risk.  Our data relates to at least  asylum seekers removed from the UK between  and . It comes amid a spike in desperate asylum seekers paying traffickers to get them to the UK due to the lack of safe routes. Last month,  people drowned in the Channel while trying to reach Britain on a dinghy. A Home Office spokesman said: “Those with no right to be in the UK and foreign national offenders should be in no doubt that we will do whatever is necessary to remove them. “This is what the public rightly expects and why we regularly operate flights to dferent countries.” A foreign national offender is anyone remanded or convicted on criminal charges who does not have an absolute legal right to remain in this country. But when asked by the Mirror, the Home Office was unable to say how many,any, of the  people in question had been convicted of crimes. The spokesman added: “In light of the developing situation, we suspended s to Afghanistan in July and we do not carry out enforced s to Syria for the same reason. “We keep s under review and make assessments based on the latest country information.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON TalibanHome OfficeMental healthIraq\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Urenna Okonkwo is set to marry her fiancé Emmanuel in Nigeria on December  but their plans could be left in tatters, MyLondon reports.But the country has now been placed on the UKaposs red list - meaning whoever leaves England to celebrate with them faces a £,-per person hotel quarantine bill. The couple from Blackheath, south east London, were hoping to be joined by friends and family and say they now canapost sleep due to the worry. They made plans earlier this year and have already shelled out on their big day after inviting around  people.  After picking December for the traditional wedding because their family would already be flying back home to spend Christmas with their loved ones, they thought it was the ideal time. But Urenna said: We booked hotel rooms for guests, money we canapost get backthis doesnapost go ahead, itaposs a nightmare. The past few days have been very stressful, finding out alternative solutions, Iaposve barely slept since Saturday evening, I donapost want to dwell too much on the problems, right now we are thinking of solutions. I have a very big family so quarantine would be an extra £,! Itaposs now a waiting game with the red list reviewed every three weeks, meaning they wonapost know more until December .  Alongside this, the couple will also be spending £, on their English wedding next summer. They say they have been left with no choice but to look for alternative plans. We donapost know how rules will change so we are looking at going somewhere  after Nigeria, rather than coming directly back to UK, the bride-to-be added. We are exploring dferent options, because no one can pay that £, unless youaposre a millionaire, then you add up Covid tests - my whole family wont be able to do that. Also some of my immediate family work in healthcare so they cannot take time off work to quarantine or go somewhere , they have uni and January exams, they cant even have the extra ten days - they wouldnapost be able to go there at allit stays on red list. The night before the wedding is a smaller ceremony called Marriage Rites, people from the home town meet with the family of the groom and they do bride pricing and dowry. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here.

When Rick Ackers, from Wigan, North West England, bought Labrador Reggie after seeing him on a selling website, his family fell in love instantly. Rick’s then seven-year-old son became best friends with the pup. “He found love in our house,” Rick said. “He never left our side for the short time he was with us.” But just days later, the le of their newest family member was cruelly cut short after Reggie fell ill with a serious virus and had to be put to sleep.Rick was left heartbroken, and his young son tearfully asked himSanta could bring back their beloved dog. “It did cut him up,” Rick said.“I saw him talking to the ashes of Reggie on the fireplace.”  Reggie developed canine parvovirus, which was thought to be due to being taken from his mother too soon and not having his vaccinations as the seller had promised. It was later discovered that the Labrador had likely come from a puppy farm, born and raised in appalling conditions which probably contributed to his death. After Reggie died, Rick made it his mission to change the way that dogs and puppies are sold online by launching the aposJustice For Reggieapos campaign, so that other dog owners wouldn’t have to face the same heartbreak that his family had been put through. He launched a petition urging the UK Government to regulate websites where dogs are sold, by introducing new measures like verying the identity and address of sellers, and compulsory pictures of the puppies with their mothers, to help put a stop to greedy puppy farmers making quick cash.  After the petition shot up to over , signatures from fellow animal lovers, the issue is set to be debated by MPs in Parliament on December . It’s hoped that they will agree to bring in these new measures - known as Reggie’s Law, in honour of Rick’s beloved puppy. Rick planned a gruelling -mile walk from his home in Wigan all the way to London to hand-deliver the successful petition to Number . The inspiring journey aimed to raise money for Hope Rescue, a charity that saves stray and abandoned dogs in South Wales. Rick finally arrived on Tuesday afternoon and was joined by dozens of dog lovers for the final stages of the gruelling trip. Rick was pushed to the limits on the trek, and was even hospitalised after the skin on his feet wore away and developed an infection. He managed to walk an incredible  miles before being medically advised to rest by doctors. While Rick admits that he has been “suffering to the max” on his walk, he adds that, “nothing comes close to what Reggie and others have felt. He said that thinking of Reggie kept him going on his emotional journey, and he believes that the puppy will be looking down with pride at the campaign that has taken place in his name. We will change the law, he vows.

After arriving, Ryanaposs mum Margaret helped him to bed where he believed his chest pain was easing off - but just a few minutes later, he died. Despite paramedicsapos best efforts, his le couldnapost be saved. His cause of death will be confirmed in a post mortem later this week. His cousin Shannon explained: Ryan was at the blind tunnel at Darnick Street when he got pains in his chest. He then asked a passerby in a car for help and they refused and drove away. Ryan continued to walk home,which is a -minute walkyou arenapost struggling, so we donapost know how long it had taken him to walk home. Ryan wasnapost the type of person to ask for help so it took him a lot to ask a stranger in a car.  Ryan was a full-time carer for his mum Margaret who is said to be lost without him. In a bid to ease some of the burdens, a fundraiser has been launched to help pay for his funeral with well-wishers so far donating more than £. Shannon and the family are now urging people to be kind and help others. She added: Ryan was always smiling, always making people laugh, always the le and soul of every family event. He was so caring and would do anything for anyone. He kept himself to himself, no one has a bad word to say about him either. Ryan was also his mumaposs carer and did everything for her without even a grump. He was my aunt Margaretaposs only child, he was a healthy -year-old with no underlying health conditions. All the kids that know Ryan thought the world of him - everyone that knew Ryan loved him. He had plenty of time for anyone. A touching message on the fundraiser reads: Ryan was a great person, the most friendly guy I ever met. Always happy, a good neighbour and a better friend. He will always be remembered. Rest in peace my friend you will always be in our hearts. Margaret, we will always be at your sideyou need anything. Another added: As a mum to a mum, I just canapost imagine what you must be going through. Ryan was such a nice young man and a real tribute to you as a mum.

Ministers have been forced to double the number of rooms available as those ing speak out about the chaos they have been faced with. One family, a mum, dad and six-year-old boy have been ripped apart after they were told the child could not share a double room with his parents. After theirfrom South Africa the mum was sent one room in Gatwick and the dad and child sent to another in Milton Keynes at a cost of more than £,. Janine Akers, the boy’s grandmother, told The Times: “They haven’t told their son yet and I don’t know what the stress is going to be when he’s told.  The hotel would not let them book for the three of them to stay [together]. When they got the two room bookings confirmed they had no choice but to take them otherwise they may have been stranded over Christmas. “This is going to cost them around £,. They had to defer their flights for £, find additional accommodation in South Africa which was £, and then pay for the quarantine hotels. Last night Olivia Blake, the couple’s MP in Sheffield, said the situation was “ridiculous” and that she was aware of other examples. She said: “Splitting families up and one parent having the full responsibility while quarantining is a big ask.  They’ve had to do it because they don’t want to be stranded for Christmas. The government needs to urgently make more family rooms available for quarantine. They did not properly fund this scheme.” John England is stuck in Pretoria, South Africa as he and his young family are unable to booked a family room for the forced -day hotel isolation. The -year-old from Hampshire told the Times that they could not confirm when they could get a family room of four, despite phoning and emailing, and aposdo not want to be split upapos. He added that his we suffers from anxiety, and aposeven quarantine will impact her signicantly. If we’re split the kids would be devastated.apos The government said: “The quarantine measures we have in place are minimising the risk of iants coming into the UK and safeguarding the hard won progress of our vaccination programme. The majority of passengers who have used the managed quarantine service have been satisfied with the service and we aim to keep families together.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dr David Lloyd, a GP based in north London, has detailed the symptoms of the new iant primarily seen among younger age groups. Around % of children who have been confirmed as having the strain had reportedly developed a rash, he said. Alongside the rash were reports of symptoms including fatigue, headache and loss of appetite. According to Dr Lloyd, early cases of Omicron appeared to be presenting with slightly dferent symptoms to dferent strains.He toldSky Newsthat symptoms like fatigue, headaches and a loss of appetite seemed to be “quite important”, as was the emergence of a rash. “We’ve always had a small cohort of patients with Covid who are getting funny rashes but up to % of the Omicron children are getting an unusual rash,” he said. “So we’re starting to learn a little bit more about the virus and we are starting to look out for it.” Dr Lloyd carried on to say that the data suggested it does double “very quickly” in the number of people that were in the community. He added: “So let’s hope that it isn’t as deadly as the Delta and let’s hope that we can get on top of it. But it’s a concerning time.”Over the course of the pandemic, the NHS has listed three main symptoms of Covid to look out for in both adults and in children. The short list included a new, continuous cough, a high temperature and a loss of smell or taste. However, there had been calls for the list of symptoms to be expanded, as people with confirmed cases of Covid have reported a number of dferent symptoms. The World Health Organisationhas previously said there is no information at present to suggest the symptoms of the Omicron iant are dferent from other Covid- iants. Early data suggests that the new strain is more transmissible, but milder, than the Delta iant that is currently dominant across the world. Omicron cases in the UK have hit  today as  new infections have been confirmed. Professor Tim Spector, from the Covid Zoe app, said that in around  daysapos time the UK could have more cases of Omicron than some countries it had put on the travel red list.  The professor of genetic epidemiology at Kingaposs College London told BBC Breakfast: The official estimates are about -odd Omicron cases, and because the current testing is missing a lot of those, itaposs probably at least , to , I would guess at the moment.And we are expecting this to be doubling about every two days at the moment, soyou do your maths - say assumed itaposs , at the moment, and you think itaposs going to be doubling every two days, you can see that those numbers are going to be prettycertainly in about  days time. By that time, weaposll probably have more cases than they will in some of those African countries. So I think these travel restrictions do perhaps have their place initially, when cases are really low here and really high in the other country, but when we reach that equilibrium, thereaposs very little point in having them in my opinion.  Cases of the new Omicron covid iant are increasing across the UK after it was initially detected in southern Africa. New rules designed to slow the spread of the Omicron iant of coronavirus will see travellers having to take a pre-departure test before travelling to England from today. All travellers will be required to take a Covid- pre-departure test, amid warnings that the time between infection and infectiousness could be shorter with the new strain.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON BBCDeltaNHSKings College LondonWorld Health OrganisationDavid LloydAppsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke of York has instructed his legal team to “leave no stone unturned” in the lead up to the January  hearing, described as his “last ditch attempt” to get allegations he abused a teenage girl thrown out. Royal sources say he is “totally consumed” with the legal battle and has been staying up into the night to keep in constant conversation with his Calornia-based lawyers. Next Monday they are set to deliver their final submissions to the New York court before a decision is taken in the new year as to whether the Duke will face a full trial. Virginia Giuffre is pursuing Andrew through the civil courts. He is accused of “rape in the first degree” amid claims he forced Ms Giuffre, also known as Virginia Roberts, to have sex with him three times in  while she was trafficked around the world by the royal’s late paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein.  In August she sued the Queen’s son for unspecied damages which could run into millions of poundsshe is successful. Sources close to the Duke say he has become “incredibly stressed” in recent weeks after fearing his team’s strategy of not publicly responding to the claims is failing. Insiders also suggest he is extremely worried over the financial burden he has placed on the Queen, who agreed to personally meet his spiralling court costs, which could run into millions. Prince Andrew has denied the claims. One source close to Andrew said: “The tension in the camp is palpable. No one is really sure what Andrew’s involvement is other than asking a lot of questions, but he spends his days and nights poring over documents.  “He is totally consumed by it, keeping most irregular working hours so he can be in contact with his team. “He was particularly stressed a few days ago and was heard remonstrating with one of the team. The feeling was he was telling them to effectively cancel Christmas and get totally across all the eventualities of what could happen in the case so there are, as he put it, ‘no more surprises’. “It’s very much a last ditch attempt to get the case thrown out andthat doesn’t succeed he knows they are all potentially in it for the long haul.”  The Duke’s team want the “baseless lawsuit” thrown out, claiming Virginia Giuffre is looking to “achieve another payday at his expense”. Court documents filed on behalf of her lawyers condemned Andrew, , for launching a “baseless, defamatory” attack on her credibility, character and motives. Andrew’s team must meet Monday’s deadline to file a further response before the New York district judge Lewis Kaplan rules on the next stage. The judge has said he is targeting a date for trial between October to December . Prince Andrew has hired Hollywood lawyer Andrew Brettler from the £,-an-hour firm Lavely and Singer to represent him. Meanwhile, Andrew’s former friend, socialite Ghislaine Maxwell is on trial in New York for allegedly procuring and trafficking young girls for former lover Epstein. A source close to Andrew said he is “aware” the case is progressing but “has no involvement”.

Reports today have suggested that f ather and son have barely spoken over the last eight months and that relations between them are at an all-time low. It is alleged the pair have had only a few fraught conversations on the phone since Harry and we Meghan Markle quit their roles as senior royals and moved to Calornia in .And since stepping down as a working royal, Harry has spoken out several times criticising his father and the wider Royal Family. However, their bond hasnapost always been so strained - and Charles even stepped in to walk daughter-in-law Meghan down the aisle on her wedding day.  Here we look at Harry and Charlesapos fragile relationship and what their future might bring... Childhood daysHarry is the second son of Charles and his late ex-we Princess Diana. They also have an older son, Harry.Speaking in , Charles told a documentary, he tried to spend as much time as he could with his young sons. However, royal biographer Penny Junor once claimed that Charles had been a remote figure. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.She told the Daily Beast : It is a slightly tricky relationship because Charles has always been quite a remote figure, he has always been consumed by work.That’s not a product of a lack of love. It’s a product of the fact he is so focused on his work, and the need to make a dference in the world that, like many people who are seeking to make a dference in the world, he has sometimes overlooked friends and loved ones beside him.” Dianaaposs death  As a young boy, Harry saw the breakdown of his parentaposs marriage, which played out in the full media spotlight. In  - a year after Charles and Dianaaposs orce was finalised - Diana died following a horric car crash in Paris, leaving her two sons grief-stricken. Both William and Harry were staying at Balmoral with Charles at the time, and it was down to their dad to break the terrible news to them. In , Harry praised Charles for the way he looked after both him and William in the wake of their tragic motheraposs death.In a BBC documentary, Harry said: One of the hardest things for a parent to have to do is to tell your children that your other parent has died. How you deal with that, I donapost know. But, you know, he was there for us.He was the one out of two left and he tried to do his best to make sure that we were protected and looked after. But you know, he was going through the same grieving process as well. Closer than William Also in , Harry guest-edited The Today programme on BBC Radio , where he interviewed Charles - affectionately calling him aposPaapos. In the interview, Harry revealed how he values his fatheraposs opinion saying: I do end up picking your brains more now than I ever have done.Speaking earlier this year, royal expert and author Robert Jobson even remarked how Harry had been closer to his father than William. Wedding woes  In , Harry started dating his now-we Meghan with the pair tying the knot at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor in May . In the lead-up to the wedding, it was revealed that Meghanaposs father Thomas would not be attending - prompting Charles to step in and walk Meghan part-way down the aisle. Speaking about the moment, Harry told a  BBC documentary: I asked him to and I think he knew it was coming, and he immediately said aposyes, of course, Iaposll do whatever Meghan needs and Iaposm here to support you.apos For him, thataposs a fantastic opportunity to step up and be that support, and you know heaposs our father so of course heaposs going to be there for us. The wedding also took place just weeks before a special Buckingham Palace garden party was held to mark Charlesapos th birthday. There, Harry made a touching speech and said: His enthusiasm and energy are truly infectious it has certainly inspired William and I to get involved in issues we care passionately about and to do whatever we can to make a dference. In fact, many of the issues William and I now work on are subjects we were introduced to by our father growing up. Sandringham summit After just over a year as working royals, Harry and Meghan decided they want to quit the Firm and step down from their roles.A summit was held at Sandringham between the Queen, Harry, Charles and William to thrash out a deal - and Harry and Meghan eventually settled in Calornia with young son Archie. Earlier this year, the Mirror revealed that Charles had been working hard to keep in touch with his son and his family.Oprah fallout In March , both Harry and Meghan sat down for a tell-all chat with Oprah Winfrey, which proved explosive.During the bombshell interview, Harry accused his dad of cutting him off financially and claimed he had stopped taking his calls. My family literally cut me off financially, Harry said in March.Iaposve got what my mum left me, and without that, we would not have been able to do this. I think she saw it coming, Harry said, adding that it was the inspiration behind Harry and Meghan seeking to land a Netflix deal.Harry also said he felt really let down by his father, saying: He knows what pain feels like. Of course I will always love him but thereaposs a lot of hurt thataposs happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that. In addition, Harry has also appeared on the Apple TV series The Me You Canapost See, where he spoke about the royalsapos total neglect and the Armchair Expert podcast, where he lashed out at Charlesaposs parenting.  He told the podcast : When it comes to parenting,Iaposve experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, Iaposm going to make sure I break that cycle so that I donapost pass it on.Itaposs a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on anyway, so we as parents should be doing the most we can to try and say aposyou know what, that happened to me, Iaposm going to make sure that doesnapost happen to youapos. UK visits Shortly after the Oprah interview, the royals went into mourning after the death of Prince Philip at the age of .It saw Harryto the UK for the first time since quitting the Firm to attend his grandfatheraposs funeral. Many pinned their hopes on the reunion of father and son being the catalyst for them to clear the air. But following the service, Harry quickly ed to the US, where Meghan had remained as she was heavily pregnant with their daughter Lilibet. A source told the Mirror at the time: Harry didn’t expect everything to be completely back to normal but his feeling after seeing his family was there is a lot of ground to make up.Whether that is harder or easier to do on the other side of the world remains to be seen There is a lot of distrust in the camp and everything is still very, very raw. Harry also travelled to the UK several month later in July to unveil a statue of his late mother Princess Diana - but on this trip, didnapost see Charles. aposWhackingapos Charles It has recently been reported that Harry met with Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz in  after the Saudi tycoon gave £, to the princeaposs charity and hinted he would give millions more. Mahfouz later donated £.million to Charles’ Prince’s Foundation and received an honorary CBE months later. The Charity Commission has launched an investigation. Mr Mahfouz denies any wrongdoing and Clarence House has previously said Charles had no knowledge of the alleged cash for honours scandal. In a statement at the weekend, Harry said he severed ties with Mahfouz a year before he was presented the CBE and said he had concerns over the businessman’s ‘motives’.And Angela Levin, Harry ’s biographe r, said: He doesn’t mention Charles by name in his statement but it’s a clear case of one-upmanship.Harry looks for any occasion to whack his father and criticise him. It’s sad. Future relationship   Now in the wake of that statement, it is reported that Harry and Charles have barely spoken in eight months. In fact, Charles is still yet to meet his six-month-old granddaughter Lilibet. Next year, Harry is set to release a tell-all memoir, which he promises will be a wholly-truthful and accurate account of his le so far.And author Andrew Morton, who famously wrote a biography on Princess Diana, says that Charles could be in the firing line again when Harryaposs book is published.He told the Royally Us podcast: If I was Prince Charles, I’d be looking for a pile of coats to hide under. Because I think that the book that’s going to come out next year is written by someone who spends a lot of time investigating father-son relationships because he ghost-wrote a book on Andre Agassi, who had a dficult relationship with his father. So I think we’re going to see Charles once more in the firing line. SoI was Prince Charles, I’d be looking for a hard hat and a flak jacket.But according to The Sun, Charles, , is keeping a dignied silence about his relationship with his son. And one former aide to The: The prince absolutely adores Harry. He will feel absolutely devastated by this distraught.He’ll be beside himselfthis means he also becomes more ostracised from his grandchildren. It’s such a sad state of affairs.

Families dubbed the Christmas meet-and-greet embarrassing and a shambles after kids queued for ages to sit down with Mr Claus at Northallerton Town Hall on Friday.The volunteer Santa turned up in the back of a x with the rest of the traffic and without prior warning, meaning the kids were busy when he arrived, one annoyed mum said.And some children didnapost get to meet St Nick because organisers, Northallerton Council, ran out of presents, Yorkshire Live reports. Parents claimed their kids were distraught after the Christmas do, with some coming away and askingthey could meet the real Santa.Another ticked off mum said she wondered how many kids went home not believing.  The free event was held on Friday at Northallerton Town Hall and was organised by the town council, who have responded to the complaints saying that it will have a review and publish an online survey to establish where improvements can be made for the future. One parent who visited with her five-year-old son told YorkshireLive that overall it was a complete shambles. She said: The main issues were that Santa arrived at .pm with the rest of the traffic with no warning before. Most people hadn’t even arrived at this point. My little boy was on a ride at this point and missed him.  The High Street was kept open during the event, despite the ongoing Town Square regeneration works which meant there was less space for families to manoeuvre. The woman added: There was people trying to dodge traffic with their little ones in the dark. Santa then appeared at the town hall doors and a huge group of people were pushing and shoving to get to the front - there was absolutely no organisation at all. The Santa was absolutely terrible. His outfit was falling to bits and his beard was hung down below his chin. One man said to the security stood next to Santa how rubbish the he was and they just laughed at him. My little boy was really upset. We didn’t get the chance to meet Santa as they ran out of presents and he knew he was a fake as he kept asking ‘where is the real Santa ’ Other comments on a community page include one person who said the event should have been cancelled. She wrote: A very big disappointment  embarrassment to Northallerton. I feel sorry for the children, tonight was something for them to look forward to after last year. It would be interesting to know how many children have stopped believing. Another wrote: Embarrassing for our town! The whole thing was a shambles. Why did they not close the road for a start  Cars and buses trying to get through crowdaposs of people, theyaposre lucky no one got hurt. Were they expecting just a few people to turn up. Such a shame for the kids . A spokeswoman at the council said: Northallerton Town Council would like to thank everyone who attended the Festive Friday event. There was a lively atmosphere on the High Street, due to the very high attendance, with more than  children receiving presents from Santa and High Street businesses benefiting from additional custom during late opening. We had detailed discussions with representatives of Hambletons Multi-Agency Safety Advisory Group beforehand and were advised that closure of the High Street was not necessary. However, space restrictions around the Town Hall, caused by the Town Square reconstruction works, meant it was more crowded on the night than had been anticipated. All those who wanted to meet Santa were able to do so. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that some negative comments have been posted on social media and, as always after events, we will undertake a thorough review to establish where improvements can be made for the future including an online survey of the public about the evening.

The current list of symptoms on the NHS website has remained unchanged since the first lockdown, even with the detection of other iants such as Delta.Medics in South Africa, where the iant was first detected, are saying the main symptoms of Omicron are fatigue, body aches and a headache. One UK expert said up to one in four colds could currently be Covid as the symptoms become more mild. Dr Angelique Coetzee, a private practitioner and chair of the South African Medical Association, said patients have not been reporting a loss of taste and smell.It comes as Covid cases in the UK are increasing and so are concerns about the Omicron iant, with an expert saying there are likely to be more than , cases of Omicron in the UK, just  days after the coronavirus was first discovered. The strain was first located in the UK in Chelmsford and Nottingham on November , , after initially detected in southern Africa.Since then, cases have been rapidly increasing across the country. Today Boris Johnson told his Cabinet that early indications show Omicron transmits more easily than the previously dominant Delta iant. Today, the total number of Omicron cases in the UK hit  as  new infections have been confirmed. This includes a further  cases in England,  in Scotland and one in Wales, according to figures from the UK Health Security Agency. It is not yet knownthe new iant increases hospital admissions or is impacted by the common vaccines.Professor Paul Hunter, from the school of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said it is spreading rather more quickly than the Delta iant. The professor told BBC Breakfast it was not clear how evidence from South Africa would translate to the UK as we have a highly vaccinated population.He added: How itaposs likely to spread in the UK still uncertain, but I think the early signs are that it will probably spread quite quickly and probably start outcompeting Delta and become the dominant iant probably within the next weeks or a month or so at least.  The big remaining question is actually how harmful it isyou do get Covid with this Omicron iant, and thataposs the question that weaposre struggling to answer at the moment. Kingaposs College Londonaposs Professor Tim Spector, who is the lead on the ZOE Symptom Tracker App, said data from the app suggests about half of all cases are being missed because people are not presenting with classic Covid symptoms. He said: Omicron is probably more, much more similar to the mild iants weaposre seeing in people who have been vaccinated with Delta than anything .  And so it is going to be producing cold-like symptoms that people wonapost recognise as Covidthey just believe the official Government advice. Speaking to Times Radio, he added: “We’re estimating that somewhere between one in three and one in four colds are actually due to Covid. “And so that’s quite a high rate of people that are currently not even bothered to get a lateral flow test, or getting a PCR test, going to parties and spreading it around.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BBCNHSKings College LondonUniversity of East AngliaPaul HunterAppsHospitalsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByMya BollanTrainee Trends WriterDiana Buntajova:,  Dec Those who regularly reach for the box of paracetamol to keep an ache or pain at bay should be aware of what the warning signs of the possible side effects look like. From reducing a fever to keeping that hangover at bay, the painkiller can be taken in the form on tablets, capsules, syrup or as a dissolvable tab. It is also an ingredient of many other types of medication. However, much like any other medicine, paracetamol has a list of possible side effects. These warning signs can be a range of things, including something you might notice when using the loo. The NHS reports that paracetamol “rarely” causes side effectsyou stick to the right dosage.The usual recommended dose is one or two  milligram tablets taken up to four times in a -hour period, according to the health body.However, like any drug, paracetamol also has possible side effects some people can experience, reports The Express.One side effect, which warrants medical help and ceasing its use, is dark pee, as reported by Drugs.Dark pee is associated with another side effect of the drug - jaundice. Jaundice describes your skin and the whites of your eyes turning yellow.  The health portal Patient.Info explains that jaundice can occur because of paracetamol poisoning. This can cause acute liver failure, which may turn your skin and eyes yellow. Jaundice is triggered by high blood levels of the bile pigment called bilirubin in your body. This bile can turn your pee dark. Apart from dark urine, jaundice can also be spotted when you have a poo as it can colour your stool clay.If you experience any symptoms linked to jaundice you need to get “urgent medical help”, the NHS warns.Drugs also advises stopping taking paracetamolyou’re doing so. However, jaundice and toilet signs are not common paracetamol side effects. To see a full list of possible side effects, refer to the patient information leaflet that came with your medicine. To avoid any unwanted problems caused by the drug, the NHS stresses the importance of sticking to the right dose. Another “serious” side effect that can happen in some cases is an allergic reaction to the medicine. The warning signs to spot include: Skin rash that may include itchy, red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin Wheezing Tightness in the chest or throat Trouble breathing or talking Swelling of mouth, face, lips, tongue, or throat.

And last year, the couple was spotted browsing for the perfect tree at a store in Santa Barbara.But it appears that one young boy, who happened to be in the shop at the same time mistook Harry for one of the staff selling the trees. According to reports from the time, an arrangement had been made for Harry and Meghan to be allowed into the shop while it was empty but one family happened to still be inside.  The excited child ran through the trees to the duke and askedhe worked here, shop salesman James Almaguer claimed. He went on to describe Harry, , as a chill lad and Megan, , as very kind.Posting on Twitter, James wrote at the time: Meghan and Prince Harry came into my work today and we sold them their Christmas tree.It was anticlimactic, but a very, very interesting experience.

There was one family in there and their stoked little son ran through trees up to Harry and askedhe worked here not knowing who that is. They seem like very nice people honestly. Meghan sounds very kind and Harry sounded and acted like a chill lad honestly. I’m really glad they liked our trees. We got the best we could get. Very appreciative.  It is believed that Harry and Meghan will be spending Christmas in Calornia again this year with son Archie and baby daughter Lilibet.The couple had reportedly been invited to join the rest of the royals at Sandringham for Christmas. But a source told Page Six : “There’s a lot that goes into the logistics and the planning of the family Christmas, so of course, staff know that Harry and Meghan are not coming.“If they were, they would have communicated it to their family by now. “But this is Her Majesty’s first Christmas without her husband, so one would have hoped they would want to be with her.” The Sussexes have not commented on the claims.Meanwhile, the Queen is said to be looking forward to hosting her traditional family get-together.It is understood Her Majesty will travel to Sandringham on or around Friday, December . Christmas guests will include Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall as well as Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge and their three children.

He said: William is completely loyal to his father. Any perceived slight to his father, even from his own brother is something he inevitably will respond to.

Yanice Wood, , was verbally abused by a stranger who swore at her and said aposgo back to your own countryapos. The horried teen was shocked during the incident in a housing estate in Edinburgh, and the altercation was caught on camera. A woman wearing a green jacket and carrying two Farmfoods bags walks passed her before stopping to turn and spit at her. As she spits, a disgusting pray of saliva is seen coming out of the vile womanaposs mouth and flying towards the -year-old nursery teacher.  The camera then moves to Yaniceaposs pink jacket, where a patch of spit is seen, as the middle-aged woman walks off shouting. She can be heard hurling abuse at Yanice, saying: Away you go you f*****g specky c**t. “Because I’ve got cancer in the mouth you silly cow. “Away you go back to your own country. “You have AIDS now.”  Yanice, from Edinburgh, says: “Ew get your f*****g black teeth out my f*****g face. “What the f**k  “F*****g b***h. I got that on video you f*****g ugly c**t. “She f*****g spat on me.” Yanice’s friend can then be heard saying: “You f*****g racist b***h. Racist b***h. “Shut up you fat b***h, go to the gym. “She’s got AIDS and she’s just spat on you. “She just said ‘you’ve got AIDS now you f*****g b***h’. “She literally just said that.”Speaking to Edinburgh Live, Yanice said: “The lady stated before getting on a bus she would pull my hair outI looked at her again.“I ignored her then we got off at the same stop as each other where she began to scream in my face. “I told her to get away from me which resulted in her spitting on me. “Then when she was walking away she was screaming ‘go back to your own country’. “I was shocked and disgusted. “I felt very uneasy as this lady stood and screamed in my face and felt absolutely disgusted once she spat on me.” Yanice said she reported the incident to Police Scotland. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: Officers were called around .pm on Monday  November, to a report of racial abuse in Muirhouse Gardens, Edinburgh. Enquiries into the incident are ongoing.

The victim suffered a blade wound to her cheek in the terrying ordeal, during which the men grabbed cash and jewellery. CCTV captured the moment the gang - one of which she believes was wielding a gun - burst into her home after throwing a brick through the back door.The mum-of-two said she was in the bathroom when she heard a loud noise at around .pm on Saturday, Liverpool Echo reports.She said: I heard a bang while I was in the shower. Iaposve got two dogs and they were barking but with the wind I thought something had fallen in the garden.  I heard another bang and with that I jumped out of the shower and saw three masked men with knives and a gun demanding cash and jewellery. The -year-old said she told them she did not have anything of value, but added: One of the lads pinned me down on the bed. He put the kne against my face. They cut my face. I said there was money in the drawer - there was only a small amount. I gave them my watches and jewellery and they were screaming aposis that all you have got, is that all apos  The student paramedic, who did not want to be to be named for fear of reprisals, said she had called the police during the incident and the men left her Bebington home after becoming spooked. Unsure why she was targeted, she said she wondered whether the men had seen her expensive dogs and mistakenly believed she bred them. She was home alone at the time and was grateful her children were not with her, she continued: They put a brick through my back kitchen door - itaposs full glass. My little girl could have been at home, eating her dinner at the table. Iaposm just grateful the children were not here.

The pair thought the deep-sea monster was a turtle or even an old rucksack, before dad-of-one Paul flipped it over, cutting his hands on hundreds of razor-sharp teeth. The couple spotted the adapted dorsal fin which emits a luminescent light to catch other fish.  Paul, , and Katrina, , left the beast, which was dead, to be reclaimed by the tide and continued their weekend break with Paul’s son Lucas Ashurst, , in Salcombe. The family, from Doncaster, Yorkshire, said they felt lucky to have seen the amazing creature. Katrina said: It was the most amazing experience.  “I just kept watching it, wondering what it was. “We didn’t realise it was upside down, then we flipped it and saw all these teeth and the dangly thing like a fishing rod. “It was so big - easily twice the size of a football. “A woman told us what kind of fish it was, and then I saw one had washed up in Calornia, and it’s the exact same fish.”  Electrical-engineer Paul said: “The teeth were like razor blades, I hardly touched it and I got these deep cuts all over my hands. “I kept washing them in the sea but they wouldn’t stop bleeding. “Not many people can say they’ve been bitten by one of those: I feel very privileged.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Staycation\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On December  , over , Americans died, with the majority of those dying as a result of the Japanese bombings on the USS Arizona and USS Oklahoma. Around  minutes into the attack, the USS Arizona was hit with a , pound naval projectile that ignited £m worth of explosives. The ,-ton battleship was lted into the air before it hit the water and sank, and continued to burn for two-and-a-half days. In total, out of the , crew members,  people survived, which meant that , people lost their lives.YouTuber and mortician Caitlin Doughty known as ‘Ask A Mortician’ has done some research on what happened to Pearl Harbor’s dead. In her video, she said: “As we were working on this video, I remembered all the times I went to the Arizona memorial as a child. “I remember looking down into the water, where you can still see the eerie outline of the ship and wondering ‘are they still down there ’” The short answer to that is yes, according to Caitlin, many of the bodies remain down there because of the aposintense fire, twisted metal and inaccessibility of the ship.apos She continued: “At the time of the attack, identication or retrieval of the bodies was pretty much impossible. “Only  people were positively identied, leaving  people to fall into dferent categories.” The first category was bodies that were never found and the second was bodies or parts of bodies removed from the ship. These bodies were buried in temporary mass graves, declared ‘unknowns’ and reburied at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacic. Some remains couldn’t even be recovered because they were in the rear portion of the ship. Caitlin said: “When it was determined that the USS Arizona could not be salvaged, the navy decided that it would be ‘too dficult to remove the dead in a respectful manner’. “So , people remain entombed in the USS Arizona, considered buried at sea.” Interestingly, many of the surviving crew members have opted to have their cremated remains thrown into the sunken battleship. She continued: “For the families of those who died on ships like the USS Oklahoma, there is no closure, as no wreck remains of the battleship. “On the morning of the attack [there were] , people on the ship as well as a -piece band assembled onto the deck for the morning colours ceremony.  “The ship was hit by several torpedoes which caused the ship to roll on its side in  feet of water, some crew jumped in desperation, others became trapped. “Some of the traps were rescued by crew members after banging against the wall for help, others tried to swim their way out.” A crew of  lost their lives that day, with the majority of them caught in the submerged ship. When the ship was eventually pulled upright in , the gathering and identication of the bodies was tough. Caitlin said: “As the bodies had been underwater for some time, they had decomposed to nothing but bones which had become intermingled with the ship. “Disentangling the bones, metal and oil was merely impossible with the technology of the time, as they relied on dental methods.” The bones were originally to be buried in a mass grave, but the military demanded that the skeletons be assembled as ‘whole sets.’ Each set was buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacic as ‘unidentied’. She continued: “But in , a survivor named Ray Emory got officials to exhume the casket of Eldon Wyman the remains of four others were found to be in the casket. “With further DNA testing, there were in fact the remains of  other people in the casket.” In , The Pentagon decided to attempt to identy all of the USS Oklahoma’s unidentiable remains.As reported by The New York Times, the remains of  sailors and Marines from the U.S.S. Oklahoma were identied using DNA and dental records, but  crew members could not be.On December , , the remains of those who remain unidentied will be re-entered at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacic.

Having me on my knees doing whatever you say... xxx. Dr Samuel removed the clip from his official website before a spokesman claimed it was uploaded by hackers. The footage had already been widely shared on social media, where users joked about the doctoraposs blunder, MailOnline reports.Broadcaster, Jon Gaunt, who interviewed the medic, even posted the video on his own accounts, saying: Oh dear someone forgot to turn their WhatsApp off! This is very funny.aposOne Twitter user joked: aposDr Sam White uploaded this video to his website but in his over-eagerness to get his aposmessageapos out, he obviously didnapost watch it back first. Unlucky Sam, unlucky.aposAnother said: aposIaposd like to hear what Suzie Sub thinks about all this. Apparently Dr Sam White is a fan.apos  A third quipped: aposMaybe Dr Sam has an important message about wearing masks The message showed up as the doctor discussed the Governmentaposs response to coronavirus.His appearance came just days after a judge announced an error of law had been made after he was ordered to stop discussing Covid online.Dr Sam was accused of spreading misinformation after raising his concerns about vaccines and posting a video claiming masks do nothing, the BBC reports.Restrictions were imposed on Dr Whiteaposs registration by the General Medical Councilaposs Interim Orders Tribunal as a result of his wild claims. But the High Court has now ruled that decision contravened human rights law. The tribunal feared the manner in which he shared his views may have a real impact on patient safety.He accused the NHS and government of spreading lies and that he couldnapost stomach or tolerate them any longer.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WhatsAppHuman rightsCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineDoctors\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Candice said: “In September  I had the fillers that were in my lips, cheeks and jawline all removed. “I realised that it wasn’t enhancing my beauty to continue to get this kind of work, it was making me look older having so much in my face. “A lot of young women get filler to look younger but we don’t realise when it’s gone too far. aposI spent years looking fake but now I want to be a natural beauty.  “Now that Iaposve got rid of it I feel so much better. “I had forgotten what my face looked like without filler!” Candiceaposs family and friends were used to her Barbie-like appearance but when she first started transforming into a doll, the modelaposs parents were a bit shocked. She said: “My mum is very happy I’m becoming more natural, she doesn’t like filler. “My dad is indferent, he is used to me being out there. “I think because it’s so dramatically dferent to my natural look they were quite surprised but they’re very supportive. “It’s my face and body.” In an emerging trend over the past few years, Candice has followed in the footsteps of other celebrities and influencers who are reversing their non-surgical beauty choices. One such person includes Love Islandaposs Molly-Mae Hague, , who recently dissolved her fillers.Thereaposs also Khloe Kardashian, who has had fillers multiple times in the past, having said that she looked crazy.Although she is easing back on the injectables, Candice still likes to put on a full face of makeup every day, which takes her roughly  minutes.

We’ve had the pandemic, the pingdemic and now - the partydemic. Yes, drape some tinsel, model a Christmas jumper and head out to your work’s Christmas bash. aposTis the season to be jolly, right  Wrong. The Omicron iant has meant numerous companies have canned their Christmas parties. Perhaps yours is one of them, and now youaposre stuck at home with a glassfor company.Don’t feel sad. I am here,not as aAngel, to argue…guess what  Nobody should mourn Christmas parties. If anything, despondency is pure Stockholm syndrome. Rather, apostis the season to be relieved at escaping utter chaos. Where to begin  Outfits are a good place to start. Unless you’re me. What I know about fashion fits on the back of a postage stamp. Dress codes are immensely ambiguous. Black tie  Christmas jumper  Or the worst code of all - smart casual. That I a recently wore double denim and b did not care only demonstrates the fashion nightmare any gathering brings.  That’s before the location. In the city is fine . Out in the countryside, disaster is guaranteed. Drivers getting lost, monumental pricing, traipsing to some country home: you are asking for trouble. Any gathering is all about the food. I want a three-course meal to die for, a sweet and savoury buffet with ine choice. In reality  Christmas bashes contain little more than last-minute supermarket nibbles. Worse still is bringing your own food to share - no thank you!  I’m a natural introvert, so any large-scale socialising is challenging. Despite my best efforts, endless procrastination means pre-planned conversation topics before said gathering never materialise, with discussion drying up quicker than the nearby seafood platter. I can only repeat my excitement at Christmas arriving so many times, with Christmas cracker conversation starters rarely saving me. There is music to deal with too at a Christmas bash. I love Christmas music at any time of year However, I’m hearing impaired so must shout as loud as possible, practically breaking Guinness World Records to be heard. Bellowing into someone’s ear is hardly an ideal situation, in or out of a pandemic.Do you love a Christmas bash or are you a party grinch  Have your say in the comments belowWhere music plays, a dance floor follows. Were I ever to appear on Strictly Come Dancing admit to rule breaking last Christmas , I would be booted off in the first week for crimes against art. At a Christmas party, it transpires dancing is mandatory. My moves, at best, are ‘drunk prancing’… and I’m teetotal.The morning after the night before is full of regrets. You may have made a tremendously inappropriate remark to your boss and lost any remaining dignity. Normally, you believe next year will be better. Though I love the naive optimism, be honest. It won’t. Sure, go for a Christmas meal, where the food is at least the focus. Butyou’re asked to dance, escape while you can.

Hermit Agafya Lykova, , is getting a solar  to provide electricity to power a satellite phone to enable her to summon help to her remote home hundreds of miles from anywhere in Siberia. She has accepted the technological gadgetry amid concerns for her health in the remote snow forest - where temperatures plunge to minus C in winter . Agafya is the sole survivor of a family that in  fled into the wilderness - where she was born - to avoid religious persecution and death squads under Stalin. The Lykov family of devout Orthodox Old Believers remained undiscovered in the harsh wild for four decades staying out of sight for the Second World War and Yuri Gagarin’s landmark first manned mission to space. They lived - as she still does - guided by an old bible in the Western Sayan Mountains in an area where wolves and bears roam.  This year also saw a new one storey timber prefabricated home brought to her mountainside, replacing the tumbledown shack built by her father and brothers, where she was born. Soon after it was built, a fire partially destroyed her old home. Viktor Nepomnyashchiy, director of the Khakassky Nature Reserve, made a helicopter visit to the hermit to check on her wellbeing as the deepest winter sets in. “We delivered parcels, letters, presents and a solar , which was installed by volunteers,” he said.  “Agafya showed me the new house. “These days she has six goats, three cats and a dog called Tsvetochek .” Agafya has refused repeated attempts to persuade her to move to “civilisation” in a town or city. The improvements in the iconic Russian woman’s le have been funded by billionaire Oleg Deripaska, say reports. It was in  that her lost family were spotted by Soviet geologists flying over the remote mountains.  Special measures are being taken to avoid Agafya catching Covid- from occasional visitors, not least because it was the contact with Soviet people after four decades that led to her family members catching infections that killed them. “We all take extreme care when visiting Agafya,” explained local official Alexander. “Virus or no virus - she is like a Mowgli who has never come across modern day infections and diseases. “We know how disciplined and cautious we must be in making sure she stays safe.”  Agafya was the fourth child of Karp and Akulina Lykov, and for the first  years of her le she had no contact at all with anyone outside her family. Her mother died in , her father passed away in . Old Believers split from the Orthodox Church in  after protesting against reforms, and many moved to remote areas of Siberia in tsarist times.

Jessica Leidolph was left disfigured by the attack which almost cost the -year-old her le.She was mauled by the creature and after the animalaposs claw caught her carotid artery, it caused her to lose pints and pints of blood. She now has three metal plates on the right side of her face having attempted to bring out the product to raise funds to support unwanted animals. Now Jessica has decided to publish the calendar - despite the torment the shoot caused.  The page for August will always be etched in the modelaposs mind as within seconds of posing, the big cat called Troya pounced, biting her face and head. Jessica, who also worked as an animal rights activist and a physiotherapist, was critically injured after Troja attacked her out of nowhere during a photoshoot at a retirement home for show animals in the German city of Nebra. She underwent surgery after she was taken to the nearest hospital by helicopter on th August. But Jessica, who will reportedly have to carry the attack scars forever, begged the authorities not to put the big cat down, saying: I donapost want the animal to be killed, it just followed its instincts. It was unfortunate. I am glad there was no request to euthanise the animal. Jessica entered the leopardsapos enclosure at the aposSeniorenresidenz fur Showtiereapos - a retirement home for show animals - when the -year-old leopard suddenly attacked her.  Troja and another leopard living in the enclosure named Paris, , had once graced TV screens in an advert for multinational electronics giant Panasonic before they were moved to the retirement home in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt. She said: He attacked me, I couldnapost look that fast. I was sitting by the tree trunk and all of a sudden I was lying on the ground. He bit into my cheek, ear, head, and then again and again on my head. And then I screamed, put my hands in front of my face. At some point, he let go of me for a moment so that I could roll away and get out of the cage. A little while later, the ambulance and helicopter were there.  Jessica, who was brought to the hospital with severely bleeding wounds and was immediately operated on. She said she lost consciousness and the next thing she heard was the helicopter airlting her to hospital. However, instead of holding grudges, Jessica, who will reportedly have to carry the attack scars forever, has now shared images of the photoshoot as her new calendar is printed ahead of the new year. She said: I have been making yearly calendars with sexy photos of me and my proteges for many years. The sales will be used to maintain my private animal sanctuary.

Its destination: Mars.Touching down on the Red Planet on earth day February  , the two robotic companions began their lonely journey together trundling and hovering across the surface of the planet.Their mission is to find signs of habitability, as humanity continues to seethere really is any possibility of le on Mars - either for us or for something .As it goes about its mundane daily work looking for signs of ancient extraterrestrial le in a bid to save the human race, Perseverance pauses from time to time to take in its surroundings.But what did the rover spot when it looked up into space  What did Mars rover Perseverance see  Looking up it saw one of Marsapos two moons, Demios. Deimos is tiny, an irregularly shaped aposmoonapos in Marsapos orbit and is smaller than its larger sibling Phobos. Perseveranceaposs time-lapse lasts for  seconds and picks out a shining star-like object in the sky - this is Deimos. Its team said: Sky watching is fun no matter where you are. I took this short time lapse movie to watch for clouds, and caught something : look closely and you’ll see Deimos, one of two moons of Mars.  Deimos is the namesake of the Roman god of panic and is a mere seven miles in diameter, making it shorter than Manhattan in New York. It orbits the Red Planet once every  hours and has an unusual shiny appearance - It looks smooth, especially when compared to our own moon. This is because when it is struck by rocks in space it doesnapost have the gravitational force to pull back dust knocked off from it - instead they float into space. The dust is held in place by Marsapos orbit, so when Deimos comes around and passes once again it crashes through a cloud of its own matter burying the craters on its surface like ruins in a sandstorm, softening its details and giving it a shiny appearance. It also looks a bit like a potato.  What is Mars rover Perseverenceaposs mission  The rover aims to collect samples from ious points of interest on the surface of Mars. This will be with the overall goal of finding evidence of ancient microbial le and further efforts to better understand the habitability of Mars, past, present and future. It collects its samples with a drill, and then stores and preserves them so that future missions could potentially retrieve them andthem to earth for analysis. Its mission will last around one Mars year or  earth days. At the time of writing it has completed  Mars days, known as sols.

Crews of the Western Military District’s bomber regiment have started to perform the first planned flights at the reconstructed Baltimore airfield in Voronezh,” said a military statement.“During the training flights, the bomber crews practiced takeoff and landing in ious weather conditions.”Russia said last week that the first  Su- fighter bombers had been deployed at the base - and now flights have started. New footage shows the Su-s in action from the revamped base with a two-and-a-half mile long runway giving it “the ability to accept aircraft of all classes and any size”.  In Chelyabinsk, the command staff of the aviation regiment of the Central Military Districtflew more than  sorties in Su-s and the Su-MR reconnaissance aircraft. In Dagestan, Black Beret marines of the Caspian Flotilla, supported by aircraft, foiled a mock enemy landing in separate drills. And Russian reservists were given firepower training during a three day camp, according to reports citing military sources. They were trained in firing small arms and using RPG- anti-tank grenade launchers at the Prudboy combined arms range in Volgograd region.  The drills came as Russia hit out at “emotional statements” in the West on Putin’s alleged invasion plans inn Ukraine. “These statements are so exalted, they lack a sensible approach,” said his spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Ahead of the video summit, he said: Such a number of  reports are published in the media.  “We see that tensions are increasing in rhetoric, but still we urge to keep coolheadedness. “Moreover, presidents never speak based on emotions, they always speak de facto based on their national interests, He stressed: Putin has repeatedly said that we are looking for a good, predictable relationship with the United States.  “Russia never intended to attack anyone, but we have our own concerns, we have our own red lines. “The president spoke about this clearly, to which Biden replied that he was not going to recognise any red lines.” The talks at pm Moscow time todayare “convenient” for Putin, he said. This was “in the middle” of the Putin workday.

Two dogs were found dead in the “tightly secured” shed with its door and window blocked up, with a “huge pile of moulding faeces” next to them. ISPCA inspector Fiona Conlon found the dogs on Christmas Eve  at the vacant property in County Carlow, Ireland. She told Carlow District Court she saw a small rusty coloured terrier running loose, before spotting the locked shed. She said it took her several minutes to remove the locks and tape holding the door closed.  When she got inside she found a larger Doberman cross and a white fawn terrier. Inspector Conlon described the dogs as “bony, gaunt and visibly undernourished”. There were empty containers and no food or water could be seen. She said she saw faeces which gave off a “horrendous stench”. The one live dog and two dead ones were removed and taken to a local vet. A post-mortem revealed the two dead dogs were dehydrated and emaciated with no body fat and no signs of food in their stomach before their deaths. Christine Browne, from Tullow, appeared at Carlow District Court on December  where she pleaded guilty to  offences under the Animal Health and Welfare Act . William Maher, who was acting on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture Food and the Marine, asked Inspector Conlon how she would rate the seriousness of the offences.  Inspector Conlon said the dogs were left to starve, dying a horrendous death while locked in a shed with no food or water. During sentencing, Judge Cephas Power said the evidence photos and statement from Inspector Conlon said the suffering the dogs endured was at the top of the scale. In addition to the disqualication, Judge Power imposed a five-month custodial sentence, suspended for one year and ordered that Browne pay a total of €, in court and ISPCA costs.ISPCA Inspector Conlon said: “As Animal Welfare Inspectors, we find dogs that are thin, injured or in need of veterinary care. You remove the animals from their bad situations, get them the attention they need and they have hope, hope for a better le.“In this case, there was no hope, the dogs were deceased. These two dogs were barricaded into a shed and deprived of the basic requirements to live, food and water. “These actions resulted in the poor dogs suffering a slow horrendous death the thoughts of which haunt me to this day.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AnimalsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Early religious writings tell the story that Thenew was a victim of her fatherrsquos cruel vengeance for what he believed to be her disobedience and wrongful behaviour.One early medieval account by Jocelinus, a monk from Furness, tells us: ldquoBy the kingrsquos command, she was led to the top of a very high hill called Dunpelder, that, cast down from thence, she might be broken limb by limb, or dashed to pieces.But that didnrsquot work, so she was instead taken to the shore of Aberlady and put into the small hide vessel, pulled from the shore and set adrt.Magsrsquo art captures the terror and desperation of Thenewrsquos situation, as her tiny boat is taken by the tide out to the open sea. It is rocked by waves and she clings on for le, the freezing water lapping over her.But thankfully, there is a happy ending to this story. Her small boat begins to drt inland, across the Firth of Forth, away from the kingdom of her abuser and towards the opposite shore, where she lands just in time. There, on the beach by Culross in Fe, she finds a fire with embers still giving warmth.Jocelinus tells us: ldquoThere were, in the neighbourhood, shepherds keeping watch over the flocks. And they beheld a fire lighted close at hand, and coming with haste found the young woman with her childbirth completed, and the child wrapped in rags, lying in the open air. They, moved by pity, took care of them by increasing the fire and supplying food, and procuring other necessarieshellipSt Serf took them in and cared for them, and Thenewrsquos child would become Saint Kentigern.This story is not provable history, of course, more likely itrsquos mostly legend making. Yet unknown truths often lie under the surface of legends and I for one have always seen the universal truths in this story.When I look into the faces of my children, I hope and pray they will never feel the fear and desperation that is on the face of Thenew of being cast at sea with the desperate hope of finding a safe place.And , God forbid, they ever do, I hope they will be met by people like those shepherds.Andever they, or I, were to meet someone in such a desperate situation, then I hope we would be like those shepherds and respond with kindness, understanding and compassion.That, for

measures, resulting in cars ldquohurtling down the hill of Haddington Road, picking up speed and then turning the corner to children crossing the road.A recent incident involving an S pupil has ignited further fear for parents in the area.A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ldquoAround .pm on Wednesday, November , officers were called to a report of a -year-old girl struck by a van on the B, North Berwick.ldquoShe was taken to hospital to be checked over, then later released.An East Lothian Council spokesperson added: ldquoWe are aware that a North Berwick High School pupil was involved in a collision with a vehicle near to the junction of Lochbridge Road and Haddington Road on November .ldquoPolice and ambulance were called to attend and the young person was taken to

cars, buses, lorries hurtling past at at least mph.ldquoThe nature of the road encourages you to pick up speed as it is wide, straight and goes downhill.ldquoThere are no signs about it being a school area until you get right to the school.ldquoThere are no crash barriers along this stretch of road ndash particularly needed at the bottom of the bank as this is where children regularly fall off scooters and bikes into the road as they shoot off the corner after gaining speed coming down the hill ndash literally not nearly a week goes by without us receiving messages of near misses.Another concern from families in the area relates to Covid restrictions, which mean parents are unable to wait in the school playground to collect their children, unless the child is in primary four or below.This has resulted in packed pavements, with people ldquohaving to step onto the main road to make way for prams, bikes, scooters and dogs.One parent said that the issues had been discussed with East Lothian Council, North Berwick Community Council, North Berwick Trust, the school and parent council, but that no solution had been found.They added: ldquoThere has been no movement in years to try to ensure our kids can get to and from school safely.A number of safety measures have been suggested, including a path from the newbuild homes to take children directly into school premises, a crash barrier along the pavement, a crossing from Lochbridge Road across Haddington Road ndash which is currently overseen by a crossing patrol during peak hours ndash or a reduced speed limit to mph

A mobile office and chemical toilet would also be onsite for that duration.It would require a -square-metre area in the north of the former power station site to be fenced off for the duration.Plans are with East Lothian Council and can be viewed on the planing portal."},{"url":null,"title":"snack-van-shore-road-car-park-john-muir-way-dunbar-approved","story":"The plans for the van at the Shore Road car park, on the John Muir Way at Belhaven, drew  protests and were described by one elected councillor as ldquosacrilege.Local residents pleaded with East Lothian Councilrsquos planning committee to refuse planning permission, arguing it went against everything naturalist John Muir, who was born in Dunbar, stood for and strived to achieve.Other residents pointed to road safety concerns on the streets surrounding the car park, which at one point last year saw , vehicles a day visiting it.Local residents said that their streets were already jammed by the overspill of the car park, which sits near a popular surf school which operates from the bay, adding that the snack van would only attract more visitors.One man said thathe left his home to go grocery shopping at the weekend, he wouldto find he could not park within half a mile of his home, adding: ldquoIf that is not impacting on my amenity, I donrsquot know what is.However, Councillor Norman Hampshire, local ward councillor, council leader and planning convenor, insisted that the snack van ndash which will be powered by batteries rather than a generator and use compostable cutlery ndash would be a welcome addition for people who visited the beach and walked the John Muir Way.He told protesters: ldquoA lot of people are not fortunate to be able to buy a house close to the beach and they would enjoy the opportunity to walk down there and enjoy a cup of coffee.Fellow ward councillor Sue Kempson called in the application for the van to the committee after planning officers recommended it for approval.At a previous bid to put a snack van on the site two years ago, which was thrown out,Dr Kempson described visitors to the van as having their ldquogrotty coffee, adding:ldquoIrsquom sorry but I have used snack bars and never had decent coffee [from them].Dr Kempson told the committee that she was concerned about the impact of the new snack van, which was being sited at a dferent point of the car park, further away from housing, on thegrass area it was designated.She supported residents concerns about the snack van being on the John Muir Way.She said: ldquoTo give permission for this van on the John Muir site, Dunbar, is to me sacrilege.Jacquie Bell, from Dunbar Community Council, which also objected to the snack van, pointed out that the Shore Road car park was ldquoan anomaly among coastal car parks in East Lothian because it was next to residential streets.She said: ldquoThis is not a NIMBY objection, the priority concern is road safety.And she criticised the council for advertising the site as a potential snack van placement, saying the financial gain for the local authorityof tendering the site was ldquooutweighedby the impact of the van.Bethan and Markos Akgum, who applied for permission to operate the snackvan at the site, said that they had switched to electric batteries and reduced the size of the van, as well as changing its colour, after feedback from the community.Bethan told the committee that plans were in place to monitor litter by using branded compostable containers, which she suggested could be marked with the initials of customers to make them more responsible for disposing of them properly.The efforts of the applicants were welcomed by many councillors on the committee.Mr Hampshire said that he had lived in Dunbar all his le and had fond memories of visiting the bay while growing up and with his family, and the provision of a snack van would be appreciated.He said: ldquoEvery time I am down at Belhaven, someone will come and ask me lsquowhere can I buy a coffee rsquo and there is nowhere, only a long, long walk to buy a cup of coffee.ldquoThe van will be adjacent to the John Muir Way and hundreds of walkers will welcome it. I think it will be an asset to people who use the bay.The committee voted by  votes to one to approve the snack van.

The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay. We must not forget the faithful service of the Golden Mariana and crew who have served the communities well.“From the information I have received from seagoing staff who have taken the Nordic Sea out in what could be described as ‘challenging conditions’, I have every confidence that the Papay community will not be disappointed in what is a first-class vessel.“We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland to enable the purchase of the vessel and are looking forward to the inaugural journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In an update to the Scottish Parliament this Tuesday afternoon, she explained that the nation#s coronavirus restrictions are to be reviewed on a daily basis in the wake of an increasing number of Omicron cases.She has urged everyone across Scotland to stick closely to the guidelines. This included strict guidance to employers with staff who can fulfil their duties from home and testing before mixing with people from other houses.These changes come as Orkney recorded seven cases over the past  hours, according to the daily figures published by the Scottish Government. This has brought the county#s total to .On the new restrictions, the First Minister said: “To be blunt,you had staff working from home at the start of the pandemic, please now enable them to do so again.##I#m asking you to do this from now, until the middle of January, when we will review this advice again.#She also said: #Test and Protect is deploying enhanced contact tracing for all cases with the s-gene drop-out that is indicative of Omicron. For these cases, household contacts of close contacts, rather than just the close contacts themselves are being asked to test and isolate.#For non-Omicron cases,you have COVID symptoms you are being urged to book a PCR test and self-isolate until you receive the result.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney.

the Afghanistan evacuation as the Foreign Officersquos top civil servant admitted he regretted continuing with his holiday while Kabul fell.Sir Philip Barton, permanent-under secretary at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office , told a Commons committee he wished that he had ldquocome back from my leave earlier.Having left for his holiday on August , the senior mandarin remained away for  days after Kabul was taken by the Taliban on August  following a lightning advance.ldquoI have reflected a lothellip, andI had my time again I would have come back from my leave earlier than I did, he told MPs.Later in the hearing, he said he did ldquoregret the fact that I didnrsquot decide to come back to support colleagues, but that he did not think his decision ldquoaffected the outcome of the evacuation.But he faced heavy criticism from MPs on the committee, including Conservative Alicia Kearns, who was heard to say he ldquocouldnrsquot be bothered.In a statement after the hearing, Tom Tugendhat, the Tory chairman of the committee, said: ldquoTodayrsquos session left the committee concerned about the Foreign Officersquos role in the evacuation effort.ldquoThis crisis demanded, and deserved, the full attention of the Foreign Office.ldquoThe evidence wersquove heard today points to a lack of leadership, urgency and adequate resourcing.It comes after awkward questions were posed of both the Prime Minister and his deputy Dominic Raab by a whistleblower testimony given to the committee.Former official Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office during the effort, claimed that just % of Afghan nationals who applied to flee under one UK scheme received help as a result of the ldquodysal and ldquochaotic handling of the situation.Mr Marshall told MPs that some of those hoping to escape were murdered after being left behind in Kabul.He also claimed Boris Johnson requested that ldquoconsiderable capacity was made available to evacuate animals from a shelter run by former Royal Marine Paul ldquoPen Farthing, putting the lives of troops at risk to help aid their departure on a privately-funded plane.Labour MP Chris Bryant, during Tuesdayrsquos committee hearing, said a leaked letter from the Prime Ministerrsquos then parliamentary aide to Mr Farthing confirming that the departure for him and Nowzad-shelter staff had been arranged, along with assistance for the transport of his animals, indicated that ldquothe Prime Ministerrsquos fingers are all over this. vw,vw,px, px\"Tom Tugendhat MP criticised a lsquolack of leadershiprsquo in the Foreign Office during the Afghanistan crisis Mr Johnson, speaking before the emergence of the letter, dismissed the allegations as ldquocomplete nonsense as he sought to defend British efforts following the fall of the Afghan capital.The Prime Minister told reporters ldquosometimes decisions took hours longer than we wanted during the evacuation, but ldquoyou have to be careful about how you do it, it was still an astonishing thing to get , people airlted out of Kabul in pretty harrowing circumstances.The Operation Pitting airlt ndash put in place as foreign forces withdrew after a -year occupation of the central Asian country ndash was ldquoone of the outstanding military achievements of the last  years or more, Mr Johnson added.Giving evidence to MPs, former ambassador to Afghanistan Sir Laurie Bristow said he had warned officials in London around August  that Kabul was likely to be overrun by Taliban fighters.According to reports, Mr Raab, who was then foreign secretary, did notfrom his holiday on the Greek island of Crete until August  ndash three days after Sir Laurie had flagged that Afghanistan was falling quicker than anticipated.Mr Raab also came in for criticism as part of Mr Marshallrsquos allegations, with it claimed that the Cabinet minister ldquodid not fully understand the situation, was slow to rule on cases and requested they were reformatted ldquoin a well-presented table before making a decision. vw,vw,px, px\"Lt Cdr Alex Pelham Burns, a member of the UK Armed Forces during the evacuation of entitled personnel from Kabul airport The senior Tory, who was moved to become Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister after his handling of the crisis, said ldquosome of the criticism seems rather dislocated from the facts on the ground.ldquoI do think that not enough recognition has been given to quite how dficult it was, he told the BBC.Among the flaws alleged by Mr Marshall was that the process of selecting who could be airlted out was ldquoarbitrary and dysal and that thousands of emails were going unread.Mr Marshall, who worked in the Afghan Special Cases team handling the cases of Afghans who were at risk because of their links with the UK, estimated ldquobetween , and , people including dependents applied for evacuation under the ldquoleave outside the rules category.But he calculated that ldquofewer than % of these people have received any assistance and stated that ldquoit is clear that some of those left behind have since been murdered by the Taliban.Asked by MPs about the figures cited by Mr Marshall to the committee, Sir Philip said: ldquoThere arenrsquot , to , people who are eligible to be in the UK.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Raab should have resigned over the Afghanistan crisis.We

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4289803.jpg--.jpg?1638799790000\n","title":"ballymena boy s artwork brings christmas card cheer","story":"THE festive artwork of  year old Adrian McVey from Castle Tower School in Ballymena has been chosen as Radius Housing’s  Christmas Card.

The low share of services in trade flows from Ireland to Northern Ireland is in contrast with the high overall services content of Ireland’s exports to other markets, ESRI report stated. Ireland is one of the main markets for services trade from Northern Ireland.   The reports, published on Tuesday, assess cross-border trade in services and “enhancing the attractiveness of the island of Ireland” to high-value foreign direct investment . The first of the set of economic reports examines the extent of cross-border trade in services on the island of Ireland and the characteristics of the firms participating in this trade. The main services traded include transportation and storage, business services and computer consultancy. Sales to Ireland account for % of services outflows from Northern Ireland and for % of services inflows to Northern Ireland, the report states. For trade from Ireland, Northern Ireland accounts for slightly less than % of total services exports from Ireland. This reflects the relatively small size of the Northern Ireland economy and the highly export-orientated and FDI-dominated structure of Ireland’s services sector. In terms of the balance of trade, the report found that more services are exported from Northern Ireland to Ireland relative to those from Ireland to Northern Ireland. Examining the characteristics of services firms active in cross-border trade, the report finds that exporting firms in services are systemically larger and more productive than non-exporters. The author of the report, professor Martina Lawless, said: “The patterns identied in this report suggest that there is considerable scope for expansion of cross-border trade in services. “The monitoring of the effectiveness of trade support policies would be greatly improved by expanding and coordinating the information collected on cross-border services flows.” This second research report provides novel evidence on factors and policies underlying the attractiveness of Ireland and Northern Ireland to FDI in high-value knowledge-intensive sectors.      This research also explores opportunities for policy coordination and cooperation on the island of Ireland that could enhance the attractiveness of both jurisdictions to high-value FDI. The research finds that FDI in high-value sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland accounts for substantial shares of all new greenfield FDI projects. At over %, these shares are higher than the corresponding averages for Great Britain and the EU countries. Speaking ahead of the launch of the reports, Tanaiste Leo Varadkar, said: “We commissioned this research to provide a high-quality evidence base for looking, in real terms, at how we could do more, and do better together, across both parts of this island. “How we could align better, levelling up and taking the best of both jurisdictions. “The research shows that there is much more scope to ‘think all-island’ when it comes to the services economy and attracting foreign direct investment, accruing economic and societal benefits both North and South.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

The low share of services in trade flows from Ireland to Northern Ireland is in contrast with the high overall services content of Ireland’s exports to other markets, ESRI report stated. Ireland is one of the main markets for services trade from Northern Ireland.   The reports, published on Tuesday, assess cross-border trade in services and “enhancing the attractiveness of the island of Ireland” to high-value foreign direct investment . The first of the set of economic reports examines the extent of cross-border trade in services on the island of Ireland and the characteristics of the firms participating in this trade. The main services traded include transportation and storage, business services and computer consultancy. Sales to Ireland account for % of services outflows from Northern Ireland and for % of services inflows to Northern Ireland, the report states. For trade from Ireland, Northern Ireland accounts for slightly less than % of total services exports from Ireland. This reflects the relatively small size of the Northern Ireland economy and the highly export-orientated and FDI-dominated structure of Ireland’s services sector. In terms of the balance of trade, the report found that more services are exported from Northern Ireland to Ireland relative to those from Ireland to Northern Ireland. Examining the characteristics of services firms active in cross-border trade, the report finds that exporting firms in services are systemically larger and more productive than non-exporters. The author of the report, professor Martina Lawless, said: “The patterns identied in this report suggest that there is considerable scope for expansion of cross-border trade in services. “The monitoring of the effectiveness of trade support policies would be greatly improved by expanding and coordinating the information collected on cross-border services flows.” This second research report provides novel evidence on factors and policies underlying the attractiveness of Ireland and Northern Ireland to FDI in high-value knowledge-intensive sectors.      This research also explores opportunities for policy coordination and cooperation on the island of Ireland that could enhance the attractiveness of both jurisdictions to high-value FDI. The research finds that FDI in high-value sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland accounts for substantial shares of all new greenfield FDI projects. At over %, these shares are higher than the corresponding averages for Great Britain and the EU countries. Speaking ahead of the launch of the reports, Tanaiste Leo Varadkar, said: “We commissioned this research to provide a high-quality evidence base for looking, in real terms, at how we could do more, and do better together, across both parts of this island. “How we could align better, levelling up and taking the best of both jurisdictions. “The research shows that there is much more scope to ‘think all-island’ when it comes to the services economy and attracting foreign direct investment, accruing economic and societal benefits both North and South.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Butwe were all truly honest, isn’t it the side dishes we’re actually looking forward to most  googletag.cmd.push Pigs in blankets, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, roasted parsnips, stuffing… these tasty jewels beside the golden bird are arguably the best bit. We asked some celeb chefs and food writers to share their favourite festive sides, with tips for how to cook them too… . Ruby Tandoh adores a Yorkshire pudding       “My favourite side dish has to be the Yorkshire pudding,” says Tandoh, author of new cookbook, Cook As You Are. “Whether or not it’s strictly canon depends on who you’re speaking to, but I can’t imagine a better vessel for mopping up gravy. It’s the perfect counterpoint to the meaty savouriness of the Christmas dinner plate.” . Gordon Ramsay has very specic thoughts on stuffing      “Stuffing’s something that people think needs to be stuffed in the cavity of the turkey – that’s the worst place to cook a stuffing. It’s not good in there. There’s a reason why you don’t put much in that cavity,” says Ramsay, whose new recipe collection, Ramsay In , is out now.“To make a really good stuffing is something I do separately. And so, I get the ground sausage, the pork, the beef. And then from there we’ll put in some smoked pancetta, some beautully roasted pistachios, some chopped up apricot and bake it in the tray prior. And then as it comes out, we’ll add some resting juices from the turkey and let it sit and absorb.” . Donal Skehan appreciates the humble Brussels sprout…     “Brussels sprouts are my favourite. I love them every way,” say Irish chef Skehan, author of Everyday Cook. “I love them as a salad as well. Very much a winter salad – in a food processor, bag of sprouts, straight down the chute into the chopper, mix it together with some really good chunks of Pecorino cheese, and some dried cranberries or even pomegranate, would be lovely. And then just a light dressing and some nuts maybe as well, something to crunch, toasted walnuts would be nice. Youmix that together and it’s like a Brussel’s sprout slaw, but it is stunning.” . Same goes for River Cottage’s Lucy Brazier       “Sprouts with chestnuts, because I think that tastes like Christmas,” says food writer Lucy Brazier, whose new cookbook, Christmas at River Cottage, is all about the festive food season. “I could eat a bowl of that without anything .” . Gino D’Acampo gets excited about the roasted veg       “I’m a huge roasted vegetable fan at Christmas,” says the chef, celebrating his new series and cookbook, Gino’s Italian Family Adventure. “We do them with balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, parsley, a few capers, all these – amazing. Funnily enough I do like stuffing, because what is stuffing, sausage with herbs and a bit of bread  Very tasty, I like that. I hate Turkey. I don’t like turkey.” . James Martin has a buttery way with carrots       Chef James Martin loves carrots cooked in butter – Butter being the title of his new cookbook. He does them “in a style of Vichy – Vichy is a town in the south of France. They cook everything in mineral water, sugar, butter and salt to produce this amazing taste, butyou use the addition of star anise it makes carrots taste amazing.” . Mary Berry champions the good old celeriac       “I love celeriac,” says Mary Berry . “I just cook it until it’s soft. It’s knobbly. If you grow it, it doesn’t come to fruition until November. You can buy it earlier. And I cook it until it’s tender then add full-fat cregraveme fresh to it and puree it. It is delicious. It reheats well.” She also makes chestnut stuffing. “I do them the day before and I do it in small shapes and fry them, then all I’ve got to do is reheat them.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

And they’re not alone – the research found a thirdof grandparents buy unsuitable gts for grandchildren at Christmas, closely followed by aunties , distant relativesand friends .  By asking yourself a few simple questions you can nail the art of gt-giving to both children and adults, promises Kim Brookes, who ran an online gt-registry for more than  years.   Have kids so that instead of real gts you can give friends and family novelty photo items with pictures of your children they saw on social media  months ago. — Some Boys MotherDecember ,    “Now’s the time to show your family just how much you love them by way of the perfect gt,” she says. “This is an opportunity not to be squandered, but one that causes a lot of stress at this time of year, as we really want to get it right.” Brookes, who now runs the natural scent jewellery brand, Perfino, suggests people choosing gts ask themselves these questions… . Do they really need it   Think about the person you’re buying for. You want to give them something that’s meaningful, not just for Christmas. Something that won’t be part of the re-gting cycle any time soon. So, it needs to be something they really want, rather than a short-term fad. “Subscriptions are a good option for this,” says Brookes. “Perhaps a comic or magazine – a gt that reminds them of you every month.” . Just because you love it, does that mean they will  Remember who you’re buying for and always keep their tastes and preferences at the forefront of your mind. “They may not want the chemistry set when their favourite subject is art, or the history book when they love nothing better than a murder mystery,” stresses Brookes.  . Have you really put proper thought into it  Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s there, without giving any thought to the person you’re buying for, says Brookes. “This is the worst offence,” she insists, “as it shows little consideration. Try to find some time to think long and hard about the child or person you’re buying for, and you’ll know what’ll make them happy, evenit’s not to your taste. Thankfully we’re all dferent.” . Have you gone too big    Brookes points out that while a gt recipient might love a trip to an adventure park for Christmas, and be a bit put out with a stick of deodorant, you’ll have a sense of what’s right. “And be very careful not to escalate,” she warns, “as you’ll be digging a hole for yourself on future gting occasions.” . Is it really eco-friendly  This question now has to be at the front of everyone’s minds, for your own satisfaction as well as the good of the planet, says Brookes. “I find the easiest way to do this is to trust who you’re buying from,” she says. “Most businesses will now put their eco credentials front and centre and,they don’t, look for one that does. Once you trust them, you can buy with an easy conscience.” . Have they already got it  If a potential gt is new and super-popular, it’s possible your gt recipient may already have it. If the gt’s for your own child, there’s a chance someone  may have bought it for them. “The best way forward could be to make some subtle enquiries,” advises Brookes, “andyou take the leap and buy, at least keep the receipt and be upfront about how happy you’d be to facilitate an exchange.”  . Are consumables a good choice   “We have so much at this time of year, so I’d avoid more chocolate, more sweets, more of anything unless it’s an extra-special treat – something they wouldn’t normally have, but which you know they’d enjoy,” suggests Brookes. . Are smellies always a winner  Smelly oils, creams etc may work for older children, teenagers and adults – but onlyyou know they like that sort of thing, warns Brookes, who says that, again, such items need to be really special to be a good gt. “Bath oil is my favourite thing,” she says, “but obviously it’s not for someone who only takes showers.” . Is it really appropriate  Consider whether something is age-appropriate for children and, of course, avoid anything made from plastic, stresses Brookes. . Is it going to look fabulous under the tree   It’s a minor consideration, but Brookes saysyou make the unwrapping experience a joyful one it can add that little bit of lovely Christmas sparkle to yourgt. “Ribbons, fabric, or even a drop of festive essential oil on the wrapping paper always work wonders,” she adds.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Owner of Ferry Clever, Christopher Ferry, said he believed it was more important than ever to shop local this Christmas. “Everything was in lockdown and a lot of small local businesses really got affected by that. I think this is probably the most important year ever regarding supporting local because a lot of businesses really struggled to get back on their feet after being closed for so long. “I think that people realise that, and they are really going all out this year to support local. A small business like myself doesn’t take it for granted, I really appreciate it and I would just really push to support local this year especially. Big operators like Amazon can be handy but your small spend makes a giant dference.” Ben Allen, owner of local record store ‘Abbazappa,’ spoke of the benefits of choosing to shop local. “I know my customers. I know them by name, they know me. The thing about a record shop is when a customer is with you evenit’s only for a few minutes, you’re that person’s best friend and you can talk about music, recommend things, and talk about all sorts. That doesn’t happen online. Online is completely soulless.  Ben Allen, proprietor of Abbazappa.  “The greatest thing on earth is being able to look through the products in the likes of a record shop or book shop physically. It’s a pleasure to do that. You can pick it up and seethe products okay before buying it. You can’t do that online, it’s a bit of a lucky dip.” Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA, Paacutedraig Delargy, also urged the people of Derry to support local businesses this year. “On the back of the voucher scheme, we’re encouraging everybody to spend their pound in local businesses as it’s been such a tough couple of months for them. Anything that can be done to make sure these businesses get back on their feet, we need to do it and make sure we can support our local high street shops.” The new Ferry Clever store can be found at - Bishops Street, and Abbazappa Records can be found at the Yellow Yard on Palace Street.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Mr Durkan had long lobbied for the provision to be removed and worked alongside a number of charities to get Sinn Feacutein Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, to change the current provision. The Social SecurityBill was granted accelerated passage at its second stage in the Assembly on Tuesday. Foyle MLA Mr Durkan said: “I have long campaigned for this cruel and unnecessary measure to be changed. To ask people who have been given a terminal illness diagnosis to jump through hoops in order to access help and support is unconscionable. That we are not doing everything we can to make things easier for those suffering from illness in the final months of their lives is callous in the extreme. “Through my work with Marie Curie on this issue I was made aware of one family that received a letter declaring their brother was fit for work on the very day of his funeral. This should never have been allowed to happen and I hope this legislation will go some way to preventing that and get those suffering from terminal illness the quick and easy access to welfare they deserve – it’s the least we can do. “The extension of this provision to people with a year to live is welcome and will help many, but it doesn’t go far enough. I would urge Minister Hargey to take a leaf from the Scottish Government’s book and consider permitting clinicians to make the call on determining whether their patients are terminally ill without worrying about arbitrary time limits.  “People living with Motor Neurones Disease, Multiple Sclerosis and other le limiting illnesses won’t obtain a better prognosis. For them, a six-month extension wont make much of a dference and will just add to unnecessary stress at this awful time. We should be focused on support for people who have received this devastating diagnosis and their families, not judging peoples need to access help based on the time they have left.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

We need to seize the potential for economic growth created by the protocol and to take the opportunity that is coming to help shape a new Ireland with support for reunication now stronger than ever and growing every day.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

The discovery of a new iant may also present new challenges so I would urge the Minister to revisit her approach to COVID in schools. High Efficiency Particulate Air filters remove contaminants such as viruses from the air, reducing airborne transmission in classrooms with poor ventilation. “It is clear that HEPA filtration is one of a number of mitigations which could help make our classrooms safer. “The Minister has dithered and delayed on ventilation for too long. It is crunch time for our schools. I am calling on the Minister today, to act urgently to examine the provision of HEPA air filtration for all of our classrooms. “The Minister keeps telling us she wants to keep schools open. We agree, but she has to be willing to do what it takes and that means HEPA filters in all of our classrooms, not just some ofthem.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Almost two-thirdsof internet users aged  to  years refused use of their personal data for advertising purposes, compared with % of persons in the  to  years age group Only % of people said they read a website’s privacy policy statement before providing personal information online.  Ms Delamere said: “As our internet usage continues to increase, so too does the amount of personal information and data which is made available online. “In , almost six in internet users restricted access to their geographical location when using online s, while nearly six in internet users refused allowing the use of personal data for advertising purposes. “Internet users were less likely, however, to limit access to their profile or content on social networking sites or shared online storage, with just under halfof internet users limiting such access.” She added: “Websites that collect personal information require a privacy policy statement, but only % of internet users read them before providing personal information online. “Similarly, even though everyone has the right to access the digital personal data collected by websites or search engines administrator or providers, just % of internet users requested access to their online personal data to update or delete it.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

The National Archiveswill present an exhibition thatmarks itsrole as the official repository of the recordsof the State, one hundred years since its formation. The Treaty, : Records fromthe Archivesopens up signicant historical records, official documents, and private papers for the first time, includingthe first public presentation of both the Irish and British copies of the Treaty document. The exhibition locatesthe Treaty negotiations in the political context of the Irish revolution beginning with the exploratorytalks betweenEacuteamon de Valera and David Lloyd George during the summer of , itdetailsthe work of the Irish plenipotentiaries and their secretariat, by presenting the documentary record that they left behind.  The exhibition also chronicles day-to-day le in London for the men and women who made up the Irish delegation, from parties attended,dinners hosted and appearances at theatre and gala performances, to the tense final days and hours leading to the signing of the Treaty just after am on  December . Finally, it documents the delegation’sto Dublin, and the Daacuteil Eacuteireann cabinetmeeting that pointed to the split in the independence movement that emerged over the terms of the Treaty, and the isions that wouldlead to Civil War. Speaking at the exhibition, Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said thisis a signicant exhibition bringing key records relating to the foundation of the State to the public for the first time in  years. These records highlight this complex period in our history culminating in the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . They present the dficult political context in which the Treaty was negotiated but they also open a window for the first time into the world in which the Irish delegation operated during their time in London. It is an honour for me as Taoiseach to attend this exhibition. he added. Taacutenaiste Leo Varadkar said the Treaty was a decisive moment in history, an agreement negotiated in good faith between two opposing sides. This exhibition provides a vital connection to the foundation of our State, reminding us of the dramatic events of one hundred years ago, and the courageous decisions which enabled us to achieve a priceless stepping stone to freedom. he added. The National Archives wasestablished to collect, manage and preserve Ireland’s public record, ensuring their availability as a resource for all. These records relate to the social, cultural, economic and political history of the island of Ireland from the Middle Ages through to the establishment of the Irish Free State in  and into the modern era. Admission to the exhibition is free. Book online at here. This exhibition is presented as part of the Government of Ireland’s Decade of Centenaries - National Programme. It runs from December ,  - March ,  from am-pm daily.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

The National Archiveswill present an exhibition thatmarks itsrole as the official repository of the recordsof the State, one hundred years since its formation. The Treaty, : Records fromthe Archivesopens up signicant historical records, official documents, and private papers for the first time, includingthe first public presentation of both the Irish and British copies of the Treaty document. The exhibition locatesthe Treaty negotiations in the political context of the Irish revolution beginning with the exploratorytalks betweenEacuteamon de Valera and David Lloyd George during the summer of , itdetailsthe work of the Irish plenipotentiaries and their secretariat, by presenting the documentary record that they left behind.  The exhibition also chronicles day-to-day le in London for the men and women who made up the Irish delegation, from parties attended,dinners hosted and appearances at theatre and gala performances, to the tense final days and hours leading to the signing of the Treaty just after am on  December . Finally, it documents the delegation’sto Dublin, and the Daacuteil Eacuteireann cabinetmeeting that pointed to the split in the independence movement that emerged over the terms of the Treaty, and the isions that wouldlead to Civil War. Speaking at the exhibition, Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said thisis a signicant exhibition bringing key records relating to the foundation of the State to the public for the first time in  years. These records highlight this complex period in our history culminating in the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . They present the dficult political context in which the Treaty was negotiated but they also open a window for the first time into the world in which the Irish delegation operated during their time in London. It is an honour for me as Taoiseach to attend this exhibition. he added. Taacutenaiste Leo Varadkar said the Treaty was a decisive moment in history, an agreement negotiated in good faith between two opposing sides. This exhibition provides a vital connection to the foundation of our State, reminding us of the dramatic events of one hundred years ago, and the courageous decisions which enabled us to achieve a priceless stepping stone to freedom. he added. The National Archives wasestablished to collect, manage and preserve Ireland’s public record, ensuring their availability as a resource for all. These records relate to the social, cultural, economic and political history of the island of Ireland from the Middle Ages through to the establishment of the Irish Free State in  and into the modern era. Admission to the exhibition is free. Book online at here. This exhibition is presented as part of the Government of Ireland’s Decade of Centenaries - National Programme.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain. Kevin travelled to Istanbul last month to meet a specialist and will require surgery within a matter of months, which will cost in the region of pound,.

On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Liam Tunney Dec Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, Derrys Competitions Control Committeehas vowed to clamp down on the number of clubs moving fixtures for the  season. googletag.cmd.push In their report to the Derry GAA AGM, the CCC said that of  games played during the  season,  games had been moved away from their original date. The figure excludes changes made before the beginning of the season to accommodate club requests, and the CCCs report said clubs need to stick to the deadline for making changes. “A weekly fixtures list is sent to clubs and any changes for the incoming week should be notied by the given deadline,” they said. “There is a tendency for club managers to agree last minute changes among themselves, sometimes not even informing their club secretary. “The original referee is not always available for the changed date time and this is a headache for our Referee Administrator. “In  as per CCC policy there will be NO game changes accepted after Sunday night for the week ahead unless in exceptional circumstances.” Dungiven picked up the U Jack Cassidy Cup in , but the CCC have raised concerns about the age grade. Pic by Mary K Burke. Elsewhere in the report, the Committee stressed the need to take another look at the bridging competition between underage and senior, saying the U grade did not work well. They also urged clubs to be honest in choosing their grade, and said there were reports of players prevented from attending to ensure lower-sided games. “We ask clubs to ensure that they work with managers and team personnel when choosing the grade they enter for  , and that they aim to play  a side including all eligible players,” the report said. “There were worrying reports that some players were being told they were not needed on a given night to ensure a  a side game. “This should NOT be happening and especially not in the current climate when sporting activity is more important than ever.” Discipline has continued to be an issue, with figures provided by the CCC revealing one club had had  incidents dealt with during . The report indicated the CCC would deal with issues in the strictest manner possible. Our games are contact sports and accidental injury will inevitably happen, but a deliberate attack on an opponent or official, causing serious injury is inexcusable, and the fear is that one of these days something will go badly wrong, with terrible consequences for all involved, said the report. We need to hammer home to our players the danger of the one punch attack and instil in them a healthy respect for their opponents and officials. The disregard for the authority of referees, and the abuse directed at them, especially from young players gives rise for concern. These remain UNACCEPTABE and we will continue to deal with them in the strictest manner possible.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Liam Tunney Dec Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, Derrys Competitions Control Committeehas vowed to clamp down on the number of clubs moving fixtures for the  season. googletag.cmd.push In their report to the Derry GAA AGM, the CCC said that of  games played during the  season,  games had been moved away from their original date. The figure excludes changes made before the beginning of the season to accommodate club requests, and the CCCs report said clubs need to stick to the deadline for making changes. “A weekly fixtures list is sent to clubs and any changes for the incoming week should be notied by the given deadline,” they said. “There is a tendency for club managers to agree last minute changes among themselves, sometimes not even informing their club secretary. “The original referee is not always available for the changed date time and this is a headache for our Referee Administrator. “In  as per CCC policy there will be NO game changes accepted after Sunday night for the week ahead unless in exceptional circumstances.” Dungiven picked up the U Jack Cassidy Cup in , but the CCC have raised concerns about the age grade. Pic by Mary K Burke. Elsewhere in the report, the Committee stressed the need to take another look at the bridging competition between underage and senior, saying the U grade did not work well. They also urged clubs to be honest in choosing their grade, and said there were reports of players prevented from attending to ensure lower-sided games. “We ask clubs to ensure that they work with managers and team personnel when choosing the grade they enter for  , and that they aim to play  a side including all eligible players,” the report said. “There were worrying reports that some players were being told they were not needed on a given night to ensure a  a side game. “This should NOT be happening and especially not in the current climate when sporting activity is more important than ever.” Discipline has continued to be an issue, with figures provided by the CCC revealing one club had had  incidents dealt with during . The report indicated the CCC would deal with issues in the strictest manner possible. Our games are contact sports and accidental injury will inevitably happen, but a deliberate attack on an opponent or official, causing serious injury is inexcusable, and the fear is that one of these days something will go badly wrong, with terrible consequences for all involved, said the report. We need to hammer home to our players the danger of the one punch attack and instil in them a healthy respect for their opponents and officials. The disregard for the authority of referees, and the abuse directed at them, especially from young players gives rise for concern. These remain UNACCEPTABE and we will continue to deal with them in the strictest manner possible. We will implement whatever measures we need to protect players and officials and work to ensure our games are safer and more enjoyable for all. In his secretarys report to the AGM, Peter Keane said Derry was in a good place both on and off the field of play. He said the county was close to appointing their full time Head of Operations. “The County Executive will announce the appointment of a fulltime Head of Operations in the coming days,” said the report. “When we look at what has happened over the past couple of years which can be put down to a dedicated and hardworking Committee of volunteers backed up by determined sub-committees then this appointment can only lead to further development both on and off the pitch. “The appointee will have leadership skills, financial expertise, strategic planning skills, marketing skills -all attributes that will help Derry to achieve their objectives in the next few years.” The report also said Derry were in a fairly good financial position, pointing to the recent acquisition of a new sponsor and a number of appointments yet to come.

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too.

Together we can put a stop to illegal puppy farming. Buying a puppy from illegal breeders can have devastating results, she continued.ldquoOften puppies die a short time after purchase or end up with infectious diseases such as parvovirus which is expensive to treat and, often fatal. They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13274193.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe complaint to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales against the Cardf and Vale University Health Board was lodged by the patient -referred to in the complaint as lsquoMr Drsquo -who was unhappy with the care and treatment he received at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf during and after a scheduled admission for surgery to remove the right side of his colon.Mr D, who has Aspergerrsquos Syndrome, complained that hiscondition - at the time believed to be Crohns Disease -was not clearly diagnosed and that clinicians were slow to identy he suffered a post-operative bleed and needed further emergency surgery.He complained that information about his treatment and care was not provided clearly to him despite those caring for him knowing about his Aspergerrsquos Syndrome. He was also unhappy with aspects of his care after his discharge.Mr Drsquos surgery was carried out on the presumption that he had Crohnrsquos Disease according to the Ombudsman, but surgical findings suggested complex chronic appendicitis.The Ombudsman found that neither of these conditions needed the extensive surgery that Mr D was given. The Ombudsman also found there was no complete record of how his condition was monitored following his surgery and that his post-operative bleed might have been detected sooner.The Ombudsman also concluded that the clinicians were aware of the patientrsquos Aspergerrsquos Syndrome but did not clearly communicate the information about his diagnosis and treatment to him. The Ombudsman also found that the patient was not seen by a mental health clinician as requested by Mr D because it was not arranged.MORE NEWS:The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint regarding Mr Drsquos care post-discharge.Nick Bennett of Public Services Ombudsman for Wales said: ldquoThis regrettable case highlights yet again the importance of one of the key principles of prudent healthcare formulated by the Welsh Government ndash lsquodo only what is needed and do no harm.rsquoldquoPhysicians responsible for Mr Drsquos care should have employed a lsquowatch and waitrsquo approach in which his condition would probably have settled without surgical treatment.ldquoInstead, Mr D, a vulnerable inidual, faced completely avoidable trauma of unnecessary surgery and post-treatment complications ndash a trauma which saw him seek mental health support. I anticipate that my findings will be extremely distressing for him. This is reflected in my recommendations in this case.The Ombudsman recommended that Cardf and Vale University Health Board provides Mr D with a detailed apology and a redress payment of pound,. Mr Bennett also recommended that the physicians and nurses involved in Mr Drsquos care have relevant training in the management of Crohnrsquos Disease and chronic appendicitis as well as the care and management of patients with Aspergerrsquos Syndrome.It was also recommended that the nursing team consider the importance of conducting and documenting post-operative observations and of preparing accurate and relevant care plans.The Ombudsmans report says Cardf and Vale University Health Board has accepted the findings and conclusions of the Ombudsmanrsquos report and has agreed to implement the recommendations.A spokesperson for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: \"As a health board we would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr D for the concerns identied in the report.\"We are implementing the recommendations from the Ombudsman and an improvement plan has been developed to monitor the delivery of all recommendations within the agreed timescales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityExactly how fast the city should grow is up for debate as Cardf council launches a major consultation on its local development plan.Another issue is how many of these new homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.The development plan is a hugely important council document shaping how the city will evolve until , and the consultation runs for  weeks until February .The first phase of the consultation looks at how many new homes and jobs the city might need over the next  years, with three specic options. Currently developers already have plans for an extra , homesmdashwhich havenrsquot yet been builtmdashthanks to the existing local development plan.Although, itrsquos possible that not all of these will actually be built. Some additional lsquowindfall sitesrsquo are also likely to come forward, where developers build homes not allocated in the development plan.So factoring these in, the first option would mean an extra , homes needed, as well as , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , by .The second option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This could mean more affordable housing.The third option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This is based on population growth projections from the previous development plan, which some critics say were too high.Councillor Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: ldquoThe replacement LDP is going to shape the look and feel of Cardf for years to come, so it was really important for us to hear as wide a range of views as possible. At this stage of the process, we are accessing a number of dferent scenarios on the possible levels of growth in Cardf up to , and the need for houses to be built to accommodate this growth..removeldquoIt is important that people understand the consequences of the options, as most growth scenarios will have pros and cons with regard to important issues such as land for employment opportunities, the impact on the environment, addressing housing need, supporting the delivery of community and transport infrastructure, and how many truly affordable homes that could be provided.People can respond to the consultation by visiting the website https:cardfldp.consultation.ai, while there will also be focus groups to gather views of people who donrsquot normally respond to council consultations.The next phase of the consultation explores eight options on how the city should accommodate a growing population, and how many homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.Option one would extend the existing strategic sites, built on countryside on the outskirts of the city. This would mean more affordable homes and a wider range of housing, due to the cheaper construction costs of building on greenfield sites.Options two and three would see new homes built mostly on urban brownfield sites, meaning land which has already been developed. This would mean denser housing, and could be more expensive to build with less range in size. Option four is similar, but focusing on building around existing district centres to create a lsquocity of villagesrsquo concept.Option five would see new homes built around existing transport links in urban areas while option six would focus growth around proposed transport improvements like the metro and planned new train stations, including on some greenfield sites.Option seven would focus on greenfield sites not already earmarked for development, on countryside on the outskirts of Cardf. Option eight would be a mix of using greenfield and brownfield sites, in urban areas and the countryside, to get the best of both.Cllr Wild added: ldquoAt this stage of the process, all of the options that are presented in the consultation are potential options, rather than preferred options. The preferred strategy could combine a number of these options together. All of the feedback from the public will be considered, alongside further technical work, which will help the council prepare the preferred strategy that will be consulted on with the public in autumn .This consultation follows a previous one held earlier this year, which focused on what the broader goals of the replacement development plan should look like. This included exploring how the city should face problems like coronavirus and the climate crisis. The final plan is expected to be approved in October . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

the Foreign Office.ldquoThe evidence wersquove heard today points to a lack of leadership, urgency and adequate resourcing.It comes after awkward questions were posed of both the Prime Minister and his deputy Dominic Raab by a whistleblower testimony given to the committee.Former official Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office during the effort, claimed that just % of Afghan

holiday on the Greek island of Crete until August  ndash three days after Sir Laurie had flagged that Afghanistan was falling quicker than anticipated.Mr Raab also came in for criticism as part of Mr
