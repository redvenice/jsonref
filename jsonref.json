The fair has gone from dusty irrelevance during a long sojourn in the suburbs to a glittering fixture on the art world calendar.London galleries are launching new spaces in Paris, and US dealerships, who would once have chosen London as their European base, are going to Paris instead. Is it the Brexit effect? The Macron effect? Or is it simply that with a revitalised art fair rivalling Frieze for international clout, a vibrant gallery scene, a growing number of serious young collectors and world-class museums, Paris is having a moment?In February 2018 the Los Angeles gallery Freedman Fitzpatrick opened a second space near the Hotel de Ville because, says its co-director Robbie Fitzpatrick, “over four years exhibiting at FIAC we realised we were making our highest number of sales outside the US in France, both to private collectors and institutions”.They are not the only ones. On Wednesday, FIAC’s preview day and private viewing, David Zwirner inaugurates his first continental outpost in the 8,600sq ft space once occupied by the famed French gallerist Yvon Lambert. Meanwhile, White Cube has announced it will open offices and a viewing room on Avenue Matignon early next year, and rumour has it that Pace Gallery and Hauser \u0026amp Wirth are “looking”. Neither will confirm or deny this, but both sent ambiguous emails when asked. “As always, we would need the perfect combination of the right strategy, opportunity and passion,” wrote Iwan Wirth. “Ultimately, we remain completely committed to being embedded in London’s vibrant cultural scene that will not change.”Tova Ossad, who founded the consultancy Ossad Art Management this year, does not think Paris will replace London. “I don’t see it. There’s too much to unravel. London’s roots are too deep, and it is so international – you have Asia, the US and the Middle East. But galleries that identify as European may want to open there. And that’s good for us both – two thriving markets working together.”All the galleries coming from London emphasise its significance as a global art hub and while most concede that Brexit is a factor in their move across the Channel, it is not the only reason.Mathieu Paris, senior director of White Cube in London for the past six years, is returning to his native city to run the new space. “This is absolutely not an emergency solution to the political situation,” he says. “The fact is that for the last seven years Paris has been back on the map.“It was always a city for artists and collectors but there was a decline after the second world war. You can really feel its renaissance now and we want to tap into the French tradition of the marchand d’art, showing great masterpieces in an intimate, discreet way from a beautiful Haussmann apartment in a prestigious area.”German-born Zwirner has said that identity is central to his decision, telling the Financial Times: “Brexit changes the game. After October my London gallery will be a British gallery, not a European one. I am European, and I would like a European gallery too.”Glenn Scott-Wright’s assertion that in these times of uncertainty “everybody needs a European base” seems to be the general consensus. Scott-Wright, co-director of Victoria Miro Gallery, says he sees “a definite shift towards Paris”.Paris’s fashion and luxury-goods houses are intrinsic to the art scene. There is huge excitement over the “home-coming” of Pinault whose two magnificent Venice art spaces look set to be eclipsed by his $170m contemporary art museum set to open in Paris next June. to the Louvre des Antiquaires building opposite the Louvre, in 2024, will transform a dreary tourist parade into a booming contemporary art centre. And Arnault’s Fondation Louis Vuitton has produced a stunning run of exhibitions over the past four years.As part of FIAC’s Hors les Murs programme which places outdoor artworks in public spaces, Victoria Miro has collaborated with David Zwirner and Ota Fine Arts to commission a vast Kusama installation for Place Vendôme. “Kusama says no to an awful lot,” says Scott-Wright, “but she couldn’t say no to this. Paris holds tremendous allure for artists.”Emin agrees. “It’s an antidote to everything we don’t like in the world right now: the beauty of the city, the fact that you walk everywhere it feels artisanal, a place to reclaim your soul.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/214b4b807678a92db82b1b6149e6de9a9241b5cb/0_544_2458_1474/master/2458.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d56d8e754ef1c984e2274d200211bfa3","title":"david hockney letters gallery art stunt","story":"Acts of audacious self-promotion in the contemporary art world now tend to be linked to names such as Damien Hirst or Tracey Emin, the Young British Artists who grabbed public attention in the 1990s. But research in the archives of a Yorkshire gallery has revealed that in the 1960s a student called David Hockney was also capable of a bold stunt.The aspiring artist invited a leading light of the Yorkshire art scene to Skipton to see some of his first public paintings, according to a letter discovered by curators preparing an exhibition at the Hepworth Wakefield.“We were surprised by the confidence with which he writes and by the headed gallery notepaper he is using,” said curator Abi Shapiro, who is putting together the new show, which opens on 19 October, celebrating both the early work of Hockney and the art of the late Alan Davie, an artistic hero of Hockney’s formative years.In the previously unknown letter, scrawled by Hockney while he was studying at the Royal College of Art in London, the 23-year-old brazenly adopts the tone of an established artist and invites Helen Kapp, the curator of the Wakefield gallery, to see his work as if she were an old friend.Writing to the imposing Kapp, who he had previously met by chance and sold a ceramic “pot cat” to, Hockney sends a catalogue and suggests she should see the show. He “clean forgot”, he adds, that he had promised to make another cat for her brother.“I am afraid I have no more left and as I was to trying to cast another my rather badly made mould broke in pieces, so I cannot make any more,” he concludes.The curator politely declines, calling him David Hackney by mistake. She has, she says, no car and a bus journey over to Skipton would take too long.The show Hockney was mounting in Skipton in 1960 was one of two that Shapiro and her team now believe were his first entrepreneurial efforts.The young artist, who had studied at Bradford College of Art before starting at the RCA, had banded together with a few friends to put on a show in Skipton, but he also staged a bold solo show in the town earlier that year, ahead of a London show once thought to have been his first.In 1958, Hockney had heard Davie speak at the Wakefield gallery at the opening of a show celebrating the work of the older, Scottish artist. This encounter changed Hockney’s artistic ambitions and sent him in a new direction. He moved to London to study, discarding realist figurative painting, just as Davie had done, and instead making colourful, abstract and symbolic work.“Helen Kapp was an extraordinarily formidable woman,” said Shapiro. “She carried on the tradition of the gallery from the 1930s that they should exhibit and collect contemporary art quite a radical thing in a provincial gallery then. The major retrospective show that had made Davie’s name in 1958 is often thought to have opened at the Whitechapel Gallery in London, but it was actually here first and then it toured. Kapp’s show generated a great buzz and she got 1,300 people through the door in that first week in Wakefield.”Fifty of the works that featured in the Davie retrospective, including a three-metre-long painting, Creation of Man (1957), will be brought together again for the first time when the show opens this week. The career of Davie, who died five years ago, was ultimately overshadowed by Hockney’s international fame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02b906426a5acc195ba33c4538dffcf3d9d2b501/41_82_2895_1738/master/2895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5402775046213b525a012a03f1e9c454","title":"mathematicians blackboards academics photographer jessica wynne do not erase","story":"Another year, another wave of students trampling across autumn leaves, making their way to their first lectures heady with a cocktail of excitement, apprehension and a nasty hangover. But while every year brings new faces, one feature of the academic landscape remains ever-present: the huge, imposing blackboards.Now photographer Jessica Wynne, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, has thrown a spotlight on this workhorse of academic endeavour, travelling across the US and beyond to capture the blackboards of mathematicians.The result, a project called Do Not Erase, reveals the scribbles, workings and eureka moments of minds bursting with equations and theories, a paean to mental graft and the blackboards that display it. You can almost feel the tickle of dust in the nose, the thump of chalk on the board, the swish of a cuff brushing away a mistake.Wynne says the project came about after she got to know the mathematicians Amie Wilkinson and Benson Farb, both professors at the University of Chicago, and their academic friends during summers in Cape Cod.“I became fascinated by the people, the mathematicians, and then, when I was talking to them about their work, I realised that their thought process and what they do is extremely creative – and I never really thought about mathematics in that way,” says Wynne.“I thought the blackboards would be an interesting way to get a peek into their world,” she says.The project also struck a personal note. “My parents were teachers at a small New England boarding school and I grew up on the campus – I sort of grew up in a classroom,” she says.Visiting institutes around the world, from the US to France and Brazil, Wynne says she gives mathematicians a free rein as to what they draw. Their fields are erse, ranging from geometric topology to quantum mechanics.“For some of them, I wandered into lectures and some have been in their offices and they have done boards for me,” says Wynne, adding that she is just about to meet a mathematician at Yale University to photograph a blackboard that hasn’t been erased in three years. “He said, ‘I just keep adding to it,’” she says.That the subjects of her portraits are somewhat antiquated is no surprise. Wynne says she deliberately shunned whiteboards, or digital boards. “I like the timelessness about blackboards,” she says, adding that they are also intriguing for their capacity to show layer upon layer of working.Professor David Damanik, a mathematician at Rice University, who is among those featured, says he uses blackboards to build a narrative. “On the blackboard, it is easier to develop your story and your argument.”Wilkinson agrees. “Almost everyone in the maths department at the University of Chicago teaches at a blackboard. When we are working on a problem it is the best way, when you have more than two people for example, to show your ideas,” she says.It’s a process Wynne saw for herself when she joined Wilkinson on a trip to Paris and watched her work with her collaborators on a blackboard. “It is almost like this interesting dance or performance as you watch these mathematicians and it is really beautiful,” she says.The sheer size of blackboards, ranging from single wall affairs to extensive, multi-panel boards, is important. “It is this giant canvas,” says Wynne. “Seeing everything in one large piece, you can jump around on the board and connect pieces and take things away and add things... I haven’t seen any other tool or any other device that matches that experience.”“There are so many aspects to a blackboard that are so wonderful that just can’t be replaced by anything else,” says Wilkinson.Not that it hasn’t been tried. Wilkinson says there was a furore among mathematicians at one US university when the blackboards were stripped out and replaced with whiteboards. “You would remove the blackboards at University of Chicago over the faculty’s collective dead, rotting bodies,” she said, although she acknowledged that academics in some other disciplines, like computer science, are not averse to whiteboards, a medium she sometimes uses but dislikes for being harder to clean, and the hard to remove stains they leave on the skin.If working with chalk is alluring, so too are the boards themselves. “The ones in Paris were beautiful because they were so old and I really loved and appreciated the old slate, just as a material,” says Wynne, adding that the zigzag boards at Rice University, on which Damanik’s work is shown, produced a striking image. “His board was coming out at you, so it has this three-dimensional, almost disorienting feeling when you look at it,” she says.Damanik’s multi-board work, he tells me, explores how to understanding the time evolution of a quantum mechanical system, focusing on the importance of various mathematical features.“The way the chalk looks on the board I find to be very beautiful, but also knowing that there are other layers of meaning there,” says Wynne. “I also like the fact that what I am documenting will never be there again.”Wilkinson and Damanik say there are stories of lightbulb moments lost to an inadvertent duster, though it hasn’t happened to them. “When someone writes something particularly excellent, one tends to photograph it,” says Wilkinson.Do Not Erase will be published by Princeton Books in 2020 "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0141605499888a3bff75fcd75b0e2271307707e/215_1109_4219_2532/master/4219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16f94b75b8f4c59e639a370260f53fbc","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Extinction Rebellion demonstrations, protests in Hong Kong, Turkey’s military offensive against Kurdish forces and Simone Biles at the artistic gymnastics world championships – the past seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7d7ab1ec9d85b92a28ce2fb86d41cf3811dc9c0/0_311_5519_3311/master/5519.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71d70400567b98e582b2e114548658a7","title":"peter james on brighton dark history potential for sinister","story":"The crime writer on his love for the city by the sea that was known as ‘the murder capital of Europe’“Hale knew, before he had been in Brighton three hours, that they meant to murder him.”I owe so much to Graham Greene’s Brighton Rock. Not only did it inspire me to become a writer, it also revealed a new side of my hometown that to this day both fascinates and inspires me.I was born in the city and spent my youth, as many teenagers do, inside the wooden walls of Brighton Pier’s arcade. My favourite arcade machine was rather macabre – an old automaton of Marie Antoinette on the guillotine that would, on the insertion of a coin, relieve her of her head. It certainly foreshadowed my career as a crime writer.Brighton is much like the sea it borders, an ebbing and flowing place with a constant movement of people in and out, providing an ever-changing study for new characters. The modern incomers are mostly affluent young professionals, students and LGBT+ people attracted to the city for its beauty, vibrant atmosphere and erse culture.However, in the 1930s, it was not a place to escape to but rather a place to escape from, known as “The murder capital of Europe” – an unfortunate nickname that came about when three dismembered female bodies were discovered in the train station’s left-luggage lockers. To this day, it is the only place in the UK where a serving chief constable has ever been murdered. Henry Solomon was bludgeoned to death in 1844 while interviewing a man on suspicion of stealing a roll of carpet. The crime was so shocking that it caught the attention of Queen Victoria, who donated to the welfare fund for his widow and nine children.The more you know about the city’s dark history, the more you can see potential for the sinister in the everyday. The bustling, bohemian but claustrophobic Brighton Lanes lend themselves to a chase, the burnt-out skeleton of the West Pier is the ultimate melancholy view for a pensive antagonist, and the enduring outlandishness of the Royal Pavilion is the perfect place to juxtapose with an illicit deal.Surprisingly, Brighton has not been overwritten by other authors. Patrick Hamilton’s The West Pier and Greene’s Brighton Rock are the only novels to have delved in any depth into its criminal underbelly. This has left a lot of space for my own fictional underworld.It has played a massive part in shaping not just my characters but my own character. Many people feel constrained by their hometown and want to spread their wings but I still feel excited by Brighton – despite its sometimes grisly past.• The Secret of Cold Hill by Peter James is published by Macmillan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32eb393650a16a0eeb0f8ff1e175cfbbde9e0feb/75_0_2820_1692/master/2820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6307930edcc4bb8610b1b60d5dbc70f","title":"tell us about your eurostar experiences","story":"The international railway service celebrates 25 years since the first train travelled underneath the Channel.

The official receiver is still paying 931 staff to help with the wind down. But the Hayses now want to recruit around 2,500 of those who have lost their jobs, quadrupling the size of their business in the process.It’s a daunting prospect but the reality is that the couple behind this family-run operation, which unlike Thomas Cook is profitable and free of debt, are nobody’s fools.“My husband is a clever boy, he’s got a brain the size of an elephant,” says Irene, 65, who chairs the business.The evidence from the last few weeks – and their four decades in business – suggests she and her husband know exactly what they are doing. In the final stage of negotiations, they triumphed over two US private equity companies to take control of Thomas Cook’s high street network for an undisclosed sum.The eventual deal followed three weeks of day and night talks with government-appointed accountancy firm KPMG and estate agent Savills, who were armed with an army of lawyers.John and Irene had to provide evidence of their financial resilience to the Civil Aviation Authority, opening up Hays Travel’s books to rigorous stress testing.But the pair, who arrive unaccompanied by the usual public relations minders, acknowledge that for all their deal-making acuity, they are slightly different animals to the usual big beasts of industry.“There have been lots of stories about Thomas Cook being a bad example of capitalism – corporate greed, excessive overheads and excessive debt,” says John. “A lot of that is justified.“We’ve got a very different form of capitalism. We own the business between us, we’re owner-managers who empower our staff and we’ve got no debt.“We haven’t taken a idend for a while because we’re not skint. We’ve got a pleasant lifestyle but we don’t want yachts or anything.”Some of their own family members work for the business, although they’d rather not say who. And as the deal was being hammered out, they fretted not just about knotty contractual issues but also about the domestic harmony of their lead property lawyer.Her husband – a die-hard Newcastle United fan – had to miss his team’s unexpected victory over Manchester United to look after the children while she worked.“We were hoping they’d get hammered, so he’d say ‘Never mind pet, glad I missed it’,” says John, who was also presumably hoping Newcastle lost having served as vice-chairman of arch-rivals Sunderland AFC.As refreshing as their approach to their work might be, the feeling among some observers is that it may not be enough.The prevailing wisdom is that package holidays bought via a travel agent sitting behind a desk are a thing of the past in the internet age. In the immediate aftermath of Thomas Cook’s implosion, Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary declared the package holiday “dead”.Irene points to figures showing that the number of packages sold each year is actually rising, dismissing the language deployed by the Irish airline boss as “sloppy”.“He thinks it’s just a package holiday to Benidorm.”What Hays offers, the duo explain, could be a week in Benidorm, but it could also be a city break with opera tickets or a cruise up the Ganges complete with informative lectures, which is what they’re planning for their own Christmas break. They’re all packages of one sort of another.John says customers like the security afforded by the Atol scheme, which covers the cost of package deals when something goes wrong. As well as the benefit of such protection, he says tour operators such as Hays retain customers by going the extra mile.“The lightbulb moment was Hurricane Sandy, the snowstorm that closed New York for four days. We had about 1,000 clients there and we fed and watered them at our expense. One couple had a suite in the Waldorf Astoria and stayed on for an extra four days. It was eye-watering.”“They were one of the first people to be flown home, it has to be said,” Irene admits.While John is the tourism veteran, Irene – who has been chief executive of two local authorities and served as a government adviser for three years – is equally business-minded.She lists Hays’ advantages over Thomas Cook, including the absence of high fixed costs associated with things such as a glamorous headquarters and stock market listing.The management structure is also much flatter, with fewer steps of removal between the board and the shop floor. “Thomas Cook had a huge hierarchy, whereas we’re really close to our people,” she says. “I know people don’t think that can be done at scale, but it can.“We’ll hopefully sell more holidays than Thomas Cook too because we’re neutral about who we sell,” she adds, offering the example of Jet2, a holiday company whose packages the Thomas Cook agencies refused to offer.“There were people walking in wanting to book a holiday and Thomas Cook wouldn’t do it.”John acknowledges there is some surgery to do on Thomas Cook, whose brand was so tainted by the end that he wasn’t interested in buying the name to go along with the shops.There will be cost-cutting, some of it via renegotiation of rents with landlords, after a nine-month period in which lease agreements are locked in.There is also some duplication to address, with 49 Thomas Cook stores on the same street, or near, existing Hays outlets. “We’ve taken the view that we’ll run both shops on the same high street now and hopefully they’ll stay profitable,” he says.Some may close but he insists “there wouldn’t be job losses”.One of the ways in which Hays foster loyalty among their new staff is via a longstanding scheme to give shop staff a few hundred pounds to invest in local community projects. In one case, that involved funding a hedgehog hospital.“The kids didn’t like seeing the little hedgehogs limping along, or squashed, on their way to school,” Irene says.Those ex-Thomas Cook staff who join Hays are in for something a bit different."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90eb0e77ed2cb22b92ecf222d2802883c2d1a800/0_87_1003_602/master/1003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34a765ca7bf0436539448085d91278f6","title":"cocktails culture and craft beer a locals guide to canadas halifax and neighbouring regions","story":"The secret is out. Halifax and its surrounds are a laidback, coastal paradise where postcard perfect seaside towns and vibrant nightlife make for a good time, recommends local Jaime JacquesFoodies take note, a culinary boom is happening in Halifax right now, and the land is linked to everything. Visitors can expect to find ciders made with robust heritage apples, beers infused with locally grown blueberries, and of course, seafood everywhere, including some of the best lobsters to be found on the North American Atlantic coastline. The city is home to seven universities, and it’s got the youthful spirit to prove it. Breweries, cafes, live music and general levity can be found around every corner. Here are a few neighbourhoods and nearby regions that visitors shouldn’t miss to get a true taste of Canada’s most playful port city, a destination that’s only a six-hour flight from the UK.One of the city’s oldest neighbourhoods, the North End has been revived and transformed of late. The streets are an eclectic mix of colourful saltbox houses, old industrial warehouses and hip restaurants serving up craft beer, local wines and creative fare.For a casual afternoon pint in the summer, there’s nowhere better than the patio at Good Robot Brewing Company, where there is a rotating cast of all-star brews on the go and the vibe is always friendly and fun. The small but funky 2 Crows Brewing Co also has 12 taps and a brand new reveal every Saturday. Bar manager Mitch Gilbert recommends the Pollyanna Wild Northeast IPA, a juicy, tropical, bitter IPA that’s been flying off the shelves.“We propagate and grow our own yeast grains,” says Gilbert. “Then we add fruits sourced from Nova Scotia and malt from neighbouring Prince Edward Island. The results yield a quite extensive selection of barrel-aged beers.”For an unforgettable brunch, check out Edna, the bright and airy neighbourhood favourite, full of foraged wildflowers, a wide selection of beers and ciders, and some of the city’s best steaks, burgers and seafood. Later in the day, visit Field Guide – it’s just across the way and the perfect place to start off an evening. Try exquisitely crafted cocktails while enjoying the sharing menu that changes according to season.Popular with visitors and locals alike, Bar Kismet will complete your visit to Halifax, but you’ll need to book ahead or queue. Recently voted the 15th best restaurant in all of Canada, Bar Kismet gets everything right, nailing famous east-coast hospitality with stylish minimalism and exceptional seafood dishes. Award-winning bartender Cooper Tarel recommends the signature cocktail, Return of the Sumac, paired with the popular appetiser ahi tartare and allumettes fries.Finally, the hidden gem Water and Bone offers up rotating taps of all-local ciders and beers, excellent happy-hour specials, a sweet back patio and insanely popular noodle bowls (with house-made noodles).Citadel Hill strategically overlooks Halifax harbour and is what enticed the British military here in 1749. It’s worth a visit, and not only for the view from the top. From there, head downtown, stopping for a stroll in the Public Gardens. Don’t miss the amazing Halifax Central Library, a cultural hub with award-winning architecture and two excellent cafes inside.Head to Argyle Street for a bite or a pint or two after a day of exploring the city. The strip is one of Halifax’s nightlife hubs, where patios line both sides of the pedestrian-only zone. East of Grafton has a lovely little outdoor terrace that’s popular for lunch and alfresco dinner in the warmer months. Farther down, the elegant Lot Six stands out when it comes to local seafood dishes and cocktails, while The Five Fishermen offers up inspired seafood with an upscale casual atmosphere.For traditional east-coast nightlife, try Durty Nelly’s, while the Carleton is a must for live music in a cosy, friendly atmosphere.On the waterfront, a favourite place for a dinner date is The Bicycle Thief. Think incredible house-made pasta tossed with melt in your mouth scallops, sublime red wine and candlelit tables right beside the water. For afternoon pints by the water check out the Stubborn Goat Beer Garden where, as they say, beer tastes better by the ocean.Once at the Halifax waterfront, it’s easy to catch the ferry across the harbour to downtown Dartmouth, which is developing its own hip little collection of bars and restaurants. Heading up the local favourites is the wildly popular Canteen, conveniently located only steps away from the ferry terminal. There’s also the casual Battery Park, offering a slew of craft beers and home to Ace Burger Co, voted the best burgers in Halifax for several years running. For coffee, hit up Two If By Sea, the bright and friendly neighbourhood cafe that’s next door.Visitors to Halifax should also consider a trip to Nova Scotia’s wine country – it’s just an hour from the city. Leading the way is Lightfoot \u0026amp Wolfville Vineyards, a biodynamic, organic winery with strong Acadian roots. Owner Rachel Lightfoot’s family has been farming in the valley for eight generations, creating German-style wines including riesling and pinot noir.“For us, being in tune with the land means being constantly connected to the past and future generations,” she says. Lightfoot recommends trying their bestseller, the Terroir Series Scheurebe. “Nova Scotia’s ocean-influenced cool climate provides freshness and energy, melding with the inherent aromatic intensity of the scheurebe grape to create a truly unique wine,” she says.Another notable favourite is Luckett Vineyards. Pete Luckett is a transplanted Brit who emigrated to Nova Scotia and became a local celebrity. The restaurant is highly recommended, especially the charcuterie board. For beer lovers, Church Brewing Company offers an exceptional collection of craft beers and ciders and locally sourced hearty meals.The area surrounding Tatamagouche boasts several beaches, and because the Trans Canada Trail runs through it, visitors can walk, bike or run their way through town. The village, just under two hours from Halifax by car, is also home to the popular Tatamagouche Brewing Co. The brewery is inside the former village library, bought and reinvented by local craft beer enthusiast Christiane Jost.“The great thing about the beer scene here is that breweries are in every corner of this province,” she says. “We offer world-class beer with unique twists, using local ingredients.”Jost also recommends local restaurants Train Station Inn and the North Shore Diner. “They are both open seasonally, and create fresh food that showcases our local produce,” she says.The idyllic seaside villages of Mahone Bay, Peggy’s Cove, Chester and Old Town Lunenburg, a Unesco world heritage site, make up the south shore, and a scenic coastal drive to visit all four is one of the highlights of a visit to the region. For a self-guided tour, rent a car and enjoy the drive at your leisure, exploring the colourful seaside towns along the way. The area is peppered with local cafes, galleries and boutique shops, perfect for random stops. Over the years, there has also been a surge of creative cuisine along the route, focusing on fresh seafood, seasonal greens and berries, and of course, ciders and beer.Try starting out at The Barn in Mahone Bay or No9 Coffee Bar in Lunenburg for excellent food, coffee and ambience. For something more substantial, check out Grand Banker Bar and Grill for the famous Lunenburger, six ounces of local ground beef, topped with smoked mozzarella and bacon, spinach, Nova Scotia lobster and a bacon-wrapped scallop. If you still have room, check out the Grand Banker’s sister property Shipwright Brewing Company, for some more craft beer sampling.Start planning a trip to explore Halifax and its surrounds with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8e93db1382b05c5cdb62e3e08aa05f380590d2c/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=2500\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16cc39e61465ed4a4c220d22395e6220 5000w","title":"eat drink shop do the locals guide to victoria british columbia","story":"Victoria is home to a buzzing bar and dining scene, gorgeous waterfront vistas and one of the best bookshops in the world.

And as with any new city to explore, it is the local side of things that you’ll want to get acquainted with on your visit. So, where do Victorians go for the best cocktail, brunch, day trip or cultural fix? Read on to find out …Hot tourist spots such as FanTan Alley, the Parliament buildings and Fisherman’s Wharf are not to be missed from any Victoria trip itinerary, but making time for the smaller attractions is also important – and small is the very essence of the Victoria Bug Zoo, a two-room mini-zoo that will delight (and potentially disgust) visitors of all ages. Housing about 50 species of live tropical bugs to view and experience, the zoo’s friendly and knowledgeable tour guides will have even insectophobes seeing these creepy but fascinating critters in a new light.Speaking of insects, there are sure to be many hanging out at Butchart Gardens. In 1912, Jennie Butchart began transforming the former limestone quarry that made up her back yard into a beautiful sunken garden – and things escalated. Today, the gardens are a national historic site,  more than 22 hectares and showcase more than 900 types of plant, as well as a carousel, night illuminations, boat tours, firework displays, and an outdoor ice-skating rink in the winter. Whatever the season, this is one attraction worth adding to the itinerary. If you’re in the mood to take in one of the finest views in Victoria, then head to Mount Douglas Park lookout, which offers panoramic views of greater Victoria to the north and west, the Haro Strait to the east and downtown Victoria to the south.Rainy day, or just fancy resting your feet after a long day sightseeing? Mix things up and get your game face on, with a trip to Interactivity Board Game Cafe. It not only sells board games, but also has more than 800 available to sit and enjoy in-house.

Open daily, this slice of heaven features three heated outdoor mineral pools with breathtaking oceanfront views across the Salish Sea. When it comes to places to unwind, it doesn’t get much better than this.With more restaurants per capita than almost any other city in Canada, deciding where to eat in Victoria can be almost overwhelming – but you can’t really go wrong with The Tapa Bar. Friendly service and Spanish- and Mexican-inspired tapas dishes is the name of the game at this charming spot in Victoria’s historic Trounce Alley. Tuck yourself into the warm and inviting interior, or do it alfresco on the small patio – either is the perfect setting for washing down impeccable patatas bravas with a glass of sangria.If you’re looking for more of a unique dining experience, look no further than the 1888 heritage home turned restaurant, cafe and shop, Nourish Kitchen \u0026amp Cafe. Sure, it’s overlooking the inner harbour, but this isn’t a place that just relies on location – the seasonal menu is as fresh as it is delicious.The same is true of the more casual counter-serve cafe Part and Parcel. Don’t be put off by the slightly underwhelming exterior: exquisitely plated salads, sandwiches and mains, made with locally sourced ingredients, are a delight for the eyes and taste buds – while the relaxed vibe makes it the perfect sightseeing pit stop.No locals’ favourites list would be complete without mentioning Uchida Eatery. Tiny, busy, and serving lunch only until they sell out (and yes, they do sell out), you’ll have to be quick to enjoy the oh-so-tasty Japanese delights created daily by Uchida’s talented chef. Build your own teishoku from the range of simple but beautifully presented dishes, and experience an authentic taste of Japan.Complete your Victoria dining experience with a treat for your sweet tooth at Cold Comfort Ice Cream. Their “curiously-flavoured” slogan isn’t just a marketing ploy – with rotating offerings such as Canadian Breakfast (buttermilk, candied bacon, blueberry pancakes and maple), Christmas Tree (Douglas fir ice-cream, mandarin orange sorbet) and the amazing Best Break-up Ever (every fatty and sugary thing imaginable), this isn’t your average dessert stop.Whether you’re after a mid-afternoon aperitif or an evening tipple, the Livet has the benefit of a downtown location but the feeling of a hidden gem, featuring imaginative cocktails, share plates and a buzzy atmosphere (especially when the after-work crowd hits). Grab a seat on the balcony one story up for some open-air delight, then while away the hours sipping, snacking, and people watching.On the subject of cocktails, speakeasy-inspired joint Little Jumbo Cocktails combines the best of classic and modern mixology, serving craft creations that change every six weeks and are designed to pair perfectly with the small plates menu.

Rivalling New York City and LA, Toronto’s become a new premier destination for millennials curious to discover its thriving arts, culture, fashion and dining scenes.After taking in some of the top-tier downtown attractions, such as the CN Tower, head over to nearby Kensington Market. Spanning only a few blocks, the streets lined with outdoor fruit markets, musicians and local craft boutiques are emblematic of Toronto’s erse spirit.From Mexican to Japanese food, the market is a culinary beast. It’s home to Toronto’s best-rated taco shop, Seven Lives, where you can snatch a spot in line and grab a combo of three fish, octopus or shrimp tacos for less than £10.

While most of this guide features hotspots in the west end, the sweeping views of the skyline and flourishing culinary scene puts this east end spot on the map.Toronto’s appetite for brunch is huge – and its menus reflect the city’s status as one of the most erse in the world, fusing cultures, ingredients and techniques from across the globe.

Mixing traditional and Mexican-inspired dishes, the bright, airy space combines local hospitality with a touch of elegance.For lunch, the Real Jerk, which was the filming location for Drake and Rihanna’s music video for Work, is a family-run, unassuming spot for some of the city’s best West Indian cuisine.

Serving up plates of handmade pasta paired with perfect wine matches, it’s known as the date-night spot by neighbourhood denizens.If you’re heading back to the area for some fun after dark, the hottest spot at the moment is the Rooftop Bar at the Broadview Hotel. Housed in a historic building dating back to 1891, this newly renovated space, featuring industrial chic decorative touches, offers unmatched views of the city skyline. Another hotspot is the Vatican Gift Shop, where patrons step through a secret door, in what from the outside appears to be an unassuming storefront, into a neon-lit basement speakeasy to enjoy live music and a cocktail (or two).Get artsy on Queen Street West.

Finally, bring your A-game to Apartment 200 — perhaps the city’s trendiest bar, where Toronto’s top DJs go for a spin.Toronto has one of the world’s biggest Chinatowns, so it’s no surprise that it’s a fixture of the city.

Together they are known as the big three.State Street handles investments worth at least $38.3bn in publicly listed fossil fuel companies, according to an analysis for the  by InfluenceMap. Its stakes afford it a say on company directors, as well shareholder decisions on improving emissions disclosures and ensuring companies are aligned with the Paris agreement.The State Street boss pointed to its “aggressive” historical voting record on issues such as gender ersity on boards, and suggested climate change could become a priority, but refused to give a defined timescale.Large asset managers such as BlackRock and Vanguard have faced criticism for routinely voting against efforts to improve climate-related financial disclosures, appointing board directors to deal with climate-related business risk and publishing substantive emissions data. State Street’s record is mixed, although O’Hanley’s comments could signal an escalation in the firm’s approach.“If we conclude that a company’s board is not taking into account these risks then we will either vote all the board out or we’ll use our vote against the board or we’ll use it against iniduals on the board that we think should be acting and aren’t,” he said.“So it could be against the company chairman, against the head of the risk committee, but that is our strongest tool, our vote. And it’s a powerful tool because although it only takes a majority for someone to be voted in, typically if a significant minority has voted against a particular inidual on the board that’s generally taken as a lack of confidence and that will cause the person to leave, so these votes are important. It’s a high responsibility and we understand that.“Large asset managers, who do not own companies but exercise shareholder powers on behalf of clients, are uniquely positioned to hold the boards of oil and gas companies to account on the climate crisis and ensure a green energy transition.O’Hanley told the  that State Street preferred to discuss politically sensitive corporate governance issues such as the climate crisis, background checks on gun purchases in the US and board ersity in private with companies at first, opting to use its voting power as a last resort to demand action.He added: “Our work doesn’t revolve just around the vote. I mean at this moment, now, the entire team is out engaging with our various portfolio companies. They do this all day every day and they’re, on a company-by-company basis, developing a perspective on whether or not the board has this.“But I think it’s very dangerous to just say that every oil and gas company ought to have its board voted out. I mean … Put it this way, some of the best technology that’s going to get us through this is actually coming from oil and gas companies, right, if you look at what some of them are doing on renewables.Negative emissions technology such as carbon capture has been put forward by the oil and gas industry as a solution to the climate crisis, but there is widespread scepticism about its long-term viability.Pushed on when State Street would start using its vote more aggressively, O’Hanley said: “We engage as investment analysts do with each of the companies, determine where they are in dealing with this risk and overseeing this risk. And if our conclusion is they’re not then we will take a vote, but we don’t have a quota of votes.“It could be very much in the next season, it could be in 15 years we’re voting out people.”The asset management veteran also agreed that the industry must do more to improve disclosures around green and sustainable investing. Asked why State Street offered some fossil-fuel-free investment funds that had clear exposure to the fossil fuel industry, O’Hanley said his company was working hard to improve information about so-called environmental, sustainable and governance (ESG) investing, the acronym used for green investing.“One person’s ESG isn’t another person’s ESG. Part of this comes down to definitions and again, we would completely agree with you that there needs to be some kind of measurement here. We’re working quite hard on that. We’re working with some of the largest index providers in the world and you will see us announcing a few tools in a very short time frame that will help address that very problem that you’re stating,” O’Hanley said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8da03945736194ce74fe635c925b11e1aaa2625/0_0_9653_5792/master/9653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=539379ffe774750050bc08b8529a78a5","title":"top three asset managers fossil fuel investments","story":"Data reveals crucial role of BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard in climate crisisThe world’s three largest money managers have built a combined $300bn fossil fuel investment portfolio using money from people’s private savings and pension contributions, the  can reveal.BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, which together oversee assets worth more than China’s entire GDP, have continued to grow billion-dollar stakes in some of the most carbon-intensive companies since the Paris agreement, financial data shows.The two largest asset managers, BlackRock and Vanguard, have also routinely opposed motions at fossil fuel companies that would have forced directors to take more action on climate change, the analysis reveals.The investment rise is driven by the success in the last decade of tracker funds that use algorithms to follow major stock exchange indices such as the FTSE 100 and S\u0026ampP 500.  has worked with the thinktank InfluenceMap and the business data specialists ProxyInsight to analyse the role played by asset managers in the financing and management of some of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies. Figures compiled by InfluenceMap show how Blackrock, Vanguard and State Street – known as the big three – have become crucial climate actors in the financial world. They are the largest money managers in the $74tn industry.This means they are now the largest investors in public oil, gas and coal companies, managing funds for large pension funds, university endowments and insurance companies.While asset managers do not own the companies in which they invest, they often exercise shareholders rights on behalf of clients to vote on board members and company policy issues. Disclosures for publicly available company reports show that from 2015 to 2019 Vanguard and BlackRock used their votes to frequently oppose efforts to improve climate-related financial disclosures.The investigation by the  has found:BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street did not challenge the findings.They told the  they prioritised private engagements with company boards, where the climate crisis was regularly discussed. They said they had increased the size of their teams responsible for investment stewardship, opting to use their votes as a final resort.Vanguard said it neither managed the companies in which it invested nor sought to influence their business strategy. “As a steward of lifetime savings for more than 20 million people around the world, and a practically permanent investor in more than 10,000 companies, Vanguard is concerned about the long-term impact of climate risk,” a spokesman said.“While voting at shareholder meetings is important … it is only one part of the larger corporate governance process. We regularly engage with companies on our shareholders’ behalf and believe that engagement and broader advocacy, in addition to voting, can effect meaningful changes that generate long-term value for all shareholders.”Asset managers are increasingly finding themselves at the heart of social and environmental issues, and corporate governance experts have raised concerns about conflicts of interest in their business models.Campaigners are demanding asset managers vote out company directors who are not deemed to be taking sufficient action.In June, the London-based Legal \u0026amp General, formerly a top 20 investor in ExxonMobil, announced it was selling a $300m stake in the company and would use remaining shares to vote against the chief executive, Darren Woods.But environmental shareholder proposals face increasing challenges from the management of fossil fuel companies, which are being sustained by the American regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC declined to comment.In April, ExxonMobil shareholders were denied a vote on whether the company should set targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by the SEC, which called the proposal an attempt to “micromanage” the company.Data for the 2019 season of annual general meetings for shareholders, provided by Institutional Shareholder Services, shows that only a quarter of proposals made it to a vote at companies in the US, with 79 of the 105 motions either withdrawn or omitted. has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.The investigation has involved more than 20  journalists working across the world for the past six months.The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965.

Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.Despite setbacks, other proposals and engagements by asset managers have been more successful. In an industry first last year, intense pressure from shareholders forced Royal Dutch Shell to set carbon emission targets linked to executive pay. The decision was backed by Climate Action 100+, a group of $35tn investors who are pushing fossil fuel companies to react to the crisis.Many pension funds and asset managers support schemes to improve information about how climate-critical companies are responding to environmental concerns, including the Transition Pathway Initiative, which grades the boards of fossil fuel, energy and transport companies on their response.BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are supporters of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, a voluntary scheme chaired by the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg to improve information."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83074bd55f8df2a3578531caa035726d12742f7b/0_0_2640_1760/master/2640.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abe600540ba66f2681b4ca2e6c9bced3 720w","title":"big fashion brands collectable sticker art","story":"If you thought stickers were the preserve of toddlers’ books and playgrounds, think again. Branded stickers are now among the fashion industry’s most sought-after items, something to slap on laptops and lunchboxes as a way of conveying an affinity with a label at a fraction of the cost of buying its goods.Last week, skateboard brand Palace released its winter sticker pack and it sold out within an hour. With other rare versions, such as a single Supreme x Playboy sticker, reselling online for as much as £200, the big-name fashion brands are also jumping on the bandwagon.Calvin Klein Jeans recently made stickers using a classic 1980s image by Richard Avedon of Brooke Shields, while the fashion brand Coach has produced leather stickers, and Berlin’s hip o32c magazine featured sticker sheets from Louis Vuitton’s creative director, Virgil Abloh. A partnership between the luggage manufacturer Rimowa and Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson yielded a limited edition of suitcase stickers that sold out immediately.“It shows you’re part of a subculture,” said Dominik Pollin, of the Dover Street Market bookstore, Idea.Michael Kopelman, managing director at Stüssy, said: “It’s fun. You can put them on your car or lunchbox. It’s like tagging. Most won’t notice it, but the people who are interested do spot it.” Although councils in England and Wales restrict flyers and stickers in public places, they are increasingly appearing on lamp-posts and billboards across the country.Alex Powis, co-founder of Stickerarchive, an online collection of popular graphics, said: “Slapping a sticker up … is instant, whereas graffiti takes time and guts. It’s like coded messaging.”Traditionally not for sale by fashion labels, stickers have become an affordable way to tap into a brand. “There’s been a surge of interest in streetwear, lately and stickers are a core part of those cultures,” said Powis.Sarah Andelman, founder of the French concept store Colette, is a collector herself. “I have about three boxes full of all kinds of stickers that I started keeping from the age of 15,” she said.Instagram accounts such as Supstickers, dedicated to indexing and reselling stickers, have more than 50,000 followers. Edson Sabajo, CEO of Dutch streetwear brand Patta, said that sticker fans were taking part in the decades-old pastime of collecting.“Ours reference the latest graphics and give you a memory about a certain timeframe. That’s why they’re always changing,” he said. “People collect them all.”Others agree that the trend is a move away from the internet towards a more DIY approach. “In the last few months, I’ve been making more stickers,” said the electronic musician James Lavelle. “There’s something about having physical things that’s the opposite to a huge digital marketing campaign. There’s an authenticity about them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f8df2b83bd2bd813e24a24c3562d3b1298fd82c/0_505_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b05280ffcc371e8e2d8763b250abd5aa","title":"pork belly galette yotam ottolenghi recipes with apple","story":"Seasonal dishes to make good use of the apple harvest, including roast pork belly and a spiced galetteA few weeks ago, I went to my local greengrocer to buy apples to dip in honey for Jewish New Year, and ended up with a selection box from the National Fruit Collection in Brogdale, Kent.It turned out to be a deliciously sweet dip, and also a lucky dip, because I had no idea which of the 2,000-plus types of Brogdale apples I was eating – the kaleidoscope of flavours was staggering. Sadly, our shops sell only a tiny fraction of these varieties, but that’s no reason not to try to seek them out.Today’s recipes specify so-called ‘standard’ apples, but they’d all work with any type that is equally crisp, sweet and cheerful.The flavours in this dish are inspired by Filipino pork adobo, in which the meat is cooked in a sweet and vinegary, soy-based sauce. Here, I use apple juice, apple vinegar and whole apples to cut through that richness. Don’t be put off by the long cooking time – once everything’s in the oven, it’s mostly just a waiting game. Serve with plain rice.1 whole pork belly joint (800-900g), bonelessFlaked sea salt1½ tbsp olive oil1 large onion, peeled and cut into 6 wedges 12 garlic cloves, peeled40g fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped4 whole star anise3 bay leaves90ml soy sauce250ml chicken stock250ml unsweetened apple juice (I use a cloudy variety)70ml apple cider vinegar2 tbsp caster sugar1 tsp black peppercorns, crushed3 medium Pink Lady apples (400g), cored and cut into quarters2 spring onions, thinly slicedHeat the oven to 185C (165C fan)365Fgas 4½. Use a small, sharp knife to score the skin of the pork in a cross-hatch pattern spaced roughly 1½cm apart, then rub a teaspoon of flaked salt into the skin, push it down into the slashes.Put the oil in a large ovenproof saute pan on a medium-high heat, then fry the onion, stirring, for three minutes, just to soften. Add the garlic, ginger, star anise and bay leaves, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are lightly coloured – another three minutes. Add the soy, stock, apple juice, vinegar, sugar and black peppercorns, and bring to a simmer.Take off the heat and lay in the pork, skin side up, taking care not to get the skin wet (it should not at any stage be submerged in liquid). Transfer to the oven, roast for 90 minutes, then remove and arrange the apples around the pork, stirring gently to coat them in the sauce and again taking care not to get any liquid on the skin. Return to the oven for 30 minutes, or until the apples have softened but still retain their shape, and the pork is deeply golden.Gently lift the pork on to a board, leave to rest for 10-15 minutes, then cut into 1½cm-thick slices. To serve, transfer the contents of the saute pan to a serving dish with a lip, lay the pork slices on top and sprinkle with the spring onions.Besides its use in today’s apple galette (see next recipe), this butter is delicious spread on hot toast or stirred into porridge or yoghurt.

Place a fine-mesh sieve over a large saute pan, tip in the fruit and pass it through the sieve, pushing down with the back of a large spoon to extract as much puree as possible. You should end up with about 1.6kg discard the solids left in the sieve. Add the remaining ingredients to the pan, stir to combine, then place on a medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for two hours, stirring regularly to prevent the mix scorching on the bottom, or until thickened and reduced by about half. Remove and discard the vanilla pod, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves and strips of lemon zest, and leave to cool completely before using (or pour into sterilised jars and seal).This galette came about mostly as an excuse to make the apple butter in the first recipe, though, to be honest, you don’t really need one to do that. To save time, by all means use bought-in apple sauce instead, though perhaps stir some cinnamon through it first. If you want to get ahead, make the dough up to three days in advance and keep it well wrapped in the fridge (or make it even further ahead and freeze for up to a month). Serve with a caramel sauce, as in the photograph, for extra decadence.For the dough250g plain flour1½ tsp caster sugar¾ tsp salt200g fridge-cold unsalted butter, cut into 1½ cm cubes75ml ice-cold water1 tsp apple cider vinegarFor the filling185g spiced apple butter (see today’s recipe) or bought-in apple sauce (see recipe introduction)600g granny smith apples (ie, about 4 medium apples), cored but skin-on1 tbsp lemon juice50g unsalted butter, melted1 tbsp caster sugar3 tbsp apricot jam1½ tbsp calvados (or brandy, or water)Creme fraiche, to serveFirst make the dough. Put the flour, sugar and salt in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Add the butter cubes, but without mixing them in, then freeze the bowl and its contents for 30 minutes.Tip the chilled mixture into a food processor and pulse a few times, until the cold butter breaks down to the size of peas. Add the water and vinegar, and pulse a few times more, just until the dough starts to come together. Transfer to a clean work surface and use your hands to bring it together into a cohesive dough, working quickly so it keeps nice and cold (that’s the secret to ensuring a light, flaky galette pastry). Shape into a rough round, wrap tightly to make it airtight, then refrigerate for at least two hours or overnight.Heat the oven to 210C (200C fan)425Fgas 7. Put the dough on a well-floured surface and roll it out into a 35cm-diameter circle. Carefully lift this on to a lined baking tray and fold about 1½cm of the pastry’s edge over on itself all the way round. Repeat, so it now has a double folded rim. Crimp decoratively all around the edge, if you wish, then spread the spiced apple butter (or apple sauce) evenly over the base, avoiding the rim. Refrigerate the dough while you make the filling.Using a mandoline or sharp knife, finely slice the apples into 2mm-thick rounds. Put in a bowl with the lemon juice and toss to coat. Arrange the slices on top of the galette base in concentric circles, overlapping them slightly, until the base is completely covered. Brush the apples with the melted butter, then sprinkle with the sugar. Bake for 30 minutes, then turn the tray around and turn down the heat to 190C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Bake for another 20-25 minutes, or until golden and the apples are catching a little at the edges. Transfer to a rack and leave to cool slightly.Put the jam and calvados in a small saucepan and heat gently to warm through, whisking to combine. Brush this mixture evenly over the apples, then slide the galette on to a serving plate or board. Serve warm or at room temperature, with the creme fraiche alongside and some caramel sauce, if you like."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b3b953cb52a6911ac3e39977d313e8ee209270c/196_807_3214_1929/master/3214.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84dde89370ddc3ac559e5f2faea10ca9","title":"old school england lose control southgate czech republic","story":"Tactically undercooked and muddled at the back, England’s failure felt like a visitation from the ghost behind the doorSo much for the sunlit uplands. Friday night in Prague: this was supposed to be a romp past the post for Gareth Southgate’s England 2.0, a breasting of the tape en route to the clear blue skies of next summer’s European championship. In the build-up the key questions had been about how exactly England would go about brushing past the Czech Republic how they might finesse the moment.Instead England were terrible – and terrible in a gruellingly old school kind of way. This was not just a 2-1 defeat. Tactically undercooked, limp and muddled at the back, at times it felt like a visitation from the ghost behind the door. There they were stalking the pitch: the horrors of Nice, São Paulo and Kyiv, white shapes flickering at the edge of things, eyes hollow, teeth chattering.No doubt this had been coming. There had been tremors. But then all international teams operate in a vacuum, borne aloft on warm winds of hope and hype. To his credit Gareth Southgate has never really talked his own team up. “We know there is a lot of work still to be done,” England’s manager said in defeat, as he has also in victory. This will be the challenge now: to find and act on the lessons from a muddled Group A defeat to a Czech team that thoroughly deserved its 2-1 victory.Did England take the Czech Republic lightly? It will be tempting to conclude that this was the case given the shift not just in personnel, but in shape and outlook, the feeling of a team that began this game as though it was already 4-0 up and cruising to the finish.There was even something agreeably corrective and astringent about the identity of the player who scored the winning goal against England’s team of Premier League princes. With six minutes to go and the score 1-1 Zdenek Ondrasek, on as a sub, found himself alone in front of goal.Ondrasek is 30 years old. He plays for FC Dallas. This was his first call-up, but he is clearly a popular figure in the Czech team. At the pre-match training session his teammates had cheered as he mis-controlled a high ball, then lined to slap him on his bald head, the claps echoing round the empty stands.But Ondrasek did for England here. The finish was neat. The celebration was brilliantly bellicose. More to the point, it was always coming. England will still make it to next summer’s Euros. But on a chilly October night they showed how they might fall short when they get there.It came down to control. England teams do not have control. This has been their history. The most encouraging note in this Southgate team has been to buck the trend. But not so here. Pockets of space had been opening up throughout the game. There were warnings. Five minutes before the break something horrible had happened to England’s midfield and defence. Patrik Schick took the ball in his own half, veered right and simply ran away from the white shirts, hoovering up the vast, slightly shocking green spaces down an unguarded right flank as Jordan Henderson and Kieran Trippier puffed and paddled in his wake.There was an air of raggedness to the white shirts in those moments, the sense of a malfunctioning machine, circuit boards flickering, parts starting to jangle. It came from England’s selection here but more from the way that selection played out.Mason Mount came into England’s midfield to offer a hint of craft. In the event he played so high up the pitch, creating an overloaded four-man front line, that Henderson and Declan Rice were left undermanned against a trio of neat, skilful opponents.This was more than just a change of texture. It was a full-on, unrehearsed change of shape in a live qualifying game, a relax of tension in the centre that left England scrabbling for a hold. Henderson moved constantly to cover spaces, but somehow always opening another behind him. It was not really his fault. Henderson thrives in a coherent system. This was not that.Mount looked lost at times. He touched the ball eight times in the opening half hour. Time and again Alex Kral popped up in space behind him, a galloping shaggy-haired figure who ran the game for periods in the first half.And all this after England had started well at the Sinobo Stadium, a low-rise oval with a wood-panelled flying roof above its grey concrete tiers. The opening goal came from the first real flex of England’s forward muscles. Harry Kane dropped deep and eased a lovely pass in to Raheem Sterling’s path. He ran straight for goal, checked inside and allowed Lukas Masopust to take his standing leg. Kane buried the penalty kick.At which point, England just deflated. The equaliser saw the defence opened up twice in quick succession, as brittle as it had been in the second half against Kosovo. Here Jakub Brabec poked the ball in after a scramble that saw England’s defence respond with all the well-drilled resilience of a platoon of drunken sailors.The challenge will be to learn from this performance. Southgate did the right thing here, looking for something more from his midfield, risking defeat in search of a more convincing kind of victory. The lesson, which is never a bad one, is that England are not yet what they want to be. Suddenly Bulgaria in Sofia on Monday looks like a test where once it had seemed likely to be a lap of honour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960213df39c75ba31ff461f73b640efdbea15081/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43eb8967c17cd00eeb1d95dadd18600e","title":"china world cup dream","story":"China’s upsurge in fortunes follows the decision to redefine what being a Chinese footballer actually meansChina is a very large country, inhabited by many Chinese. Looking back it seems fair to say Charles de Gaulle was probably right in this assessment, not to say prophetic. In the intervening years China has become even larger. It is inhabited by even more Chinese.To the outsider this vastness can seem a little dizzying. This is the last great wilderness once humans have killed off the rest of them: other humans. China has more than one hundred cities with more than a million inhabitants, cities with their own traditions, infrastructure, hierarchies, artisan coffee stall scenes and endless, unknowable inner lives. China has 250 million pensioners. Imagine four United Kingdoms occupied entirely by old people. Imagine four Brexits. That’s how many people there are in China.And yet it seems this still isn’t quite enough. Not when it comes to World Cup qualifying and the fevered dreams of Xi Jinping-era Chinese football. As of this month it is necessary to add a plus-one to the 1.4 billion population in the shape of former Everton and England Under-21 defender Tyias Browning, who is now a Chinese citizen, and even has a Chinese name: Jiang Guangtai.Browning signed for Guangzhou Evergrande in February after spells at Sunderland, Preston and Wigan. Six months later he is officially Chinese. Although not yet Chinese enough – according to reports in the Chinese-English media – for his legal team to convince Fifa he has the right to take part in this week’s round of AFC Group A World Cup qualifiers.When full clearance arrives Browning will have a fair chance of lining up in China’s central defence behind another familiar face. Nico Yennaris did play for China against Guam this week. In July, Yennaris, formerly of Arsenal and the England age groups, became the first naturalised player for the world’s most populous nation. He also has a Chinese name: Li Ke.There is a serendipity to all this. Fancy seeing you here old boy! Eight years ago Jiang Guangtai and Li Ke played on opposite sides as Arsenal reserves beat Everton reserves 4-1 at London Colney, a match also notable for the fact Shkodran Mustafi was in the Everton defence, albeit with a scoreline made slightly less notable by the fact Shkodran Mustafi was in the Everton defence.Five years ago Browning was on the bench next to Harry Kane as a Gareth Southgate England Under-21 team played Wales in a Euro qualifier. Fast forward another three and he could yet end up marking Kane at the Qatar World Cup. It is a possibility that has moved closer with the upsurge in China’s fortunes since the decision to redefine what being a Chinese footballer actually means.It should be said Yennaris and Browning have a Chinese family link: Browning through his grandfather and Yennaris, who was born in Hackney, London, through his mother. But they also appear to be the exceptions in this vanguard.Elkeson, a 30-year-old Brazilian from Maranhão, also played for China as they thrashed the island of Guam 7-0. Rumour has it Ricardo Goulart, another journeyman Brazilian, could soon be naturalised. Even Alex Teixeira, perpetually Premier League-linked, could be considered for naturalisation from 2021, just in time for Qatar.The obvious question is: does any of this matter? Football careers are an adventure, journeys without maps. Yennaris and Browning have family ties. Elkeson wrapped himself in the Chinese flag and wept in front of his parents in the stands after his debut against the Males last month. Good luck to them all – enjoy the ride.But it does raise some interesting questions. Questions such as, what is international sport for? This is not a test of genes. It’s not supposed to be about soft power or reflecting glory on political egomaniacs. The only logical purpose is a test of systems, a way of seeing how well, how efficiently, each country has arranged its resources, of learning from one another for the wider public good, working out what works, what doesn’t work, refining the system.When other forces start to blur these boundaries it can skew the picture. Under this logic Owen Hargreaves was not really an English footballer because he didn’t learn any of his football there. Whereas Tammy Abraham, for example, is English, his sporting skill-set forged in English football, a reflection of good choices made somewhere along the way.China seemed to get this, to see its huge investment in football as a chance also to improve the lives of its citizens, albeit in slightly mind-boggling, group-think fashion. Xi wants China to win the World Cup. He also wants to transform its population, with billions poured into football facilities in every school, academy programmes for all, and additional taxes on overseas players filling the professional leagues.Communism! But take a step back, these are all brilliant ideas, not least when compared with the UK’s lack of public facilities, the abandonment of the population to ill-health and obesity. Bring it on. Bring on the centrally funded means of football production.Except it hasn’t quite worked out. China failed to qualify for Russia 2018 and something seemed to shift. The employment of Marcello Lippi as national team manager on $28m a year was a bit of an eyeroll-emoji moment. And yet in a way the pragmatism and fudged principles are much more authentically football, closer to the real world, the hunger for victory at any cost that so often leads to defeat and frustration at any cost.Stockpile your Brazilians. Thrash Guam and wildly overcelebrate before your inevitable elimination some time next year. This is all a part of football’s brilliance, its refusal to bend, the sense of something untamed and doggedly defiant that still lies beneath the corporate layers. Welcome on board, China. Just remember it doesn’t get any easier from here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75068ab10a4b43c08bbd21337421a31e05f0767e/0_121_3344_2006/master/3344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e6b1f2129fe419b0ba2b0a5f0aab617","title":"georgia v republic of ireland euro 2020 qualifier live","story":"35 mins: Ireland threaten! Robinson crosses from the right, but McClean can’t quite reach it as it bounces across goal!33 mins: The Republic win the ball but make a hash of clearing, Whelan testing Randolph with a slightly troublesome back-pass, and Randolph then mishitting his clearance along the ground and straight into trouble. They get away with it.30 mins: Qazaishvili twinkles on the left but fails to find space to cross, then gets it back, tries again and fails again. Georgia eventually give up on the whole crossing thing and pass the ball all the way back to their defence.27 mins: Doherty storms down the left, cuts inside, gets to the byline, but he has no confidence in his left foot and in contorting himself to centre with his right he lets the ball run out of play.25 mins: Ireland have fought their way into this game, keeping play inside the central third for a while. When Georgia do push forward, Ireland once again intercept, clear and win a free kick, Hourihane being fouled by Kiteishvili.22 mins: “Is it just me, or does this match seem to be going in slow motion?” asks Joe Pearson. “Oh, and the pitch looks dreadful.” I think it might just be you, though Georgia certainly favour an approach that could be called either patient or boring, depending on your outlook. The pitch is a bit bobbly, though.20 mins: Nine players back (plus the keeper, so 10 really) for the Irish as Georgia threaten, but the home side can’t find a way through.18 mins: Ireland have the ball, and keep it for a little while. The home fans whistle in fury.15 mins: Never mind Lord of the Dance, the Republic are very much playing second fiddle here. Still, they nearly scored from their only attacking free-kick, so there’s some promise there.13 mins: Another attack from the home side, but this time when the ball is chipped into the box Okriashvili theatrically throws himself to the turf, and is rightly ignored by the referee.12 mins: Chance for Georgia! The ball is laid back to Ananidze, just outside the Republic’s penalty area, who has time to measure his shot but fluffs his calculations and scuffs it wide. 10 mins: Georgia attack down the right again, but this time the cross is low and Glenn Whelan is well placed to intercept and clear. Again, Ireland then win a free kick in their own half and can relax a bit.7 mins: Georgia work a fine attack, keeping possession well, moving the ball, bringing numbers forward, but when they eventually cross from the right it’s headed clear, and Collins wins a free kick just outside the area.4 mins: Ireland hit the post! They win a free kick on the left flank, which Hourihane sends into the area. Egan does well to win the header and glance it across goal, but with the goalkeeper a spectator it hits the meat of the post and rebounds to a defender who clears!1 mins: The first shot of the day comes off the right boot of Qazaishvili, who from 15 yards or so lashes the ball well wide of goal.1 min: And they’re off! The home side get the game going.Anthems over, we’re about to get some football.There is some absolutely horrible anthem-singing from the Georgian players. I’m not sure who the microphone was pointing at at the start, but the noise coming out of his mouth is unforgivable.And out they come! Judging by the number of green-shirted supporters shielding their eyes, the away end has got the worst of the setting sun.The players are in the tunnel, with kick-off just a few minutes away.Looks like a lovely day in Tbilisi. The picture wires are full of pictures of people in T-shirts. Well, Irish fans in T-shirts and locals in jumpers. Still, blue skies at least.Mick McCarthy has a chat, firstly about James Collins:He’s come up into the Championship this year, he’s playing well and scoring goals and I thought he made the difference when he came on against Bulgaria. Players who sit on the bench and travel around when they get a chance they have to take it, and he did that.On his back four, and Doherty at left-back:He’s done fine. I’ve asked him when we’ve trained, just go and play at left-back. He’s one of the best wing-backs over the last two or three years, he’s played left-back for one and a half seasons with Wolves before. I think if you’d asked him, he’d rather be there than not involved.I want to perform like we did against them in Dublin. That’s to get the first and stop them playing, and when we have it to be comfortable in possession and try and pin them back. I’d like to come off thinking we’d been equal in possession.Ken Early’s match preview for the  is excellent. It’s here, and worth a click.The teams in full, then:Georgia: Loria, Kakabadze, Kashia, Tabidze, Grigalava, Kankava, Kiteishvili, Okriashvili, Ananidze, Qazaishvili, Kvilitaia. Subs: Elguja Lobjanidze, Shengelia, Makaridze, Saba Lobjanidze, Navalovski, Kharaishvili, Aburjania, Daushvili, Khotcholava, Kupatadze, Kvirkvelia. Republic of Ireland: Randolph, Coleman, Duffy, Egan, Doherty, Whelan, Hourihane, Robinson, Hendrick, McClean, Collins. Subs: Long, Browne, Connolly, Cullen, Byrne, Williams, O’Hara, O’Dowda, Maguire, Hogan, Travers, Judge. Referee: Marco Guida (Italy).Here’s the Georgia team, in two alphabets. They make one change to the team that drew with Denmark, Jaba Kankava replacing Giorgi Aburjania in midfield:Team news! James Collins makes his competitive debut for the Republic of Ireland, replacing the injured David McGoldrick, in one of three changes from last month’s friendly win over Bulgaria. Matt Doherty replaces the suspended Enda Stevens at left-back and John Egan moves into central defence.Top of the group by two points, unbeaten in five games, the Republic of Ireland’s qualifying campaign is going swimmingly. But they could still flounder: their two remaining games after this one are against Switzerland (in Geneva on Tuesday) and at home to Denmark, the two other teams competing for final berths. Crucially however those two play in Copenhagen today, making this one final and fantastic opportunity for the Irish to put daylight between themselves and their pursuers. Today’s results will not be definitive, but they could come close: should Ireland win today and Denmark lose, Mick McCarthy will know that a draw in his side’s final home game, or a win in either of their final two fixtures, would be enough.The build-up has been illuminated by some entertaining dancing-related repartee between the managers, with Weiss saying that Ireland “play with phenomenal energy, just like Michael Flatley dances. There are good dancers in Georgia too, but he’s very special.” When McCarthy was told about this assessment he paused to think for a while before settling on being very pleased. “When someone describes you as someone who is as brilliant as Michael Flatley, such a wonderful performer and dancer, and a good guy, actually, I’ll take that as a huge compliment of my team,” he beamed.So once they lace up their boots, will Ireland turn out to be more Michael Flatley or Ed Balls* today? We’re about to find out! Well, in an hour or so anyway. Until then, welcome! * More recent dancing-related comparisons unavailable due to ignorance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f893dcf8e0fb6da621c8dec0ed23c742c0fa3cb8/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b47ab5592b6a76e99075ce3e81caadc","title":"blind date ashleigh mike","story":"What were you hoping for?Finding astrological perfection, or at the very least an evening of lol moments.What did you talk about?His ex-girlfriend, our jobs, what we do in our spare time, and what we are looking for in a partner.Any awkward moments?Most of the evening.Best thing about Mike?He seemed sweet.Would you introduce him to your friends?

Grouped around the dining table in his apartment in Berlin’s central Mitte district are three velvet armchairs the interior architect salvaged from what he calls the “Honecker lounge” at East Germany’s State Council Building, moulded over time by the well-nourished bottoms of Soviet apparatchiks. The table itself was formerly a conference table at Berlin’s Evangelical Academy, and if you look under the table top you realise the short legs are propped up on some old-fashioned metal money boxes, like a piece of concept art. “I’ve always wondered why this table is so low,” Pöppler says as he strolls through his apartment on sunny autumn morning. “One theory is that the Protestant church didn’t want people in important meetings to be able to hide behind the furniture. Isn’t that a beautiful idea?”Pöppler, whose practice usually designs and builds living spaces for other people, lives in an apartment that not only speaks of his love for the ideas behind everyday objects, but also doubles as a museum of the German capital’s tumultuous history.Originally from outside Bremen, in the north of Germany, Pöppler arrived in Berlin in autumn 1989, when the city was still ided. At the time, living space was hard to find in the western half, and the young architecture student spent weeks roaming the streets, ringing doorbells to see if tenants would let him explore and admire their buildings. “As a student, it felt as if there was a point when I knew every house in Berlin.”Two months after his arrival, the Berlin Wall fell, opening up swathes of new territory to the architectural magpie’s searching mind. In 1995, Pöppler found this 150 sq m apartment, in a tenement building from the 1890s, not far from the Checkpoint Charlie border-crossing. Partly derelict, the building had been earmarked to be torn down and replaced by a Plattenbau (concrete prefab) like the one on the opposite side of the road. There was no central heating, only a coal-burning oven that required constant attention – “a bit like looking after a dog”. But Pöppler and his partner took the plunge.The interior of the average Berlin altbau (period) apartment is pared back: for years the prevailing fashion was to leave walls white and let the battered herringbone parquet or the period plastering on the ceiling serve as the sole adornment. “For ages, even sofas were considered too bourgeois,” Pöppler says .Entering his second-floor apartment is an entirely different experience: the entrance hall’s walls wash over you in a warm Wedgwood blue, the ceiling glimmers with a hint of masking-tape yellow. A dusty pink table Pöppler picked up from a tailor in West Berlin greets the visitor coquettishly. In the living room to the left, there are explosions of colour: a Chinese export carpet from the 1920s, and a collection of abstract paintings by Hans Brosch, an East German painter who used a study trip to the Musée d’Orsay in Paris to escape to the west in 1979.Raised in a family home in “shades of beige and black”, Pöppler has made use of colour his practice’s signature, though he insists there is no underlying theory behind his choices, just instinct. He’s not a fan of the trend for Farrow \u0026amp Ball-style British paints, because they tend to be “quite foggy”, preferring instead French manufacturers, which he says pack more of a punch.One characteristic feature of 19th-century tenement buildings in the city is the so-called Berliner Zimmer, an awkward, often dark room that connects the street-facing part of the apartment with the inner courtyard behind, once decried by Friedrich Engels as a “haven of darkness, stale air and Berlin philistinism”. But in Pöppler’s apartment, the Prussian cobwebs are blown away by an almost baroque gusto for playful design ideas. In his Berliner Zimmer, the flat’s kitchen, a vintage cabinet he has “dragged around since I was 14” hangs next to an artwork made out of salad forks with deer-antler handles, assembled by his long-term American associate Remo Lotano.In the adjacent bedroom, a central ceiling lamp is replaced by four coloured lights in each corner of the room. A stuffed jay peers down from its perch above the doorway.Stories from Berlin’s past reveal themselves only as you enter a room for a second or third time: there is the garden table on the courtyard terrace that Pöppler found on the street in Prenzlauer Berg, bent out of shape by the weather and riddled with worm holes. There is the sputnik ceiling light salvaged from the foyer of an East Berlin sports hall. Or there are the shelves he got from a bookshop that was subsidised by the East German regime and closed down after the fall of the Wall, which are built to hold only slim paperbacks of Marxist theory.In recent years, however, Pöppler and Lotano have spent less time roaming junk shops and closing-down sales, and more time designing and manufacturing their own pieces of furniture. In the apartment’s brightest spot, in front of the window that looks out on to the street, pride of place belongs to a elegant chaise longue with feet of curling steel, and a porcelain cupboard that looks as if it is made of, rather than made to store, fine china.“I wouldn’t want to say vintage is over,” Lotano says. “But there’s also a type of vintage that blinds you to the idea behind the furniture.” The ghosts of the past are still there, they just need to be kept on their toes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b818cb19f1b8eefaab97ffdc6096cf1b1f3b102d/145_336_2861_1717/master/2861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ffedbaa1c76396e854f8601099c540e","title":"lupita nyongo wanted to be botanist","story":"The actor on wanting to visit Scotland and being kept awake by scary moviesBorn in Mexico, Lupita Nyong’o, 36, was raised in Kenya.

Here the team behind it explain how they brought the new brand campaign to lifeTwo weeks ago, the  launched its latest brand campaign focused on the theme of hope. The hero advert depicts the struggle of a painted lady butterfly battling against the odds and succeeding. The campaign highlights the ’s purpose to not only hold power to account, but to explore new ways of doing things, bringing new ideas to the table and giving people the facts to challenge the status quo.We spoke to Anna Bateson (chief customer officer), Sonia Sudhakar (marketing director), Kate Davies (head of brand and awareness), Joel Midgley (senior marketing manager), and Kate Robarts (marketing manager)AB - It was incredibly important to us that what we were saying was both rooted in this moment but also in our editorialpurpose. There have been times over the past three years, Trump, Brexit, the climate strikes – when we could have run a campaign re-stating our role or talking specifically about that issue. For us, however, we wanted our readers to feel inspired by a more enduring belief which editor-in-chief Katharine Viner articulated in her 2017 essay “A mission for journalism in a time of crisis” . In this article she says “people long to feel hopeful again and that hope, above all, is a faith in our capacity to act together to make change”.This idea is central to our campaign. We want our readers to feel that although the issues that face us can seem overwhelming, the  is offering clarity and alternatives which can help to make sense of the world. “Hope is Power” feels relevant and urgent in these disorientating times. It’s a message we can all rally behind. Our campaign is connected to the ’s purpose - we’re here for our readers - we don’t have any stakeholders or a billionaire owner. We really wanted to provide our readers with a sense of hope and optimism against the current backdrop.KD - The campaign launched on 23 September and will run for five weeks in the UK, US and Australia. It is the first time we have made a statement like this at a global level. It’s a different way of doing a brand campaign for us because we are now a digital-first global organisation, the last time we did this, in 2012, we were at the start of the “open journalism” model, now our open platform allows us to reach millions of readers across the world every day.We also wanted the campaign to reach people in an interesting but meaningful way in their everyday lives, so we targeted cities in the UK where we have a high percentage of  readers with flyposters. Additionally, we developed bright and powerful statements which were posted online and in locations across the UK, US and Australia.We created a film to bring Hope is Power to life which is playing nationally in cinemas and on video on demand. The campaign relied on carefully targeted use of the ’s platforms, contra agreements and an effective media plan including the use of flyposting and targeted podcast ads.SS - Our campaign asks for “support” – we want more of our readers to feel inspired to support us financially – that means making a contribution or subscribing. Importantly we want to recognise the valued support of our current supporters and hopefully make them feel as proud to work with us.KD - We wanted to create something totally distinctive and powerful without breaking the bank. Lots of ideas were explored with the creative team, but we had some clear rules, nothing too masculine, nothing too angry and it had to feel “”. We have this incredible heritage in advertising and storytelling and it had to be as good as our previous adverts.From there we explored different icons and ideas of hope to contrast with this powerful song. The butterfly stood out immediately. The idea that this really quite familiar and domestic struggle could capture beautifully the assumption of powerlessness, but then the surprising almost violent breakthrough – an impossible act really but one that seems to connect so well with our readers.The fact that we used a painted lady was also important. It is a resilient species that, in the face of the climate emergency, was seen in unusually high numbers in the UK this year. It is also a global species travelling from Africa to the Arctic circle annually - what could be more hopeful than that?JM - In total the campaign took six months to develop. We started by making sure that we fully explored Viner’s essay, interviewing editorial colleagues in our territories to explore the ideas behind this essay and how it has translated into our journalism.When we started this process we wanted to find creative partners who were able to grasp the rich heritage of the  and our role in the changing context of the world.Uncommon responded with a bold and distinctive creative idea and series of powerful statements anchored to the ’s purpose.The campaign makes heavy use of flyposters and so we wanted the creative to capture a feeling of protest, an energy that we think is really important in the current climate and it seems to be resonating really well with readers.KD - This is a carefully planned campaign aimed at deepening affinity with our readers. It is strongly connected to supporter initiatives globally which build towards our ambition to reach 2 million supporters by 2022.We are unique in being a quality independent news site with no paywall and we believe that this reader-funded model is the right one. The idea that if you can afford to pay for quality news your contribution helps others to access it is really compelling. But we do need to keep talking to our readers about this to ensure we reach our ambitious goals and remain sustainable.KR - We have had a really positive reaction so far. We are an emotional brand - we see surges in support around times of heightened emotion - anxiety, excitement, inspiration - the campaign captures this. People are fed up with despair, gloomy predictions and feeling helpless.  is here to offer fresh ideas, alternatives and hope and it seems like our readers are ready to be part of that.KD - ‘Hope is Power’ is an idea that we think lives beyond this campaign. It’s linked to our purpose and we want to continue to develop ways of talking to our readers about it and supporting the amazing work that our journalists do. We are working very closely with our global teams and the rest of the organisation to develop a strategy that supports our reader-funded model for the next few years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f26f6dfc1486d314ca5f52b7233d4e1b4e5a27af/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c889d5c96a36923d239954608223a00","title":"kano live royal albert hall review","story":"Royal Albert Hall, LondonThe star of TV’s Top Boy storms the Albert Hall with a set that fuses beauty with the raw sound of the streetsIt starts with someone in the stalls waving a crutch in the air. It ends with tiers of velvet-lined swivel seating quaking as Kano rewinds 3 Wheel Ups, a tune from 2016 in which he boasts that DJs rewind his songs that often because he’s so good. Each reload whips the crowd into stiffer peaks and rattles the seating harder. At one point before the encore, two sousaphone players stage a battle, honking out the hooks of grime classics one after the other, the crowd picking the winner. It is impossible to leave this landmark gig without a wide grin and plenty to mull over.As a genre, grime has hit any number of conventional milestones in recent years. Stormzy has headlined Glastonbury, Skepta and Dave have won Mercury prizes and Wiley has been given an MBE, to name a few – but there is still something deeply symbolic in this east London takeover of the seat of the British musical establishment. It’s not an absolute first: BBC 1Xtra staged a grime prom in 2015, and the venue has latterly made space for Afrobeats and drum’n’bass. But tickets for the final date on Kano’s current UK tour sold out in minutes and even if the Albert Hall’s outreach programme meant they were reasonably priced, this gig is really the result of two-way rapprochement in which a former Cinderella genre, actively persecuted by police for a decade, comes of age. It would be unfair to rob Kano of his menace and immediacy by saying he is a mature artist, but there is a logic to Kane Robinson being the grime artist on this stage.At 34, Robinson is now a wiser elder statesman, still immersed in the culture, but able to see the bigger picture, musically and sociologically. He is a quiet sort of star, who tends to avoid the outward trappings of his success. Thanks to his starring role as Sully on the recently revived Top Boy, a hit that topped Netflix’s most recent UK Top 10, he also has considerable star power at his disposal, but he is alive to the complications his work throws up. In interviews, Robinson has noted how this season of Top Boy has sought to deglorify the on-screen violence more than previously. Sully’s character, previously a hard nut, has gained a dimension or two.Crucially, Kano’s own musical oeuvre has ranged far from the tinny, dystopian urgency of grime’s early productions, becoming more nimble and musical by the album. His latest – Hoodies All Summer, released two months ago – may be a stark state-of-the-nation address to young postcode warriors clashing bloodily over benighted bits of turf. But it is also a beautifully wrought work, elegantly produced and dappled with light and shade, humour and cinematic uses of sound.Tonight, Kano takes full advantage of the Albert Hall’s hallowed acoustics to bring Hoodies into 3D. Because this works deserves it, he deploys a four-piece band, a gospel choir, a horn section and, towards the end, a small army of steel pan players, the nomes Steel Orchestra.It’s like church: everyone bar the guest MCs is wearing white and the gospel singers stamp their mellifluous authority on a number of songs. It’s like carnival, too: the horns are mobile and wander about the stage, while a few steel pan players shimmy to the fore. The steady backbeat of Jamaican culture, and the sound systems that gave birth to the original 00s garage and grime crews, are all deeply entrenched in Kano’s offering, audibly on Caribbean-leaning tracks such as Can’t Hold We Down.Although this gig is a celebration of how far Kano has come in six albums, and a testament to how nuanced his iteration of grime can be, the raw materials here remain true to source. Kano has always rhymed hard and fast, even for a musical form full of fraught bpms and mercurial spitting. Neither maturity, nor changing fashions in flows, have dimmed his reference-packed delivery.His control is foregrounded from the off, on opening track Free Years Later – a reference to the time elapsed since 2016’s Made in the Manor, Kano’s account of his Newham upbringing. It’s the first of three songs from Hoodies All Summer, all themed around the senseless black-on-black violence besieging communities already laid low by endemic deprivation and racism.“Black tie Trouser creaseAnother funeral Another rest in peace,” he accuses in a disgusted staccato on Good Youtes Walk Amongst Evil, “welcome to my city.”Trouble, meanwhile, is the new album’s moving centrepiece, in which a young boy is gunned down in the middle of the song. The musicians halt. Screams, sirens and an anguished 999 call reverberate around the darkened Albert Hall. After a beat, the choir file on to sorrowfully intone “Trouble… we don’t want no trouble,” and Kano stands silent, spotlit, his face in his hand. The place breaks into wild cheering, before the track starts up again. Mindful of the need not to piously lecture, Kano has a variety of points to make. “The beef, please drop it cos it don’t make money,” he sings – another recent development – at the end. He makes reference to the delicacy of his position, portraying a ruthless dealer on TV while urging change in his music.Another strand to Kano’s lyricism finds him putting street aggro to one side and dwelling on ordinary life, with vignettes of normal people just spending their time. T-shirt Weather in the Manor is a high point tonight from Made in the Manor, in which barbecues and ice-cream vans figure lyrically and a good-time party spirit prevails for a while. It ends, though, with a jaded flow from Kano, mourning that loss of innocence.However varied an artist Kano has become, the energy definitely peaks for the straight-up grime tracks, with a moshpit forming for Kano’s ancient 2007 breakthrough track, P’s and Q’s (another rewind, trombones to the fore). Fast-forward over a decade and the spirit of the good old, bad old days of pirate radio station Deja Vu FM is revived on Class of Deja, in which Kano goes head to head with his former Nasty Crew cohorts D Double E (a mentor figure to the young Kano) and Ghetts, also long since a solo MC in his own right – or, as the track has it, “legends assemble”. The three ferocious MCs recount the days in which they climbed on to housing estate roofs with temporary aerials. They could have asked for three microphones – this is, after all, a classy joint. Instead, the three ferocious MCs pass the one mic between them, old school, sharing sweat and spittle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee51b91cfe087186806002db7323691b061cc10c/0_146_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91979bf266d1ff138416b067954f4db7","title":"silver lake seraglio english touring opera eto review eno orpheus underworld miss julie barbican","story":"Hackney Empire Coliseum Barbican, LondonHumanity wins out in a compelling English Touring Opera season from which ENO’s misjudged Offenbach could learn muchWe can be better people. This truth, simply expressed, is key to both works in English Touring Opera’s autumn season. Morals and happy endings can make dull art. To say ETO’s productions hit home because of the times we live in is certainly the case. It shouldn’t obscure the quality, deftness and originality of these two shows, staged on a tight budget and adaptable for eight different venues. Mozart’s Die Entführung aus dem Serail, sung in English as The Seraglio, and Kurt Weill’s The Silver Lake will tour from Durham to Exeter in the coming weeks. Each piece, contrasting in nearly every respect but both characterised by the use of spoken dialogue, makes you think, listen and feel.At Hackney Empire, members of Streetwise Opera joined a well-drilled chorus. Different local choirs will participate in every locality. If ETO did nothing else, that logistical task alone would be an achievement. The Silver Lake – Der Silbersee – by Kurt Weill and Georg Kaiser, first performed in Germany in 1933 three weeks after Hitler became chancellor, and banned by the Nazis as degenerate, has a greater generosity than the composer’s later collaborations with Brecht.Yet its satire remains sharp, attacking political extremism, exposing the effects of poverty, pillorying the rich. The skilful cast, led by David Webb (Severin), Ronald Samm (Olim) and Luci Briginshaw (Fennimore), excelled. James Holmes, a Weill expert, conducted a performance that was rhythmically taut but jazzy and flexible. Staged and in large part conceived by ETO’s artistic director, James Conway, this play-with-music built to a compelling climax. Humanity wins the day.Thanks to Adam Wiltshire’s designs, it was a short step from the bare, cage-scaffold structure of the Weill to the lavish, Topkapi-inspired prison of the Pasha’s harem in Mozart’s The Seraglio. Acknowledging but surmounting stereotype – this is a tale of Christians and Muslims that turns out well – Stephen Medcalf’s traditional but never staid production emphasised humour and tenderness. Lucy Hall as Konstanze and John-Colyn Gyeantey as Belmonte were secure in the vocally challenging “straight” roles. Alex Andreou put flesh on the spoken role of Pasha, which can on occasion be wooden. Matthew Stiff’s big-hearted, bullying Osmin, Richard Pinkstone’s impish Pedrillo and Nazan Fikret’s no-messing Blonde provoked ready laughter. Comic antics never fought with the fertile invention of Mozart’s music, incisively and insightfully conducted by John Andrews. Die Entführung, sometimes overshadowed, shone here in all its genius. ETO’s versatile orchestra, classy woodwind section deserving top marks in both operas, gave their all.Space is too limited – the gods smile occasionally – to permit too detailed an account of English National Opera’s new staging of Offenbach’s Orpheus in the Underworld (185874), conducted by Sian Edwards, directed by Emma Rice (ex-Shakespeare’s Globe) in her operatic debut, designed by Lizzie Clachan. Offenbach lampooned, with exquisite precision, any social or political target in his line of vision. The death of a baby was not one. This was the extraneous scene-setter in Rice’s new version, complete with “Baby” floral wreath and tiny coffin. The image indelibly imprinted on our mind’s eye, all joy was smothered in the opening minutes. It was the prelude to a night of flat jokes and dramatic miscalculations.Striving for positives: ENO’s cast had inidual strengths – Mary Bevan as a spirited Eurydice, Ed Lyon making the most of the slight title role, Alex Otterburn terrific as a sleazy Pluto, Willard White bemused as Jupiter but singing seductively and nobly as ever. The American baritone Lucia Lucas, in a promising ENO debut as Public Opinion, was coerced into cockney cabbie mode. A US limo driver might have fitted better with the Beverly Hills-style Mount Olympus of Clachan’s sets. Witty one-liners were lost, the words of the ensemble of gods inaudible (with the exceptions of Anne-Marie Owens and Keel Watson), unless you stayed glued to the subtitles.Everyone needed more direction: either towards choreographed exactitude or to anarchic freedom. Each would have worked. Comedic purgatory is no destination for Orpheus in any telling of the story. The chorus, wearing white balloon-tutus, injected what energy they could. Edwards coaxed some eloquent if still too stately playing from the orchestra. It may quicken into life as confidence grows in the many performances of this run. All three stars are awarded to the performers.No such uncertainty with William Alwyn’s Miss Julie (1977), long neglected and receiving a semi-staging (by Kenneth Richardson) by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sakari Oramo, with a top quartet of soloists led by Anna Patalong, sensational, strong and vulnerable in the title role. Benedict Nelson, a heroic late replacement, was chillingly convincing as the conniving Jean, given perceptive support by Rosie Aldridge as the cook-lover Kristin and Samuel Sakker as the drunken Ulrik.Alwyn (1905-85), best known for his film scores, wrote his own libretto based on August Strindberg’s tragedy. The opera’s emotional style, cinematic and impassioned, hardly sat well amid the atonal sobriety favoured in the mid-1970s. We’re over such heinous isions, in music anyway. Time for a full staging.

He is 12 months into a three-year farewell tour that has sold out arenas and sports stadiums around the world, and earned some of the most rapturous reviews of his 50-year career. “The last time I had notices like this I had a full head of hair and the writer had to spend half the review explaining who I was,” is how he puts it. His musical biopic Rocketman has grossed nearly $200m at the box office. And he’s about to publish his autobiography, Me.Full disclosure: I spent three and half years working with John on the book. I was both delighted and impossibly flattered to be asked, but work on it got off to a deeply peculiar start. The first interviews took place on the set of Kingsman: The Golden Circle, in which he had a cameo role that involved wearing one of his old stage costumes. Thus, I enjoyed the disconcerting experience of interviewing Elton John while he was dressed as Elton John in 1974: an outfit entirely made up of multicoloured marabou feathers, a headdress covered in jewels and mirrored glass, and a pair of silver platform boots with ELTON written on them in giant red letters. “Of course I can walk in them,” he frowned, when I mentioned the latter. “Listen, I’ve jumped off pianos in bigger platforms than these. It’s like riding a bike – you don’t forget.”But however mind-boggling he looked, it was nothing compared with what came out of his mouth: a succession of stories about his life in 1975 – when he was both the biggest pop star in the world and horribly depressed – so lurid that I assumed they’d never make it past the first draft. But they all ended up in the book. No spoilers, but put it this way: you’ll never look at a snooker table in the same way again.There are lots of reasons why Elton John has earned national treasure status, most obviously his ability to write songs that have become part of the fabric of life, but high on the list is that it’s hard to think of another member of the rock aristocracy blessed with such a self-deprecating sense of humour, or such a keen sense that, from the moment he set foot on stage at the LA Troubadour in 1970 – a gig that transformed him into a star – his life has been completely ridiculous. He talked a lot about the danger of losing touch with who he really was – a gifted but shy, music-obsessed boy from a council house in Pinner. But listening to him, that was what he sounded like: someone who, for all his talent, couldn’t quite believe the way it had all turned out.Today I ask him the questions we have been sent, and he is charmingly, fan-ishly delighted that one is from Bob Dylan (Dylan stopping him and Taupin on the stairs of a New York venue and telling them he liked their songs was one of the pair’s first “What the hell is happening to us?” moments). He dissolves into laughter recalling the late Freddie Mercury’s way with words, or John Lennon’s attempts to come up with his own drag name. And he is admirably unfazed by the tone-lowering line of inquiry pursued by rapper Eminem: once again, no subject seems is off limits.This is a very good question. Tiny Dancer has a really long lyric, a very cinematic, California-in-the-early-70s lyric, so it had two verses and a middle eight before it even gets to the chorus, and it lent itself to a long buildup. The middle eight sets it up well, then it slows down for a moment – “when I say softly, slowly…” That line suggested a big chorus. I don’t remember much about writing it, but I do remember trying to make it sound as Californian as possible. Writing a song like that’s a bit like having a wank, really. You want the climax to be good, but you don’t want it to be over too quickly – you want to work your way up to it. Bernie’s lyric took such a long time to get to the chorus, I thought, “Fuck, the chorus had better be something special when it finally arrives.” And it’s “here I come”, literally.Ah, no. Eminem bought me and David matching cock rings when we got married. That was his gift. They sit there, like the crown jewels, in this beautiful box on satin cushions. They’re wonderful to look at. I don’t know if any guests we’ve had have used them. God, I hope not. They’re kind of sacrosanct. The fact they came from Eminem makes it even better. It’s very him, as is this question. I call him up every couple of months, and every time he picks up the phone he says the same thing: “Hello, you old cunt, how are you?” Justin Timberlake says the same thing, actually.Billie Jean King, tennis champion and founder of the Billie Jean King Leadership InitiativeBillie Jean has always gone on about We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions by Queen being the ultimate sports songs. I couldn’t ask Bernie to sit down and write a lyric like that – he’s not that kind of writer. We wrote Philadelphia Freedom for Billie Jean’s tennis team, the Philadelphia Freedoms, but it’s not really about tennis Bernie just wrote about Philadelphia. And to be honest, We Are The Champions can’t be beaten: it’s so good at what it does, any sport can use it. Queen had that market sewn up, which was hysterical, because Freddie Mercury hated sport he knew nothing about it at all. If you’d mentioned Arsenal to Freddie, he’d have thought it was something to do with gay sex.The challenges I had were shyness and my sexuality. I’ve always tried to be honest. I didn’t hide my sexuality from myself or people around me – as soon as I realised I was gay, I told everyone I knew it didn’t give me a hang-up. Shyness never really held me back – a lot of creative people are shy and pull themselves out of that on stage. It’s when you come off stage and you’re stuck with yourself again that the problems start. I found challenges hard to overcome until I got sober, because I didn’t know how to deal with them.Being sober is all about asking for help to get through challenges. You can’t just barrel through and do things yourself – you have to reach out. It took me a long time to get where I am now: I was too trusting, I didn’t like confrontations, so I made bad decisions, especially in business. The fear of confrontation went back to my childhood, my parents rowing all the time, and it really held me back. It became less and less when I got sober, but it’s still there. It doesn’t magically disappear.I wouldn’t have minded writing Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road, but I think The Joke by Brandi Carlile. I just love it, I’ve played it continuously. It’s just the kind of song I could have written, quite Elton-ish. It’s the song that launched her into the stratosphere after seven albums – it was nominated for four Grammys. She’s a friend, I love her and people are now giving her the respect she deserves.Well, he wasn’t annoying, but I was perplexed when I went to work with Timbaland, the hip-hop producer. I did a track for him in Las Vegas for his Shock Value album. I loved his work, so I went to the studio, said hello and just sat at the piano and wrote this song. He’s obviously quite shy, and while I was writing it, he didn’t really communicate with me. He was making beats with some other guy. I’m there for three or four hours, trying to write something really good, and all I was hearing in my headphones was him messing around with beats, no feedback at all. He didn’t tell me he liked it, didn’t tell me he didn’t like it. It was confusing I was convinced I was doing something wrong. When I left, he just said, “See you again”, and I thought, “Well, maybe you won’t”: I was crestfallen, a bit angry.Anyway, the next day he rang up and said: “Hey man, it’s fucking genius. I love you, sorry if I didn’t communicate, I’m really shy.” And the track turned out brilliantly. It’s called Two Man Show. The funny thing is, the finished song’s got him going “I like that… yeah… don’t it sound good to you, don’t you agree?” over my piano part. So it was fine in the end. I still love him to death.Cara Delevingne, model and actorFrom the past, I would love to have been Elizabeth Taylor, because (a) she was fucking talented and brilliant, (b) she was beautiful, (c) she had a lot of sex, and (d) she had the most fantastic jewellery. And she became one of the world’s greatest philanthropists. I mean, it’s a very easy choice. She was a very dear friend of mine. She had an absolutely filthy sense of humour, very British. It’s hard to pick someone from today, because there are so many candidates, but I think I’d choose Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand. She’s one of the few politicians that I respect and love – she’s got dignity and she’s humane. I think she’s doing a brilliant job.It started when I was a kid. My mum and dad would be shouting at each other, or shouting at me, and I’d run to my room, where I had my records, my toys, my books. They were like my best friends – they didn’t shout at me. I kept them in pristine condition – I started really valuing objects. Then when I first started making money, I collected art nouveau and art deco. And I’m capable of getting rid of stuff. Just before I got sober, I sold everything. But I didn’t stop collecting, I just started collecting different things. Photography, obviously, but also napkin rings, china and tablewear, which Gianni Versace got me into. The real gay me came out when I was sober! I’d love to be a minimalist, but I just have to accept what I am. I’m a magpie. You learn about things by collecting – you buy things, you read up about them, you learn. I mean, I could write a book about napkin rings, but I don’t think it would be a very big seller.Victoria Beckham, designer and Spice GirlTheo Fennell, the jeweller, and his wife Louise. They’ve been my friends for about 35 years and are just the nicest, funniest people. If you have people on holiday with you, you have to have funny people, and Theo is one of the funniest people I know. I’ve never had a dull moment with them in all the time I’ve known them.Obviously Posh. Although, there was a side of me before I got sober that would definitely have been Mel B.I have absolutely no idea. Donatella’s talking about addiction here. I am responsible for helping a lot of people get sober and hopefully to stay sober. That’s your responsibility, and it’s part of the process. You give them your phone number, you take theirs, you make sure you phone them, check up on them, see they’re OK – that’s what I did with Eminem.I remember very, very well the night Donatella decided to go for help. It was an intervention, which isn’t always the best way of doing things – if people aren’t ready for it, it turns into a disaster. With Donatella, I knew she was ready, because she came to see me play a show in Reggio Calabria three weeks beforehand. She was in a terrible state, and I knew she was giving me a message: “I need help, I need this now, I’m at my lowest ebb.” She didn’t take much persuading to go.Some people, you try and they just don’t want to know. George Michael was like that. He did go away to Switzerland for a while, but he was too stubborn. It was weird when he died, Ozzy Osbourne said to me, “You know what, Elton? I don’t think he wanted to be here any more”, which seems like a harsh thing to say, but I think it was right. He didn’t want to be here. He had a choice, he knew what he had to do and he wouldn’t do it. So there you go.Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and MalariaBackstage at Live Aid, I had a huge area that I kind of decorated. I made sure there were seats for everyone, so that people who were playing could sit down and have a natter. Freddie came over after Queen had stolen the show. I said, “Freddie, nobody should go on after you – you were magnificent.” He said: “You’re absolutely right, darling, we were – we killed them.” He was so excited. Then he said, “You, on the other hand, dear – you looked like the fucking Queen Mother when you were on stage. Where did you get that absolutely awful hat?” That was very Freddie. He was hilarious. Even when he was dying, he was exactly the same. He was lying in bed, too weak to stand, losing his sight, going: “Have you heard Mrs Bowie’s new album, darling? What does she think she’s doing?” I always had the best time with him.In the 60s, I was in a band that played soul music – we started out playing blues and switched to soul. I used to sing My Girl by The Temptations, and we got to play as the backing band for Lee Dorsey, Major Lance, Patti LaBelle and Billy Stewart. I learned a lot just by watching them every night. I never consciously tried to imitate soul singers – you have to be authentic in what you do. But it’s my favourite type of music, I’ve always loved it. It has the best singers – Marvin Gaye, Bobby Womack, Levi Stubbs from The Four Tops, the Detroit Spinners, the Stylistics – and obviously I’ve listened to so much of it, a little bit rubbed off. I’ve had three records at No 1 on the US R\u0026ampB chart: Bennie And The Jets, Philadelphia Freedom and Mama Can’t Buy You Love, which was incredibly flattering.It was very difficult to be a girl in the 50s. I didn’t enjoy the 50s much – it was all people peering out from behind their net curtains and being judgmental. For a girl, sexuality wasn’t talked about – if she got pregnant, she was sent away in disgrace. It’s harder for women, period, but especially in the 50s. They were looked upon by boys as sex objects and nothing more – you know, “I can’t wait to get a bit of tit.” I had female friends at school, and I obviously didn’t look at them as a potential bit of tit, but that’s how they were seen.If I had the same musical desires, of course I would have tried to follow them, but it would have been so much harder. There were no role models for female musicians at the time – boys had dozens, but all the female artists were singers there were no role models for songwriters and musicians. There was Honey Lantree, who played drums in The Honeycombs, and that was it. My dad thought it was disgraceful that I wanted to get involved in rock’n’roll. Can you imagine what it would have been like if I was a girl?Sophie Dahl, author and former modelI liked Alice In Wonderland, and I liked Peter Pan. I lived in my imagination a lot, and I loved to read: Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, Moby-Dick, Uncle Tom’s Cabin. That was what allowed your imagination to run riot – books and listening to the radio. There was no TV, or at least we didn’t have one at that point, so you were forced to visualise stuff yourself. And I think that helped me when I became a songwriter. With Bernie’s lyrics, I could put images to his words very quickly, because I had a great visual imagination. So with something like Tiny Dancer, I could see the song, I could imagine what was going on straight away.When I was younger, everything about touring was incredibly exciting. We were running on adrenaline and everything was a new experience, even getting on a plane. Now I try and come home after shows as often as I can. If I’m staying in the city I play in, I go to photography galleries, museums. I go shopping, I see friends for lunch. It’s hard if you’re in the middle of nowhere – but if that’s the case, I always take a book of crosswords.Jonathan Freeman-Attwood, principal, the Royal Academy of MusicIn a heartbeat. I knew I wasn’t going to be a classical pianist – my hands are too small and I wanted to be a rock’n’roll player. But it was a wonderful place, even if it was full of fear – it was strict, they hated anything that wasn’t classical music, although it’s very different now. I learned so much from being in the choir, from the other musicians, from the teachers. You can hear it in the Elton John album: The King Must Die, The Greatest Discovery, Sixty Years On. I’d advise anyone to get formal training, because it teaches you the rudiments – chord structure, melody. It introduces you to music that’s beautiful and miles away from what you might do. It fills your mind with options.My manor! Woodside, my house in Windsor, is meant to be haunted, but I’ve never seen a ghost and I’ve lived there since 1974. David saw her, though. It was a Victorian lady. She sat on the bed and asked him if he could stop the noise outside – there were deer rutting in the park. David was very calm. I’d have been frightened to death!I did see a ghost once, in a hotel in Belgium that used to be a convent. I went to bed and felt something pressing down on my chest. I was too terrified to move. So, strictly speaking, I haven’t seen a ghost, but I have been sat on by one.My cousin, Roy Dwight, was a professional footballer. He played for Fulham, so as a kid I used to sit on the touchline at Craven Cottage and watch him. This is how old I am – Jimmy Hill was playing for Fulham at the time. And then my dad took me to see Watford, because they were our local team. I was six or seven. I fell in love with the whole experience. And that was it. You can’t shake your team: it’s in your blood and your bones, even when they’re completely shit. Obviously, when they’re doing well it’s wonderful, but the other week they lost 8-0 to Manchester City and I wanted to crawl into a hole and die. But you can’t support anyone else. Watford are my team, and I’m glad. I never thought I’d end up owner of the club, or a director, but Watford saved my life. Working with them kept me grounded when my life was going completely crazy – it reminded me of my roots, of who I really was. I’m forever grateful to them. Except when they lose 8-0. I’m not very grateful then.• Me by Elton John is published by Pan Macmillan on 15 October at £25. To order a copy for £18.75, go to bookshop. Free UK p\u0026ampp on all online orders over £15.

The Democratic Unionist party and European Research Group (ERG), a group of rightwing Conservatives, later issued statements promising flexibility, keeping hope alive that Johnson could find support for a new offer in the House of Commons.But amid ongoing scepticism that a deal could be forced through in the short time left and with Angela Merkel due to hold talks with Emmanuel Macron on Sunday night, the prime minister faces a frantic race to push through his fresh proposals with Brussels or at home.“The UK has accepted that there is not a deal that involves a border on the island of Ireland – that is a big break from what they were saying,” one EU source said. “Now the key is for them to lay out how their new position over the weekend.”On Friday, Johnson twice refused to deny that Northern Ireland could still stay in the EU’s customs territory after Brexit when asked by reporters on Friday.“I think it would be wrong of me to give a running commentary on the negotiations,” he said. “With the greatest possible respect I think, look at everything I’ve said previously. I think you can draw your own conclusions from that. But let our negotiators get on.”Johnson added: “I can certainly tell you that under no circumstances will we see anything that damages the ability of the whole of the United Kingdom to take full advantage of Brexit, and I think that’s what people would expect, and that’s what I think we can achieve.”Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.The \u0027backstop\u0027 in Theresa May\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a \u0027trap\u0027 to keep the UK in the EU\u0027s customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals.\u0026nbspInteractive: A typical hour in the life of the Irish borderDuring a briefing of EU ambassadors on Friday, Michel Barnier did not go into the detail of the UK’s new position. But he informed the diplomats that his two-hour breakfast with the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, had been notable for the apparent pivot by the British government.Following a meeting in the Wirral on Thursday, Johnson and Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, had agreed that they could see a “pathway” to a deal.One option the EU might accept is a scaled-down version of the customs partnership proposed by Theresa May in 2017.Under the plan, Northern Ireland would leave the EU customs union but the UK would agree to enforce the bloc’s customs rules and tariffs on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. There would be a rebate system to compensate businesses impacted.But EU sources suggested that there would not be sufficient time to work out the detail for the UK to leave on 31 October. “You don’t reinvent the wheel in five days,” said one senior diplomat. “We are still looking at an extension.”EU sources said Johnson had suggested to them that the DUP could be convinced by his recast vision for the border.The leader of the party, Arlene Foster, said on Friday her party of 10 MPs admitted “the need to be flexible and look at Northern Ireland specific solutions” in a statement.Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and chair of the ERG, said he and other members can “glimpse the possibility of this being a tolerable deal, however they want to see the wording of any agreement and expect a full briefing from No 10.The ERG has around 30 MPs in its group who consistently blocked May’s Brexit deal and are seen as a vital cohort to win over for Johnson to succeed.“We are all warmly disposed to backing a tolerable deal but until we have got a text we can’t say what we are going to do,” Baker told the .“I’ve been very, very, clear that the whole of the UK should leave the EU together. I’m not going to do anything until I can read the text of the agreement.”In EU capitals there remains considerable doubt that there is a viable solution in the pipeline that could be signed off by leaders at an EU summit next Thursday. A European commission spokesman formally announced the intensification of talks, as first revealed by the , in a statement reasserting its unmoved position.“The EU and the UK have agreed to intensify discussions over the coming days,” the commission’s statement said. “The EU’s position remains the same: there must be a legally operative solution in the withdrawal agreement that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland, protects the all-island economy and the Good Friday (Belfast) agreement in all its dimensions, and safeguards the integrity of the single market.”EU diplomats said “ideas” and “elements” had been raised by Barclay that would “allow the negotiation teams to continue their efforts in search of a positive outcome”.Earlier in the day, the European council president, Donald Tusk, said he had set the prime minister an ultimatum of presenting new Brexit proposals by Friday or “no more chances”. He cautiously welcomed Wednesday’s developments in Wirral.Tusk warned, however, that “time was practically up” and there was “no guarantee” of success.“Johnson promised the EU to come forward with a solution that would work for all,” he said. “A solution that would not only satisfy the hardcore Brexiters but also solve our well-known and legitimate objectives: to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, to protect the Good Friday agreement, and ensure the integrity of the single market.“Unfortunately we are still in a situation in which the UK has not come forward with a workable realistic proposal.”A customs union means that countries agree to apply no or very low tariffs to goods sold between them, and to collectively apply the same tariffs to imported goods from the rest of the world. International trade deals are then negotiated by the bloc as a whole.For the EU, this means deals are negotiated by by Brussels, although inidual member state governments agree the mandate and approve the final deal. The EU has trade deals covering 69 countries, including Canada and South Korea, which the UK has been struggling to roll over into post-Brexit bilateral agreements.Proponents of an independent UK trade policy outside the EU customs union say Britain must forge its own deals if it is to take advantage of the world’s fastest-growing economies. However they have never explained why Germany manages to export more than three times the value in goods to China than Britain does, while also being in the EU customs union.Tusk said he told Johnson a week ago that “if there were no such proposals by today I would announce publicly that there are no more chances – because of objective reasons – for a deal for the incoming European council”.“However, yesterday, when the Irish taoiseach and the UK prime minister met they both saw for the first time a pathway to a deal. I have received promising signals from the taoiseach that a deal is still possible.”Tusk added that there was “no guarantee of success and the time is practically up, but even the slightest chance must be used”. “A no-deal Brexit will never be the choice of the EU”, he said. Johnson’s controversial offer that the DUP would have a veto on post-Brexit border relations might also be removed as talks continue, one Tory MP said.“I think we would end up without the current consent veto, but some mechanism developed whereby the Irish parliament and Stormont have a say over the exit.“The DUP would be surrendering their veto and Sinn Fein would be getting a vote twice effectively on it, but for lack of anything better, that might be the solution where we might be had.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a29f62d7a0fcddd8dc7a3dd16818f771b429437/0_1162_2845_1706/master/2845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=542bed4a9b6bc62a1276e8a7263b0bfe","title":"brexit deal prospects look promising nicky morgan","story":"Minister voices hopes of progress after talks between UK and Ireland over borderThe prospects of a Brexit deal with the EU appear to be “promising” after negotiations between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar over the Irish border, Nicky Morgan has said.A day after the British prime minister signalled the possibility of a U-turn on his plans, the culture secretary said the “mood music … seems positive, but clearly there are lots of details to be worked out.”She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There are strong views on all sides and I imagine we’ll all find out around the EU council next week exactly what has happened between the two sides.”On Friday, EU sources said Johnson had conceded there could not be a customs border on the island of Ireland – a critical step away from his previous position. Officials are continuing talks in Brussels over the weekend after the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, gave the go-ahead for intensive negotiations to start.However, Morgan would not be drawn on details of the discussions because “there are subtle nuances with all of these things”.She added: “It’s a question of what is negotiated between the parties and obviously it also has to satisfy people living in Northern Ireland, who are very much at the heart of all of this, and to be approved by members of parliament.”The Democratic Unionist party and the European Research Group of rightwing Conservatives issued statements promising flexibility, keeping hope alive that Johnson could find support for a new offer in the House of Commons.But the prime minister faces a frantic race to push through a deal before 31 October.

I think it is incumbent on all of us to stand back from briefings and speculation and just allow these talks to happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35e360f7b93fee45e54a3a3e6bba6354c592da65/74_0_4235_2542/master/4235.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f24c83efa8ab280f1a99be19900cd0fb","title":"crunch time for corbyn labour enforcer sidelined as nerves jangle","story":"Karie Murphy was quietly moved on as the opposition frets over whether it is ready for governmentJeremy Corbyn’s advisers joke that their private strapline for the looming general election is: “Downing Street or the dole.” Everyone at the top of the Labour party is gearing up for a gruelling campaign – but they’re also starting to imagine life afterwards.When one of Corbyn’s key lieutenants, Karie Murphy, was quietly shifted aside last week, the official line was that she was keeping her title of chief of staff, and would move to Labour’s HQ in Victoria to oversee the party’s election campaign.But her departure was the most public signal yet of deep disquiet at the very top of the party about whether Labour is ready for government – or if Corbyn loses another general election, what might come next.Corbyn’s close allies John McDonnell and Diane Abbott have been pressuring him to move Murphy for months, citing unhappiness among the 30-plus staff in his office, and the concern she was one of those acting as a brake on Labour’s shift towards supporting a second referendum.Charismatic and tough, Murphy often held the combative conversations Corbyn tends to avoid, but McDonnell and others came to believe she was taking too many decisions on her boss’s behalf. As one ally said: “Karie had lapsed into thinking she ran Jeremy. Thankfully that era is over.”The catalyst for sidelining her was the botched attempt to abolish Tom Watson’s post of deputy leader, on the eve of the Labour conference.The move was blamed at the time on the Momentum chair, Jon Lansman, who tabled the motion at the national executive committee (NEC). But friends say Lansman willingly became the fall guy, to shield Corbyn from direct responsibility. understands that while Corbyn had been infuriated by Watson’s speech calling for Labour to become an out-and-out remain party, and his allies had discussed ways of isolating Watson, the Labour leader had specifically asked for no action to be taken before conference.Murphy, his tough-minded enforcer, pressed ahead, reportedly telling colleagues it was too late to back out. Afterwards, according to two people present, the mild-mannered Corbyn fumed that the chaos made Labour look like “fucking student politicians”. He was forced to step in publicly and defend Watson.And as he and Watson sat alongside each other on the front bench in Westminster later that week, the deputy leader also showed Corbyn a screenshot of flyers handed out in Brighton calling on delegates to disrupt his speech – which he believed had the imprimatur of the leader’s office.Ironically, the putsch had the reverse effect to that intended by the plotters, and gave Watson a new lease of life.He had seemed to colleagues to be increasingly detached in recent weeks, causing some to speculate that he could follow his friend Luciana Berger to the Lib Dems, perhaps taking 20 or so colleagues with him. Instead, he arrived in Brighton emboldened and invigorated.The other factor in Murphy’s departure was the resignation of Andrew Fisher, who lashed out against the leader of the opposition’s office (Loto) in a furious parting email.Extracts were leaked to the Sunday Times. But after news of the shakeup in Loto emerged on Tuesday, the hyper-partisan website Skwawkbox – widely regarded in Labour circles as Murphy’s mouthpiece – published the entire note. The picture it painted was less of ruthless ideological shock troops, more of chaos, ision and simmering discontent.The revered elections expert David Butler said last week that he had “never felt more confused and uncertain” about the outcome of the coming election.Corbyn loyalists hope that as in 2017, Labour will be able to reframe the campaign, away from Johnson’s “Get Brexit Done” message, and return to the domestic agenda that worked so well for it in 2017 – though that may be much less effective when the Tories are talking incessantly about funding schools, hospitals and police officers.If Johnson returns with the solid majority he craves, however, McDonnell has conceded that he and Corbyn would have to step aside.And with Brexit cutting across the party’s traditional left-right ide, it is very unclear whether they would be followed by a candidate who shares their political perspective. “It will be chaos,” says one leftwing MP.Corbyn’s victory over Brexit policy on the conference floor in Brighton underlined the intense loyalty he still commands from Labour members. “This is Jeremy’s party!” said one jubilant shadow minister at the time.But his longtime allies are also well aware that none of their favoured successors – Rebecca Long-Bailey, Laura Pidcock – are likely to inspire the same devotion.Internal polling earlier this year suggested Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry were the most favoured successors among members, with Watson some distance behind, according to insiders.Earlier in the year, Starmer was rumoured to have struck up what colleagues jokingly called a “bromance” with McDonnell. It would have seen McDonnell dominate economic policy, while Starmer led the party, a 21st-century version of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s Granita pact. But the pair deny they were ever considering a deal, and McDonnell made clear in Brighton that he believed the next leader must be a woman.First, though, the party will have to hold together through a potentially rocky general election, with a carefully constructed compromise policy on Brexit. Corbyn’s allies have allowed themselves to be dragged a long way over the past 12 months by a membership for whom, as one puts it, “remain is a feeling”.But Starmer and other remainer MPs fear it may not be far enough. One thing appears certain, as all the major parties fire up the battle buses for this most unpredictable of elections: as one leftwing MP puts it, “it’s shit or bust for project Corbyn”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f612b28b3febfb487440d6afd81a201de25d2e24/212_134_5448_3268/master/5448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=138136bbea2ca0da70fc2a9692d9d005","title":"sadiq khan calls for labour to back second referendum before election","story":"Exclusive: London mayor says party should back remain to outflank Lib DemsSadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has called on Jeremy Corbyn to opt for a second referendum before a general election, saying it would be both electorally damaging and fundamentally wrong to continue with the party’s current Brexit policy.Khan, one of the party’s most powerful office-holders, called on Labour to ballot its members on whether the party should immediately back remaining in the EU, branding the existing position a “fudge” that risked losing the next election.Speaking at his offices in City Hall, he said it was both “the wrong policy and also electorally bad” for the party to go into an imminent general election without telling voters Labour is in favour of staying in the EU.“I am not sure, bearing in mind how big Brexit is, that we can have a general election and argue on NHS, policing, schools, the environment with Brexit not being resolved and our position being so unclear it’s bad politics and the wrong place for us to be,” he said.In a wide-ranging interview six months before Khan comes up for re-election as mayor, he said his decision to speak out was not related to any worries about his own prospects, arguing that he had always been clearly pro-remain. Instead, he claimed he felt obliged to warn the national party against making a huge mistake.His intervention comes at a time when Corbyn is under increasing pressure from senior shadow cabinet members to agree to a second referendum before an election, with many of them arguing it is crucial to first get Brexit sorted. The party is trailing in the polls, with the Lib Dems appearing to attract pro-remain voters with their position in favour of revoking Brexit, while Labour continues to refuse to say which way it would campaign in a second referendum.The mayor launched a fresh broadside at Labour’s Brexit policy just three weeks after the party’s autumn conference, at which delegates backed Corbyn’s policy of fighting an election promising to negotiate a Labour-backed Brexit deal then putting that to a public vote.Khan said this position “does not make sense” as the party risked losing leave-backing voters to the Tories and Brexit party anyway, while seeing many remain voters go to the Lib Dems. But he also said it was wrong for Labour to be swayed by the argument that some of its heartlands are pro-Brexit, saying the party should take a lead in the same way it has tackled racism in society, championed the NHS and fought for women’s rights.“Can you imagine in the early 20th century Keir Hardie being told this women’s right to vote stuff is a bit tricksy on the doorstep in Doncaster and Wigan and I’m not sure we should be doing this,” he said. “My dad came to this country in the 1960s, and there were signs saying no blacks, no Irish, no dogs … Can you imagine if Labour leaders say: ‘In Wolverhampton there’s this poster that says: ‘If you want an N for a neighbour, vote Labour’, I’m not sure it’s electorally advantageous for us to run it past the Race Relations Act. Let’s not do it.’”Asked whether a second referendum should come before a general election, Khan said: “Absolutely. Let’s resolve the issue of Brexit, give the British public a final say. Leave the EU on terms negotiated by the government or the option of remaining. Once that’s been resolved, have a general election as soon as possible and we’ve got such an exciting policy offer when it comes to the NHS, policing, schools, a Green New Deal.”Khan’s position mirrors that of Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, also revealed on Thursday she had concerns about an election before Brexit was settled. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, are also understood to have raised concerns this week that stumbling into a quick general election could be a “trap” for Labour.However, Corbyn has so far repeatedly made clear that he will vote for an election as soon as no-deal Brexit is off the table.Khan said he was not necessarily worried about Labour trailing in the polls right now as they “go up and down” and the party gained ground during the campaign in 2017. But he said he was concerned about the scale of movement to the Lib Dems over Brexit at the European elections.He dismissed Corbyn’s argument that the party should decide how to campaign only after Labour has negotiated its own Brexit deal, saying: “There is no Brexit that is better than remaining in the EU.”Khan, who is up for re-election in May next year, said he had told Corbyn many times his own position and he believed there was further scope for the party to shift on its Brexit policy.As well as the Tory candidate Shaun Bailey and the Lib Dem Siobhan Benita, Khan is facing the independent candidacy of the former Tory MP Rory Stewart. But he said he was also not concerned about the newcomer to the race, who has made a name for himself doing a series of walks throughout the country talking to voters.“I walk all the time. What I don’t do is walk around London with an iPhone filming my walk,” he said. “And what I don’t do is treat Londoners like natives. We aren’t natives. We are people who enjoy walking around our city, whether it’s drinking in pubs, eating in cafes, eating in restaurants without being filmed. We don’t think there’s anything unique about that.”He said he looked forward to debating with Stewart if he was still a candidate in six months’ time.On climate emergency protesters Extinction Rebellion, who are halfway through their promised two-week period of action in central London, he said he feared they risked losing public sympathy .“As somebody who is sympathetic to the cause, you’re in danger of losing public opinion. There is a tipping point where your actions can lead to people rather than being sympathetic to having animosity towards you. That’s why it’s a real dilemma. That’s why the way to win over public opinion and keep it is protest lawfully and peacefully.”Asked if Extinction Rebellion had reached that tipping point, he said: “I’m not sure of the answer ... but as somebody sympathetic to the issue I do worry about public opinion not being won over but being lost.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5fca6e3685824d8b9bba53fab53c341781ad774/639_1035_5479_3288/master/5479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1958f04b1405ebc1a149c59f682d0cef","title":"brexit and the irish border is there a solution","story":"Lisa O’Carroll and Rory Carroll tell Anushka Asthana that solving the Irish border problem is still key to a Brexit deal. Plus: Wendy Laura Belcher on African literatureAfter nearly three years of intense negotiations, the Brexit talks appeared to break down this week as a “blame game” began over which side was responsible for the failure to agree a deal. Hostile briefings flowed out of Downing Street, enraging EU officials. Both sides now admit an agreement before the European council summit next week is unlikely. At the heart of all of this, one issue has remained unresolved: the Irish border. If the UK is determined to leave the EU single market and customs union, how does it comply with the Good Friday agreement and the necessity of an open border with the Republic of Ireland?  Joining Anushka Asthana to discuss it all are the ’s Brexit correspondent Lisa O’Carroll and Ireland correspondent Rory Carroll.  Also today: Wendy Laura Belcher, a professor of African literature at Princeton University, says she is often shocked by people who assume her subject is limited and narrow. On the contrary, she argues, African literature is vast and erse – and richly rewarding to study.

The event dramatically cooled the planet and triggered an ice age that was followed by major increases in numbers of new animal species.The work, led by Birger Schmitz of Lund University in Sweden, was recently published in Science Advances and provides new insight into the impact of interplanetary events on our planet’s evolution. “We know about the 10km asteroid that crashed on Earth 67 million years ago and killed off the dinosaurs, but this event was very different,” Schmitz told the Observer. “It occurred about 470 million years ago when an asteroid 3,000 times bigger than the dinosaurs-killer was destroyed during a collision with another asteroid beyond the orbit of Mars. It filled the solar system with dust and caused a major dimming of sunlight falling on Earth.”Reduced radiation caused Earth to cool significantly, setting off a succession of ice ages. Water froze, ice caps spread and sea levels dropped, creating isolated shallow seas that were ideal for generating new species. Cold water also holds more dissolved oxygen, which would also have boosted speciation. Scientists already knew ice ages appeared at this time and that life went through a spectacular increase in bioersity, particularly in the sea. The first coral reefs began to grow then, and strange tentacled predators called nautiloids appeared. This is known as the great Ordovician bioersification event, or Gobe.Scientists have argued over the cause of Gobe, but now Schmitz, after studying dust particles in seabed sediments laid down at this time, says it was triggered by clouds of asteroid dust. “The sediments laid down at this time are rich in the isotope helium-3 – which they could only have picked up travelling through space,” he said. “It is a crucial clue.”Other scientists have backed his idea. “It isn’t necessarily the answer to every question we have about Gobe, but it certainly ties together a lot of observations,” Rebecca Freeman, of the University of Kentucky, Lexington, told the journal Science recently.However, Schmitz’s research has also caused interest for another reason. As the world warms dangerously, some scientists have proposed spreading a veil of dust that would sit in space above the Earth and reflect sunlight away from our overheating planet. The idea is controversial because it could have many unpleasant side-effects, say critics.Now evidence shows such an experiment occurred naturally 470 million years ago. The result was a major change in our meteorology and the evolution of life here. “It is certainly worth bearing in my mind in coming years,” added Schmitz."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8816b6e29cc598e57e4fb984ae8e8a57c7ad4c0/0_113_2296_1377/master/2296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d728c900847929356a71047cac95599","title":"andy flower england cricket leaves role 12 years ashes","story":"Andy Flower is leaving the England and Wales Cricket Board after 12 years.

It’s difficult to win in Australia and to do it so comprehensively was a really proud moment in my coaching career.“It was wonderful to watch those young men take on that challenge successfully and have a great time doing it.

Even the strongest cynics – and they are not hard to come by – had to smile at the 500-metre final stretch that defined the making of history: the marathon distance has been completed in under two hours.Eliud Kipchoge had brushed aside his pacemakers. The Kenyan pointed to and waved at adoring galleries, 15 deep in the middle of a Vienna park, as he galloped towards athletic immortality. “That was the best moment in my life,” said Kipchoge of catching sight of the finish line. When he crossed it, the clock read 1:59:40.2. Amid inevitable, wide-ranging assessment of what this all means, at least this can be defined as a reference point for decades and generations to come.It was already known that Kipchoge is an extraordinary athlete. He merely pressed home the point on a misty morning in Austria. With the clock stopped and a sporting world looking on with awe, the 34-year-old Kenyan displayed all the physical strain of having walked for the morning papers.“I felt a lot of pressure yesterday,” Kipchoge admitted. “I received a lot of calls of encouragement from all over the world. The president of Kenya called me. When you receive so many calls from high-profile people, there is pressure.”Kipchoge described the period between a 4.50am wake-up call and his scheduled 8.15am start as the toughest of his life. What followed resembled blissful simplicity.Giddy comparisons to other sporting and historical acts were inevitable and duly forthcoming. It is altogether fair to reference Roger Bannister, who 65 years ago achieved what had been widely perceived as impossible by running a mile in under four minutes. That Kipchoge has entered the domain of first man on the moon Neil Armstrong – as some commentators claimed – is, however, a stretch.This was an operation afforded military levels of planning and an even loftier budget. Vienna had been preferred to London because of benign conditions. Kipchoge ran every kilometre between a range of 2:48 and 2:52. Teams of seven pacemakers – in a phalanx formation, 2-1-2-2 - not only kept Kipchoge on the right side of the clock but protected him from what little breeze existed.Ineos, a petrochemical company not exempt from bad publicity, reportedly ploughed £15m into this event. The brand was unavoidable, to the point where you could have suspected this was the key protagonist’s surname. Jim Ratcliffe, the company’s founder and richest man in the UK, sat alongside Kipchoge for his post-run press conference.Ratcliffe was afforded the kind of canned laughter as follows men of his wealth around. Dave Brailsford, seemingly unaffected by the controversy that attached itself to Team Sky which is now rebranded Team Ineos, was sat in the front row. When Kipchoge’s status as a Nike athlete - the sportswear giant wounded by the Alberto Salazar affair - is factored in, those seeking to detract from what transpired here are not short of ammunition. Kipchoge’s prototype running shoes will fly from shelves when eventually released to the public at £240 a pop. How much of this actually relates to man and muscle?Technological advancements are not unique to athletics. He is not at all troubled by the fact the IAAF does not recognise this feat as a record, a scenario perhaps impacted by the detail that he holds the world’s best official marathon time anyway.This was about breaking barriers and showing, as the marathon logo stated, that no human is limited. If that is true, presumably the glass ceiling for those famous 26.2 miles has yet to be reached.Kipchoge, essentially a modest sort, said he knew within the first kilometre than he would achieve his goal. He swatted aside one view that mid-race presented brief troubles. “That’s untrue,” Kipchoge said.It seemed incredible that the four-time London marathon winner trained for this pursuit for just four months. And the Saturday morning breakfast of champions? Oatmeal.The runner’s coach, Patrick Sang, cut one of many euphoric figures. “He has inspired all of us to stretch our limits in our lives,” said Sang. “Everything went perfectly. Records are meant to be broken, I’m sure someone down the road will want to try to break this one, but history has been made.”Kipchoge quietly exited to bestow an epic party on his 41 pacemakers. Pretty swiftly - if not in the territory of the man himself - this corner of Vienna returned to normality. Marathon running, meanwhile, will never be the same again. Oh, Vienna."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f8ee8216cabb91c85b10ee34fbf1659d63133a7/0_310_2184_1310/master/2184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb63ee6b74eb9a09d0425f130ea93ccb","title":"rugby world cup 2019 ireland samoa match report","story":"Fourteen-man Ireland booked a place in the quarter-finals against either South Africa or New Zealand with a bonus-point victory over an erratic and ill-disciplined Samoa. But whether or not they top Pool A remains in the hands of Typhoon Hagibis.If Sunday’s game between Scotland and Japan is cancelled, then the match will be declared a draw and both teams will receive two points – with Japan then going through as top seed from Pool A and playing South Africa. That would leave Joe Schmidt’s side facing champions New Zealand.Ireland won here despite playing for over 50 minutes with 14 men after Bundee Aki was sent off against the country of his ancestry for a dangerous tackle to the head of fly-half Ulupano Seuteni. It seemed a tough call on Aki by referee Nic Berry given that Samoan hooker Seilala Lam had seen only yellow in the sixth minute for a similar-looking challenge on Jacob Stockdale.It is just over 1,000km between the south west city of Fukuoka and Yokohama, but this match was played in the shadow of what was unfolding in the latter. The permutations that Typhoon Hagibis could inflict on Pool A are serious, but Ireland and Samoa had their own immediate conditions to worry about.Firm gusts swirled around the ground, an almost eerie reminder of what was happening around Yokohama. Ireland sought to use the wind to unsettle the Samoan back three with a persistent aerial attack, which worked early on but their kicking became wayward as the first half wore on.There is still plenty to work on for Ireland. Their scrum was penalised when put to its first test, and after Samoa got on the board Irish passing became temporarily sloppy. It was a big night for Rory Best, who captained Ireland for the 37th time, thereby overtaking fellow hooker Keith Wood and moving into second place behind Brian O’Driscoll in the list of players who have captained Ireland the most. Best has had his critics of late, not least due to some dysfunctional lineouts, but he delivered a firm rebuttal in just the fourth minute when he rumbled over from a lineout drive on Samoa’s 5m line.A bad start for Samoa then got worse when Lam was sent to the sin-bin. Only a suggestion of a dip into the tackle by Stockdale saved him from red. Seconds later, Tadhg Furlong left a handful of flailing bodies in his wake as he burrowed over. Sexton then converted his own score after limp Samoa defending enabled Jordan Larmour to wriggle through and sweetly pop the ball inside.Samoa were conceding a point a minute and facing a humiliating World Cup finale. Step forward captain Jack Lam, who finally brought Samoa to their senses with a try from short range. Aki was then red-carded for his dangerous challenge on Seuteni. Samoa have been no strangers to tough card calls this World Cup, and the sympathy from the back-tapping Pacific Islanders as Aki walked off was genuine.Still, it briefly galvanised the Samoans. Lam continued to carry hard, and their backs had fresh urgency. But for all that, Samoa remained weak when defending in their own 22. Ireland went down the blindside from a scrum, and it was all too easy for Sexton to score his second. Jordan Larmour scored Ireland’s fifth as Samoa’s penalty count began to climb. Sexton kicked the conversion and with half an hour to go he was replaced, to be kept safe for sterner battles ahead.Samoa had flanker TJ Ione yellow-carded for repeated infringements and CJ Stander then made Ireland’s forward pressure tell with a try. Andrew Conway added his name to the scoresheet too. It was a straightforward enough, stress-free win for Joe Schmidt’s side. But a far, far tougher challenge awaits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ad787ca570109a70292f22d1adb808e6e74ccaa/0_0_3500_2350/master/3500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4eba7cf6cf3ba3e178b7150a040c3dc2 700w","title":"ireland v samoa rugby world cup 2019 live","story":"All the minute by minute updates from Ireland’s convincing win over Samoa in their final Pool B gameThat’s it from me, thanks for your company and your emails. Hopefully will speak to you all again tomorrow for the Japan vs Scotland game.Here’s the match report for you all to cast your eyes over“It wasn’t that pretty, but look we got the job done. There was no panic when we went down to 14 and we continued to attack them. We built well and whatever happens tomorrow, happens”A controlled and perfunctorily effective peformance from Ireland even when down to 14 players - exactly what Schmidt’s dreams are made of. The forwards were excellent, and while the play was more Lisburn than Las Vegas, that won’t bother them at all as they move on with a bruising forwards platform to build on. McGrath chips it out from the scrum and that’s that. Ireland go on, Samoa go home.79 mins. Samoa nick the ball and have an attack into the Ireland half via a run from Fonotia, but they are are forcing it now and the ball is lost forward. This will allow Ireland to melt the clock away under the slow heat of many reset scrums.75 mins. Samoa win the lineout on the Ireland 5 metre. They send pretty much everyone in to drive it and force themselves and the ball over the line. Ref has given it on the field, but he wants the TMO to check the ball wasn’t lost build up.Ball was lost backwards by Faasalele, but because he then picked it up again to place it the ruling is he played the ball on the ground. Penalty Ireland and a soul-splintering decision for Samoa, albeit a correct one. 74 mins. Samoa run a nice backs pattern, popping inside to Tuala who is in off his wing, but the pass was forward. Samoa get a nudge on the Ireland scrum and win the penalty, that’s excellent work 70 mins.  Carbery dinks a perfect grubber into the in-goal for Conway to touch down. The conversion is added by Carbery.Conway is on for Henshaw, by the way.69 mins. Samoa have the ball for what feels like the first time since 2008, and their first ruck gains them a penalty. They are in possession for about 12 seconds before giving it back to Ireland via a knock on. This is horrible to watch.65 mins. Stander picks and goes from base of scrum and is stopped, he then gets back up while his packmates take another drive in, repeats the pick and go - this time from the ruck - and he’s over with assistance from O’MahoneyCarbery has no problem with the extras63 mins. This game and the Ireland attack is now like Groundhog Day - overrated and not very funny.61 mins. No grounding so no try. There was a late shot by Kane Le’aupepe which will give Ireland another penalty. Ref Berry has a stern word with Samoa about their discipline, it really is getting out of hand with ten penalties in this half so far.Ireland have taken scrum option again.60 mins. Oof! Ireland absolutely splinter the Samoa pack by driving them off their own ball and have another lineout froom the penalty won by that pack effort. You know the drill, it’s caught, it’s driven and they’re over, but there’s a doubt about the grounding. Ref Berry also wants the TMO to look at whether there was a late hit, a knock on, and whether any Ireland players have outstanding parking tickets from 2017. Probably.59 mins. Ireland mix it up a bit and take the scrum this time and it’s very scrappy out the back leading to McGrath shovelling horrible ball behind his backline. Samoa hold them up in the tackle and win the scrum.Beirne is off and replaced by Peter O’Mahoney58 mins.  Ireland catch and drive another lineout deep in Samoan territory, and manfully work it 4 inches around the ruck for many phases, Ioane is infringing at the ruck with stunning regularity and the ref has had enough. Yellow card for the Samoa openside.More subs for Samoa: Piula Faasalele on of Paulo. Michael Alaalatoa is off, replaced by Paul Alo-Emile56 mins.  Ireland are attacking on the Samoa five metre line with a penalty advantage in the bank. They inch forward through the pack like a Roman tortoise formation, but Samoa to their credit are holding their line with great spirit and no little skill and organisation. Ref Berry decides the advantage isn’t coming and calls them back. 53 mins.  Penalty to Ireland after a Ioane neck roll and it’s another attacking lineout. Murray is off and Luke McGrath is in at scrum-half. Mulipola is replaced by Jordan Lay. Fonotia is also on for Ed Fidow48 mins. The Ireland scrum is crumpling the Samoan pack like a broken concertina. The latest penalty given is tapped quickly and Samoa are on the hop as Ireland flood towards the line. Conor Murray throws a lovely miss-one pass to Larmour who is over in the corner after Earls ran a lovely decoy line to hold the defender and make that pass possible.Sexton caresses the ball over from out right. Lovely kick that will be his last action of the game. Joey Carbery is on.47 mins. Furlong is off for Porter, Ray Niuia is on for Seilala Lam45 mins. Ireland do the usual and Samoa are penalised again allowing Sexton to kick to touch and start the whole show again. This time the lineout is taken, worked right through the forwards and Furlong is over in a crowd. Ref Berry thinks it’s no try but has asked the TMO to have a look. There’s nothing on screen to change the call. No try, Ireland scrum five coming and Samoa have yet more defending to do.43 mins. Ireland’s forward carrying remains impressive and they’re punching into the Samoa line, hooker Lam is too keen with his hands on the deck - it’s another penalty to Ireland and another lineout to catch and drive.41 mins. Samoa have a couple of phases and despatch to touch in Ireland’s half.“Hello Lee,” says Tom Callaghan, “It looks like a team with fourteen men are going to beat a full strength team comfortably. Don’t you think that this, combined with the fact that a 14 man English team beat Argentina in 2017,puts some of the carping criticism of England’s recent demolition of a 14 man Pumas team ‘it was only against 14 men’ into perspective?”Considering the past two years in rugby, and I’m including domestic rugby in this, you will see that 14 men get a result relatively frequently and even if they lose it is often not a pasting. The way defences are organised now, losing a man is nothing like the disadvantage it once was. Well, there was quite a lot to unpack in forty minutes there. Yellow card, red card, bonus points, Mulipola’ magnificent hair - it was all going on. Even down to 14, there is no reason Ireland can’t expect the second half to go the same way. Samoa are giving it some, but for me they look a bit fed up with it all now.And that missed conversion from Sexton is the last act of the half.40 mins. From the scrum, it’s flung left on the short side to Sexton looping around from the open side to e over. That’s the bonus point, and barring a Samoan miracle in the second half, that’s the quarter finals.Sexton misses the extras.37 mins.  Ireland are camped on the Samoa line lunging forwards in pursuit of the bonus point try, but the ball ends up unplayable in the ruck. Ireland have a scrum five, and you feel it’s only a matter of time before the men in green are over the line again35 mins.  Samoa fitfully work some possession in their own half before the ball is kicked away down Larmour’s throat. The Islanders kicking game has been utter dreck all half, and it was no better there. They compound this by infringing at the next ruck and Ireland are back in the Samoa 22 via the resulting lineout.32 mins. Ireland go from their own scrum on halfway, they are attackign a man down and they throw the ball away via a forward pass. Ireland still have plenty to win this game and need some sense here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/335f168d0df97758f5e34dcd24f3dfae4644b4cf/302_508_2811_1686/master/2811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=130b352a90f4e55f56069f069c597a55","title":"keeping the show on track at the moulin rouge paris for 130 years","story":"The Moulin Rouge, the French cabaret famous for its high-kicking cancan dancers and flesh-exposing ostrich-feather costumes, this week marks 130 years since it first opened its doors to audiences.

There were reports on Friday of airstrikes and shelling in Ras al-Ayn and Tel Abyad, the Kurdish-held towns that have borne the brunt of the fighting, as Turkish ground troops and their allies sought to close in on both.Thousands of civilians have fled from both towns as well as surrounding villages, and a camp of at least 4,000 displaced Syrians near Ras al-Ayn has been evacuated after Turkish artillery landed nearby, Kurdish administrators said.The UN on Friday estimated that 100,000 people have fled from their homes in north-eastern Syria in the past few days, adding that a growing number had taken refuge in shelters and schools.Turkey’s vice-president said on Friday evening that his country’s troops had advanced five miles into north-eastern Syria.Kurdish activists reported at least one car bomb explosion outside a popular restaurant in the town of Qamishli on Friday afternoon, amid fears that Islamic State might use the fighting to launch its own attacks. A Kurdish media collective, the Rojava Information Centre, said one person was killed and no group has yet claimed responsibility.Tel Abyad’s hospital was closed after most of its staff left, Médecins Sans Frontières said. “Our staff in Tel Abyad witnessed the town, that was once filled with life, become deserted,” said Robert Onus, the group’s emergency manager for Syria.The US defence secretary, Mark Esper, told his Turkish counterpart to halt the offensive or risk “serious consequences for Turkey”, but it is unclear what effect that would have on a government in Ankara that believes it has the backing of the US president.“As part of the call, Secretary Esper strongly encouraged Turkey to discontinue actions in north-eastern Syria in order to increase the possibility that the United States, Turkey and our partners could find a common way to de-escalate the situation before it becomes irreparable,” a Pentagon account of the call said.About 64,000 people have fled Syria since the campaign began, according to the International Rescue Committee aid group. The Kurdish Red Crescent said on Thursday night that 11 civilians had been killed in the fighting, including an 11-year-old boy in Qamishli.Clashes were reported overnight at different spots along the border, from Ain Diwar at the Iraqi frontier, to Kobane, more than 250 miles (400km) to the west.Kurdish officials in al-Hawl camp, where around 400 guards watch over more than 60,000 female members of Isis and their children, claimed there were violent demonstrations on Friday morning which they characterised as a failed escape attempt. Such unrest has been frequent in the camp in recent months.The reports of the fighting, as well as concerns over the fate of about 11,000 detained Isis fighters and their families fuelled criticism of the Turkish offensive in Washington, where the president is under increasing pressure to lay down red lines for Ankara.Trump’s abrupt decision on Sunday to clear US soldiers from the Turkish-Syrian border in effect gave Turkey a green light to attack the US-backed and Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). It has led to withering criticism from his allies in Congress, the evangelical movement and Israel.Trump said on Thursday that he hoped he could mediate between Turkey and the SDF but kept open the possibility of doing “something very, very tough with respect to sanctions and other financial things” against Ankara.A senior US official told the  that certain Turkish actions could trigger sanctions.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, stressed the need to try to end Turkey’s escalating campaign in a phone call with Donald Trump late on Friday, Macron’s office said.“France and the United States, which share common concerns, will coordinate closely in the coming days,” the Elysee Palace said in a statement.The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, has called for an emergency meeting of the coalition of more than 30 countries created to fight Isis. France’s European affairs minister said next week’s EU summit would discuss sanctions on Turkey over its action in Syria.The SDF remained in control of the camps and prisons holding Isis detainees and their families, a US state department official said.Turkish defence officials claim their forces have killed 277 Kurdish militants, a figure that could not be verified. They have confirmed the death of two soldiers, the latest on Friday afternoon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a3f551067811295dbcc23af3859426a48ee9bea/24_0_5164_3100/master/5164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc7f73cd0ae333ca94b5989a78516d08","title":"canada federal election maxime bernier rhino party","story":"Bernier faces competition from the Rhino party’s candidate of the same name – but poking fun can make people more engagedIn the Quebec riding of Beauce, Maxime Bernier is bringing badly needed levity to Canada’s looming federal election.Not the Maxime Bernier who leads the populist rightwing People’s party of Canada most known for its anti-immigration stanceThe other Maxime Bernier – a candidate running for the satirical Rhino party in the same district.Bernier has been accused of intentionally trying to sow seeds of confusion in the riding (as Canada’s electoral districts are known), but he is taking his joke candidacy seriously by promising to focus on local issues close to residents’ hearts and wallets.His campaign slogan? “If you’re not sure, vote for both.”Political satire – whether it’s a joke party or delivered by a late-night television host – has long been considered an engine for apathy and cynicism.However, poking fun at politicians and the power systems around them can actually make people more engaged, says Dr Sophia McClennen, a professor and researcher at Penn State, and the author of several books on the influence of political satire.In the case of the Bernier stunt, she sees the joke as part of the Rhinos’ efforts to protect the nation’s democracy.The Rhino leader, Sébastien Côrriveau, searched long and hard for a Bernier of his own, sending messages to at least 70 people with the name before Facebook blocked him for suspicious activity.In the end, the chosen Bernier was the only one who agreed to run. “He is the best Maxime Bernier I could hope for,” said Côrriveau.“It’s a stupid joke, but it works,” he added. “I’m very, very happy about it, because we have things to say as Rhinoceros. It sometimes sounds stupid, but there’s something hidden under it that’s very intelligent at the same time,” he says.Political satire may be influencing Canadians in the same ways, too, particularly in these increasingly polarized times. Canada’s Rhino party has unsuccessfully run candidates in federal elections off and on since 1963. In the party’s heyday, Pierre Trudeau once called them “the court jesters of the nation” – which the party took as a compliment.The party has run on promises of repealing the law of gravity, reforming retail lottery laws by replacing cash prizes with senate seats and improving the economy by giving all Canadians a minimum of two jobs each.Meanwhile, the CBC’s satirical news program This Hour Has 22 Minutes has been on air for 26 years and, more recently, Canadians have welcomed the acerbic wit of the Beaverton’s news website and TV program.There, Beaverton headlines poke at Canadians’ political cynicism: “Trudeau wondering how long until it’s cool for him to do blackface again” and “Putin impressed Canadian voters don’t need help spreading disinformation”.Cynicism isn’t always a bad thing, says McClennen. In fact, it can rally people behind political issues. She points to protest signs, which today poke fun rather than make serious and direct calls for action.“There’s some energy there, right?” says McClennen. “I’m being critical of the system, but I’m being sassy and sarcastic while I do it. And people are responding to that at a level that we’ve never seen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad283b4877d16c18dc27339406979810cf8a149d/0_41_3968_2380/master/3968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e13f9cfd86dc65439067fe2818b6f42d","title":"typhoon hagibis evacuation japan tokyo braces storm arrival","story":"Tokyo braces for arrival of storm and up to 60cm of rain as flights and trains cancelledMore than 1 million people in Japan have been ordered to leave their homes as Typhoon Hagibis bears down on Tokyo, having already caused power outages, flooding and widespread travel disruption.The storm is 870 miles (1,400km) wide, with winds of 100mph (162kmh) at its centre and gusts of up to 134mph. Hagibis is being compared to a typhoon in 1958 that killed 1,200 people and caused destruction across the Tokyo area and Shizuoka prefecture.The death toll from the latest storm is unlikely to be anywhere near as high due to Japan’s stringent building safety standards and comprehensive disaster warning systems. Emergency alerts accompanied by loud chimes are being sent directly to tens of millions of smartphones in the affected areas.The centre of the storm was expected to hit Tokyo at about 9pm local time (1pm GMT) on Saturday.Three people are missing after a landslide in Gunma and flooding in Shizuoka. More than 60 have been reported injured, including a large number of children.Evacuation orders have been issued to more than 800,000 households across 11 prefectures.More than 210,000 households are without power across the Kanto region and Shizuoka prefecture, and 17,000 Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel have been placed on standby for rescue operations.Storm surges and high waves raised sea levels by 1 metre (3.2ft) along parts of the coastline, while waters in Tokyo bay are up by half a metre, increasing the danger of severe flooding in the centre of the capital.Authorities have said they will release water from Shiroyama dam, south of Tokyo, at 10pm local time to reduce the danger of it bursting. They have urged residents of six nearby cities to take measures to protect themselves as severe flooding is expected due to the discharge of water into an area deluged by torrential rain.By Saturday morning, roofs had been ripped off houses in Chiba prefecture, which is still recovering from a typhoon last month that killed three people, injured more than 40 and left hundreds of thousands of homes without power.A local resident told the public broadcaster, NHK: “When the winds suddenly hit, they blew the roof off my house. The noise was awful. One of my three children was injured but is now in a hospital.”A 50-year-old man died in Chiba after being pulled from a car that had been flipped over by the storm.Adding to the danger of landslides, an earthquake measuring 4 on the Japanese intensity scale, which ranges from 1 to 7, hit Chiba shortly before 6.30pm on Saturday.In addition to the 800,000 people already ordered to move to evacuation shelters, evacuation warnings have been issued to nearly 8 million people. Up to 60cm (24in) of rain is expected in some areas by Sunday morning.All fast trains and most flights in and out of the Kanto region around Tokyo were cancelled by Saturday morning, while England’s Rugby World Cup Rugby game with France was cancelled on Friday. A decision will be taken on Sunday morning as to whether Japan’s game against Scotland can go ahead.Tokyo Disney resort shut down on Saturday for the first time since the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2011.Japan’s meteorological agency issued its highest warning level on Saturday afternoon, urging the more than 45 million residents of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Gunma, Yamanashi and Nagano prefectures to find a secure building or move to higher floors.Tokyo city government has opened an evacuation centre in the Ueno district for tourists stranded by the transport shutdown.Authorities in Sagamihara, south-west of Tokyo, said they may have to release water from the Shiroyama dam, which is in danger of bursting. They have warned residents of the area near the dam to evacuate because large-scale flooding around the Sagami River is likely if they discharge the water."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit a day in the life of an irish border crossing","story":"Ambrose “Bo” McGurgan is checking the tyres on his six-axle lorry at the Applegreen truck stop near Castlebellingham, Co Louth, south of the Irish Border. It is the only check he will undergo before crossing over into Northern Ireland.From the end of this month all that could change with the UK’s exit from the EU on October 31st, the date British prime minister Boris Johnson wants Brexit to happen.McGurgan fears the return of the dreaded customs checks of more than a quarter century ago. He remembers the hard border when 300 or 400 trucks could be parked up for hours awaiting customs clearance.“It will be going back to square one, like in the 70s. It would be a disaster. You could be sitting all day in Dundalk waiting to get cleared,” he tells The .It is 11am on a Monday and the Armagh man has been working for six hours and has already lifted and “tipped” a trailer in Dublin and is heading across the Border for another delivery in Newtownards, Co Down.He is hauling a mixed load of food and industrial goods – sauces and engineering bolts – but requires no paperwork as he drives, unhindered, across an open border between two jurisdictions currently within the EU. A return to the border of the past, that McGurgan waited hours to cross. is very real again.Johnson’s government proposed to the EU last week to replace the contentious backstop guarantee to avoid a hard Irish border with a plan to impose a new customs border on the island of Ireland.The deluge of paperwork, the queues of lorries, the hours-long delays, the potential targeting of customs officers by people upset with the return of a visible border “would be a disaster,” says McGurgan.“People don’t realise how bad it is going to be. We, the older generation, we have done it all. We know how bad it is. There will be customs men shot. There will be. Everybody is fighting for a loaf,” he said.McGurgan’s truck was one of 6,639 goods vehicles to cross the Border on the A1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast last Monday. This is the busiest crossing on the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Traffic counters operated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the agency monitoring the State’s roads, show that on average five goods vehicles crossed this point of the Border every minute on Monday.This is where the impact of the UK leaving without a deal has the potential to cause the most complications.Next to McGurgan’s truck is fellow haulier Brendan McParland, also a veteran Border-crosser. He is heading to Dungannon, Co Tyrone, with a load of peat after dropping plasterboard in Athy, Co Kildare.He usually hauls European steel, landed at Warrenpoint in Co Down, across the Border to Dublin, Kilkenny or Carlow. Normally he can complete two return runs to Dublin in one day from Warrenpoint.“If the Border was to come, you couldn’t guarantee you would even get one load done,” he said, munching on a sandwich in the cab of his lorry.Michael Harbinson is one of several lorry drivers stopped at Applegreen transporting Coca-Cola products from its manufacturing facility in Knockmore Hill outside Belfast to customers in the Republic.He believes an all-island economic unit is the way to avoid a hard Border. Not everyone wants this when it comes to both customs and EU single market rules north and south. The DUP also wants Northern Ireland to be able to vote to opt in to an all-island zone covering EU single market rules for goods every four years.“If the North takes a deal still tied with the South, it is the best of both worlds. It is the DUP who is ruining it. They just stand firm in their stance,” said Harbinson.At the last junction before the southern M1-N1 crosses the Border and turns into the northern A1 there is a fuel service station. It lies between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.Colin Byrne, one of the pump attendants of the junction 20 service station, has no clue how the UK and EU would manage this Border if Britain leaves without a deal.“That’s the six million dollar question. Sure how many back roads are there across the Border. It is not doable, simply not doable,” he said.Johnson has ruled out customs checks at or near the Border but has not specified in his plan where “designated locations” for some required checks might be. Byrne offers a foretaste of how checks might work: “every once in a while,” he says, the Garda and customs check vehicles at the southbound exit 18 off the M1 into Dundalk. “If you saw the mayhem that that causes,” he said.On the bridge over the A1 dual-carriageway next to the Carrickdale Hotel there is a constant drone of noise as an “artic” or smaller “rigid” lorry or a light goods vehicle is always coming or going.This is the north-south White Van Man highway.Between 5am and 7pm last Monday – the busiest period of the day – 5,722 goods vehicles cross the Border. That is one goods vehicle every eight seconds. This traffic is split 50:50 in either direction.“It shows trade is equally balanced going in either direction,” said Séamus Leheny, policy manager of the Freight Transport Association, speaking loudly to be heard over the hum of traffic on the bridge.“It is the artery of trade on the island of Ireland. It connects the two largest cities and to have any type of barrier on this, or ersions, or checks, it would inhabit trade and growth economically on either side of the Border here.”Interrupting the flow of traffic here would have a huge impact, he says lorries would “soon stack up” and could be waiting hours if they had to have paperwork inspected or their load physically inspected.The stakes on finding a fix to the Brexit-Border conundrum are high. Leheny explains that five times as much freight crosses the Irish Border than moves between Northern Ireland and Britain, the North’s biggest market, but it is lower in value because it is mostly ingredients and components, and not completed products.“What we make in Northern Ireland, it is comprised of bits and pieces sourced from every corner of the island of Ireland. If we have a hard border, the existence of those products that we make in Northern Ireland are jeopardised because you would have delays, tariffs and the sanitary controls as well,” he said.In the retail game, this Border crossing is an essential supply chain route for multinationals. Northern Ireland supermarkets are stocked from distribution centres in the Republic, and vice versa. Then there are the food products made with ingredients coming from both north and south of the Border.Aodhán Michael Connolly, director of Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says that a supermarket chicken salad sandwich can have ingredients involving six border movements (north-south and east-west, between the North and Britain), while “the humble cottage pie” can have eight, including a cheese topping produced and processed on different sides of the Border. Each movement involves tariffs so the overall costs could be huge.“That border crossing isn’t just to move goods A to B. It is a lifeline to the supply chain and to those small and medium-sized enterprises right down to the farmers who are in our supply chain,” he said. “If there isn’t frictionless movement across that border, each of those costs will have to go down the supply chain and it is going to make things tougher for the Northern Ireland consumer.”Connolly sees Johnson’s plan as “unworkable” if it is the final deal because a customs border would amount to a hard border, but it is “progress” to open negotiations because it includes an all-island zone for goods.Driving one of his nine trucks across the Border on the A1, Declan Trainor, a cattle and goods haulier, believes the island of Ireland should be “treated as a whole and as one island”.He has no idea how the Border, just a few hundred metres from his office at Carrickcarnan, will look on November 1st, or how he will be able to continue transporting tiles from mainland Europe to Northern Ireland.“It is the unknown. That is the scary part. The Government hasn’t really said how to prepare for it. They are only guessing themselves now so how are you supposed to prepare?” he said. “You don’t know whether it is a dance you are going to or a war. Sure how do you dress for it?”Speaking a few days later, Trainor says Johnson’s “two borders for four years” proposal has left him even more confused. It has also made people who rely on free trade and free movement of goods across the Border “desperate,” he said.“Whatever concern we had, we are more concerned now,” he said.How busy is the M1A1\u0026nbspcrossing?The Border crossing on the M1 motorwayA1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast is the busiest thoroughfare along the 499-kilometre open frontier between the Republic and Northern Ireland.The four-lane crossing between Newry and Dundalk is about five times busier than the next busiest crossing over the Blackwater river between Emyvale, Co Monaghan, and Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, based on traffic figures counted daily by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the State agency that manages the Irish road network.The agency uses a system of counters under the surface of strategically important roads across the country that can differentiate vehicles by wheel axle lengths. This allows the agency to gather data and analyse the volume of traffic and type of vehicles passing on the road for every hour of every day.The counter at Junction 20 on the A1 at Ravensdale between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth, showed that Monday, September 30th – a month before the UK’s scheduled exit from the EU – was a typically busy day for traffic for this major transport route on the island of Ireland.Some 25,301 vehicles crossed the Border over the 24-hour period: 18,175 cars, 6,639 goods vehicles (including the heaviest articulated lorries), 318 buses and 24 motorbikes. That means 17 vehicles crossed the Border on average every minute last Monday. One goods vehicle crossed the Border every 12 seconds.Hauliers, traders and businesses along the Border say any kind of delays stopping traffic on this corridor after Brexit would quickly result in heavy congestion and tailbacks.The busiest times of day are during the morning rush-hour between 8am and 9am, when traffic volumes peaked at 1,935 vehicles, and the late afternoon peak between 4pm and 5pm at 1,897 vehicles.The bulk of the traffic crosses the Border between the hours of 7am and 7pm when 19,625 vehicles were counted last Monday, or on average of 1,635 an hour.The traffic is evenly split between northbound and southbound vehicles. However, more than twice as many goods vehicles head southbound between 5am and 9am – making deliveries to the Republic or transporting goods to Dublin Port in time to make the 8am ferry departures to England out of Dublin Port.This route is a critical artery for goods travelling from Northern Ireland south into the Republic. Some 3,425 goods vehicles crossed the Border heading south into the Republic last Monday.This worked out an average of 143 per hour. In other words, one goods vehicle crossed the Border into the Republic on the main Dublin-Belfast road every 25 seconds last Monday.To put this in a national context, this part of the A1 is almost as busy or busier every day than the main Dublin to Galway M4 road at Kinnegad (26,400 vehicles on average a day), the main Dublin to Cork M7 road at Portlaoise (25,700 vehicles) and than the main Dublin to Wexford M11 road at Arklow (22,800 vehicles).Cross-Border workersTen minutes drive south of the Border, dozens of parked cars – nearly all Northern Irish-registered vehicles – line either side of the road off Junction 17 of the M1 near Dundalk in Co Louth.They belong to Northern Irish tradesmen, mostly from across the Border in south Armagh, who park and car-pool into the Republic for work. They are mostly construction works, plumbers and electricians.“There are thousands of people going to and from work every day, crossing the Border every couple of minutes. There are thousands and thousands of guys down south working and Dublin is most of where the work is,” said Neil Byrne, a plumber from Mullaghbane near Forkhill.The Armagh man usually arrives at around 5.50am to park his car and catch his lift to Dublin. He has worked “all over the south” including in Kildare and Athlone.Byrne says he and his fellow commuters to the Republic are concerned about a crash-out Brexit and the return of a hard border resulting in hours and hours of traffic delays crossing the Border.He doesn’t believe a hard border would work it does not make sense to have one, he says. “It is one small country in my opinion: it doesn’t matter whether you are north or south, Ireland is Ireland and you have to get to your work regardless,” he said.Delays and traffic jams are not his only worry.“If there’s a Border, it has the whole issue of the Troubles starting again because in my own personal opinion it is going to happen the exact same way it did back then: customs guys get attacked, then there is a police presence, then they get attacked and then there is a military presence,” he said. “It doesn’t take much to set it off.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: NIck BradshawA referendum to give voting rights to Irish citizens living outside the State in presidential elections is now unlikely to take place until the new year.The Bill to amend the Constitution was published last month, and a Referendum Commission established, but several Government sources said the referendum campaign would not go ahead while delicate Brexit negotiations were ongoing.The referendum, which would, if passed, allow Irish citizens living abroad to vote in presidential elections from 2025, was originally earmarked for a polling date in May – at the same time as the local and European elections – but was then rescheduled for late October or early November.That would have required the legislation to have been published before the summer recess to ensure a Referendum Commission was established sufficiently in advance of polling day.However, in Cabinet meetings during July, several Ministers expressed reservations about the referendum going ahead in the autumn, arguing that it would ert public attention away from Brexit in the run-up to the October 31st deadline.The referendum is likely to encounter a higher degree of opposition than the recent ones on orce and on blasphemy. Some high-profile figures are expected to oppose allowing citizens who do not live in Ireland the right to vote in elections that might not have a direct impact on them.Complex campaignIn February, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Dáil the campaign could turn out to be be complex and if the Government was to succeed with it, it would need to put in a “good campaign”.The 39th Amendment of the Constitution (Presidential Elections) Bill was published on September 16th by Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney.A fortnight ago the Tánaiste announced the establishment of the Referendum Commission chaired by High Court judge David Barniville.Mr Coveney has said that with the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, that process has been prioritised over choosing a specific date for the referendum.The Bill to amend the Constitution is expected to come before the Dáil during this term. Once passed by parliament and enacted, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will make an order for polling. The referendum must take place 30-90 days after the making of the order.The four by-elections to replace the four former TDs who were elected to the European parliament are scheduled to take place on November 29th. In order for the referendum to take place on that day, the order would need to be made by October 30th.Several sources in Government said on Thursday they thought this highly unlikely and predicted a polling date in spring."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Extreme weather and natural disasters make Japan\u0026#39s civil protection agencies among world\u0026#39s busiestHarry Dunn: Parents appeal for witnesses who saw suspected driver of car which killed their son leave UKComment: Misguided Remainers do not understand European historyExtinction Rebellion protests: Belgian princess \u0026#39arrested in Trafalgar Square\u0026#39Emma Weymouth’s Strictly Diary: ‘From Strictly to soft play in the blink of an eye’French \u0026#39fugitive\u0026#39 arrested over 2011 family massacre is case of mistaken identityTurkish forces enter Syrian border town of Ras al Ain as civilian death toll from offensive against Kurds risesHyde Park bomb suspect John Downey to appear in court charged with murdering two soldiers in 1972Teenager on \u0026#39girly weekend\u0026#39 among four injured in Arndale knife attackComment: Don’t worry, Prime Minister.

Similarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our App Store guidelines barring personal harm.Apple made the decision a day after a Chinese state newspaper wrote a commentary criticising the company for approving the app.National and international debates will outlive us all, and, while important, they do not govern the facts, Cook wrote in his letter.

Thirty five per cent mentioned concerns about tariffs, while the jumpy exchange rate was a deterrent for 33 per cent of respondents.Only 7 per cent of firms said they do not face any obstacles.A number of academic studies have found that uncertainty over future trade policies hampers trade.In the UK, exporters may be struggling to sign new contracts with customers in the EU because it is unclear what, if any, tariffs will apply by the time the goods are delivered.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Richard Ratcliffe, husband of British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe jailed in Tehran since 2016, holds his daughter Gabriella during a news conference in London.

The club will lose their membership at midnight if they don\u0027t find a buyer or prove that they have the means to pay off their debtsThe problem is amplified for customers in countries further afield that have a free trade agreement with the EU, giving Britain preferential access while it is still a member. For goods arriving in those countries by ship, delivery takes even longer, making it harder to sign contracts weeks in advance when it is unclear what tariffs will apply.Pricing has also been difficult, with the pound whipsawing in line with the latest Brexit developments.“Importers and exporters are in limbo, and many are postponing investment decisions, while they await further information,” said Edward Winterton, UK chief executive at Bibby Financial Services.“Many others are focusing resources on ensuring they’re prepared to deal with the potential impacts of a no-deal scenario.”British exports fell sharply in the second quarter to the lowest level in almost three years, according to the latest official data, adjusted for inflation.Although some of the drop was probably caused by a weaker global economy, academic research published in December 2018 also identified a Brexit effect. The researchers found that since the EU referendum, growth in British exports had been much slower than it would have been had the vote never taken place. The trend is “clear and consistent” for exports both to EU and non-EU countries, they wrote.Much of the uncertainty cited by UK exporters has to do with the repeated delays to Brexit, but even once Britain leaves the EU, questions about future trade relationships will remain. For example, the UK will have to negotiate its own trade deals with countries where it currently has one via its EU membership, such as Japan and Canada, and that will take time.The BCC surveyed 1,140 internationally active businesses between 10 and 30 July.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The club will lose their membership at midnight if they don\u0027t find a buyer or prove that they have the means to pay off their debtsThe problem is amplified for customers in countries further afield that have a free trade agreement with the EU, giving Britain preferential access while it is still a member. For goods arriving in those countries by ship, delivery takes even longer, making it harder to sign contracts weeks in advance when it is unclear what tariffs will apply.Pricing has also been difficult, with the pound whipsawing in line with the latest Brexit developments.“Importers and exporters are in limbo, and many are postponing investment decisions, while they await further information,” said Edward Winterton, UK chief executive at Bibby Financial Services.“Many others are focusing resources on ensuring they’re prepared to deal with the potential impacts of a no-deal scenario.”British exports fell sharply in the second quarter to the lowest level in almost three years, according to the latest official data, adjusted for inflation.Although some of the drop was probably caused by a weaker global economy, academic research published in December 2018 also identified a Brexit effect. The researchers found that since the EU referendum, growth in British exports had been much slower than it would have been had the vote never taken place. The trend is “clear and consistent” for exports both to EU and non-EU countries, they wrote.Much of the uncertainty cited by UK exporters has to do with the repeated delays to Brexit, but even once Britain leaves the EU, questions about future trade relationships will remain. For example, the UK will have to negotiate its own trade deals with countries where it currently has one via its EU membership, such as Japan and Canada, and that will take time.The BCC surveyed 1,140 internationally active businesses between 10 and 30 July.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The store stocks more than 100,000 LPs and CDs, and it is the first retailer to offer every film available in\u0026nbsp4K UHD, which amounts to 20,000 Blu-ray and more than\u0026nbsp40,000 DVD titles.The\u0026nbspVault, located close to the city centre, also features a performance space designed for concerts by international and local musicians. Liam Payne will perform at the store’s launch on Friday, followed by James Arthur on Saturday. The Murder Capital and local bands will play over the opening weekend.“I am a firm believer in the potential for British high street retail,” said Doug Putman, owner of HMV.“Retail offers two things a purely digital experience of music simply can’t – the opportunity to experience the biggest acts live in our stores and our ability to offer a platform to new artists in the communities where we operate, as well as opportunities for fans to come together and share their passion for music and film with our dedicated staff.”Created with Sketch.

Six actors – Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale and Ben Whishaw among them – portrayed Dylan at different stages of his career as part of an appropriately freewheelin’ approach to narrative.To convince director Oliver Stone to give him the part of Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer undertook hours of extensive research into his hero, learning 50 songs to mimic his singing voice. When the surviving members of the Doors assembled to hear a recording of Kilmer, none could tell which was the impersonation and which the real Morrison. The Doors was not loved by all but the great Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan were memorable in supporting roles as keyboardist Ray Manzarek and Morrison\u0027s girlfriend Pamela Courson respectively. Gary Oldman was a dead-ringer for the late Sex Pistols guitarist Sid Vicious in director Alex Cox’s appropriately grotty account of the punk star’s pointless death from heroin following the overdose of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb) in New York’s Hotel Chelsea. Bandmate Johnny Rotten was predictably dismissive of the project but understandably annoyed that Joe Strummer of The Clash had been consulted but not him.410 7. Get on Up (2014)Like Rami Malek, Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman faced a seemingly impossible task in portraying soul superstar James Brown, “Mr Dynamite” himself. He acquitted himself well, however, in a film that largely conformed to genre formula but offered strength in depth with Dan Aykroyd, Viola Davis, Lennie James and Octavia Spencer among the supporting cast.510 6. What’s Love Got to Do with It? (1993)Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne were superbly matched as Tina and Ike Turner in Brian Gibson’s unflinching account of their rise to fame and abusive marriage. Adapted from Tina’s memoir I, Tina, the movie follows Ike’s violent attempts to dominate her before a conversion to Buddhism gives the soul star the strength to break free and go it alone.Depicting the rise of game-changing LA rappers NWA in the late 1980s, Straight Outta Compton appeared in 2015 and was a smash hit, making $200m (£153m) at the box office on a $50m (£38m) budget. While F Gary Gray\u0027s film lost its way in its second half, becoming bogged down in contract disputes, overall it did a superb job of capturing the vitality and righteous anger of the album of the same name. O\u0027Shea Jackson Jr\u0027s performance as his own real-life father, Ice Cube, was a revelation.Jamie Foxx was ideally cast as Ray Charles in Taylor Hackford’s telling of the life of the blind soul star, charting his rise from poverty in rural Florida to worldwide acclaim. A sample of Foxx singing “I Got a Woman” provided the unlikely basis for Kanye West’s huge hit “Gold Digger” in 2005.810 3. Walk the Line (2005)James Mangold’s film, in which Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon excelled as Johnny Cash and June Carter, was a highly accomplished period piece and swept up its fair share of awards. Admittedly conventional - containing at least three eureka moments in which the leads are inspired to write their best known songs - this is solid and fair-minded stuff.Marion Cotillard became an international star and was named Best Actress at the Oscars for her incredibly emotional turn as tragic French chanteuse Edith Piaf in Olivier Dahan’s 2007 film. Covering the central events of her life from childhood to middle age, the biopic captured the defiant, uncompromising character of its subject, as expressed by her signature song “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien”.The directorial debut of Anton Corbijn, who had photographed Joy Division in their prime, Control married the British kitchen sink realism of the 1960s with the doom-laden atmosphere of Ingmar Bergman to appropriately eerie effect.

The staff will also be able to advise customers on music technology, ranging from turntables to headphones, sold in store, HMV said. Another offering is a range of 7,000 music-related books and music-inspired fashion and merchandise.In its announcement, HMV cited research showing that every age group in the UK buys more CDs and LPs than the global average.The firm was bought by Mr Putman, owner of Canadian chain Sunrise Records, in February after it collapsed for the second time in December. At the time, it blamed a continued decline in the CD and DVD market, as well as “extremely weak Christmas footfall”. The deal saved almost 1,500 out of 2,200 jobs.The one-time high street stalwart originally went into administration in 2013 amid\u0026nbsprising competition from music streaming services. It was then bought by Hilco, a firm specialising in restructuring.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Warmer feelings than in recent past, more like the old days. I will be meeting with the vice premier today. All would like to see something significant happen!”In London, the globally focused FTSE 100 rose less than other European markets, in part due to the pound’s renewed strength. Many multinational firms earn revenues in other currencies before converting them into sterling, which means their bottom lines are given a foreign exchange boost when the pound is weak.The more domestically focused FTSE 250 soared more than 3 per cent in response to the positive noises emanating from Brussels.A UK government spokesperson and an EU Commission spokesperson both separately described the morning’s meeting as “constructive”, as did Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator.“Brexit is like climbing a mountain,” Mr Barnier said. “We need vigilance, determination and patience.”A European Commission spokesperson said: “The EU and UK have agreed to intensify discussions over the coming days.\u0026nbsp“The EU’s position remains the same: there must be a legally operative solution in the withdrawal agreement that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland, protects the all-island economy and the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement in all its dimensions, and safeguards the integrity of the single market.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing.

In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.Elio goes on to reveal that he’s had few relationships since Oliver and that all were short-lived.“Maybe because I never really let go or lose myself with others,” he tells Michel. “After an instant of passion, I always fall back to being the autonomous me.”The excerpt also reveals that Oliver is now a teacher in the US, his native country, and acknowledges his marriage to a woman. His engagement is a major plot point in\u0026nbspCall Me By Your Name.“We haven’t spoken in ages, and I don’t know that we’re friends, though I’m sure we will always be,” Elio says of Oliver.“He’s always read me extremely well, and I have a feeling that he suspects that if I never write it’s not because I don’t care but because a part of me still does and always will, just as I know he still cares, which is why he too never writes. And knowing this is good enough for me.”Find Me\u0026nbspwill be released on 29 October.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was seen churning out its first ever stars: supermassive objects that are only at the very beginning of their lives.“It’s this little blue smudge, meaning it’s a very small galaxy that contains a lot of super-hot, very massive young stars that formed recently,” says Matthew\u0026nbspBayliss, a research scientist in\u0026nbspMIT’s\u0026nbspKavli\u0026nbspInstitute for Astrophysics and Space Research. “This galaxy is similar to the very first galaxies that formed in the universe … the kind of which no one has ever seen in X-ray in the distant universe before.”Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberScientists now hope they can use the same technique to see other extreme and energetic events so far away that they happened right at the very beginning of the universe.“With this technique, we could, in the future, zoom in on a distant galaxy and age-date different parts of it –\u0026nbspto say, this part has stars that formed 200 million years ago, versus another part that formed 50 million years ago, and pick them apart in a way you cannot otherwise do,” said\u0026nbspBayliss.Nasa releases ‘peculiar’ recordings from surface of MarsThe technique relies on one of the strangest characteristics of such huge galaxy clusters: they are the most massive objects in the universe, so huge and powerful that they distort the very fabric of space-time. As they do, the universe and its light is bent.That can be used something like a magnifying glass, because of a phenomenon known as\u0026nbspgravitational lensing. Using complex processing, scientists can examine the light and use it to see magnified images.Researchers have been able to use this before to study objects at optical wavelengths. But the new research is a breakthrough because they have never before usedit to examine the X-ray band of the\u0026nbspelectromagnetic spectrum, which is so difficult that some thought it might be impossible.“If you’re trying to see an X-ray source behind a cluster, it’s like trying to see a candle next to a really bright light, said\u0026nbspBayliss. “So we knew this was a challenging measurement to make.”To get around that problem, researchers used Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspChandra\u0026nbspX-ray Observatory, one of the most powerful X-ray telescopes in the world. With that, they were able to start looking deeper and deeper into the universe – including at such infant galaxies.“We’re catching this galaxy at a very useful stage, where it’s got these really young stars,”\u0026nbspBayliss\u0026nbspsays. “Every galaxy had to start out in this phase, but we don’t see a lot of these kinds of galaxies in our own\u0026nbspneighborhood. Now we can go back in time, look in the distant universe, find galaxies in this early phase of their life, and start to study how star formation is different there.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Former Google chair\u0026nbspEric Schmidt was questioned in 2014 about Google supporting a climate change-denying pressure group, to which he responded that it was “some sort of mistake”.He told the radio host who questioned him about it that Google “should not be aligned with such people” and said that it wouldn’t happen again.But the company continues to provide financial backing to controversial groups, with a spokesperson telling : “We’re hardly alone among companies that contribute to organisations while strongly disagreeing with them on climate policy.”In September, Google employees joined workers from other tech firms in a mass walkout to support the Global Climate Strike.\u0026nbspIn a blog post at the time, the Google Workers for Action on Climate group highlighted some of the deals and funding that the company was involved with that contradicted its public stance on climate change.Need another reason to support a four day week? Climate change“Google Cloud makes significant revenue licensing infrastructure, machine learning,\u0026nbspand engineering talent to fossil fuel companies, promising to help them extract fuel reserves faster,” the post stated.\u0026nbsp“Also, Google invests in the deadly status quo. In 2018 the company funded 111 members of congress who voted against climate legislation at least 90 per cent of the time.”Ahead of the worker strike, Google announced “the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history”, which included 18 new energy deals that will increase its portfolio of wind and solar agreements by 40 per cent.The workers group hopes Google will go further than this by ending all contracts with fossil fuel companies and eliminating\u0026nbspfunding for climate-denying lobbyists and politicians.“As iniduals, we may feel alone in facing climate change,” the group stated. “But if we act together – if we act now – we can build a better future.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

By sharing details of the phone, the technology giant was attempting to take back the narrative from the leakers, gossips and rumour merchants that fill the pages of the tech press in the build-up to a major product launch.But the limited amount of information imparted only seemed to serve as bait, with publications picking apart each picture\u0026nbspto determine what hardware features to expect. Along with dual-rear cameras, the images also revealed an additional sensor that became noticeable when the contrast of one image was adjusted.Moreover, Google\u0027s revelations didn\u0027t prevent the usual slew of rumours, with Google and its production partners seemingly more leaky than dear Liza\u0027s bucket.The official unveiling of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL will take place on 15 October at an event in New York City, but with little left to announce it will likely be almost entirely ceremonial. For those not keen on sitting through a two hour presentation, The Independent\u0026nbsphas a run down of everything that\u0027s expected to be announced.As with most smartphone makers this year, the main upgrade for Google\u0027s latest device will almost certainly be the camera.Both the front- and rear-facing cameras will see considerable improvements, with an additional 16-megapixel telephoto lens at the back being complimented by complex sensors at the front that will enable the same depth-aware facial recognition that is featured on the latest\u0026nbspiPhones.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google celebrates its 21st birthday on September 27.

A camera block at the back is reminiscent of the iPhone 11\u0027s setup and houses both lenses and sensors.Leaked photos also seem to show that there is no longer a fingerprint reader on the rear of the device, though this may still be featured beneath the screen itself.There will three colours for the Pixel 4: \u0027just black\u0027, \u0027clearly white\u0027 and \u0027oh so orange\u0027.

As always, Google\u0027s own devices were the first to include Android 10 and so there is no doubt it will appear on the two new Pixel 4 phones.One of the most highly-anticipated features of Android 10 is Live Caption, which uses artificial intelligence to automatically transcribe speech from audio or videos playing on the phone.AFPGetty Images)Whilst fundamentally an accessibility feature, allowing deaf and hard-of-hearing users to better consume content, it will also be a perk to anyone hoping to surreptitiously watch videos without disturbing those around them.Google is also reportedly working on a 5G version of the Pixel 4, according to Nikkei Asian Review, which would see the tech giant beat its old foe Apple to releasing a next-generation device.Release date and priceWhile the date of the announcement is already known, it is not clear yet when the phones will actually be released. If past Pixel cycles are anything to go by, pre-orders will open the day of the unveiling, with the release date coming before the end of the month.Last year, the Pixel 3 was revealed on 9 October and released nine days later on 18 October.No amount of leaks have given a certain indication of the exact price of the new phones, though listings discovered by 9to5Google\u0026nbspsuggest the Pixel 4 will cost 820 euros (£727) and the Pixel 4 XL will be 1,127 euros (£999).Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The store stocks more than 100,000 LPs and CDs, and it is the first retailer to offer every film available in\u0026nbsp4K UHD, which amounts to 20,000 Blu-ray and more than\u0026nbsp40,000 DVD titles.The\u0026nbspVault, located close to the city centre, also features a performance space designed for concerts by international and local musicians. Liam Payne will perform at the store’s launch on Friday, followed by James Arthur on Saturday. The Murder Capital and local bands will play over the opening weekend.“I am a firm believer in the potential for British high street retail,” said Doug Putman, owner of HMV.“Retail offers two things a purely digital experience of music simply can’t – the opportunity to experience the biggest acts live in our stores and our ability to offer a platform to new artists in the communities where we operate, as well as opportunities for fans to come together and share their passion for music and film with our dedicated staff.”Created with Sketch.

At the time, it blamed a continued decline in the CD and DVD market, as well as “extremely weak Christmas footfall”.

Warmer feelings than in recent past, more like the old days. I will be meeting with the vice premier today. All would like to see something significant happen!”In London, the globally focused FTSE 100 rose less than other European markets, in part due to the pound’s renewed strength. Many multinational firms earn revenues in other currencies before converting them into sterling, which means their bottom lines are given a foreign exchange boost when the pound is weak.The more domestically focused FTSE 250 soared more than 3 per cent in response to the positive noises emanating from Brussels.A UK government spokesperson and an EU Commission spokesperson both separately described the morning’s meeting as “constructive”, as did Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator.“Brexit is like climbing a mountain,” Mr Barnier said. “We need vigilance, determination and patience.”A European Commission spokesperson said: “The EU and UK have agreed to intensify discussions over the coming days.\u0026nbsp“The EU’s position remains the same: there must be a legally operative solution in the withdrawal agreement that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland, protects the all-island economy and the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement in all its dimensions, and safeguards the integrity of the single market.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Tom Watson, the deputy leader, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, are among those pushing for a referendum to be the priority, but\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn and his team insist an election must come first.Mr Corbyn is expected to face a major rebellion from his MPs if he agrees to Boris Johnson\u0027s plan for an early referendum, without first having guaranteed a Brexit referendum.Prospects of Brexit deal now \u0027promising\u0027, culture secretary saysSir Keir\u0027s claim that another public poll is the only solution will be seen as him siding with other shadow cabinet ministers\u0026nbspwarning that an election before a referendum could lead to Britain crashing out of the EU.Speaking at the Co-operative Party\u0026nbspconference in Glasgow, Sir Keir said: Whatever it takes, we will prevent a no-deal Brexit, but of course we have to recognise, important though that is,\u0026nbsppreventing a no deal Brexit is not an end in itself.It won’t break the deadlock, it\u0026nbspwon’t allow the country to move on. After three and a half long years of failed promises, failed deals and Tory isions, there is only one way out: put it to the people.He continued: We need to ask the public whether they are prepared to leave with the best deal that can be secured, or whether they wouldn’t rather remain in the EU.\u0026nbspThe people must have the final say.\u0026nbspIt is only by asking the people that we can draw a line under this.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That\u0027s the law. No ifs, no buts.And if he doesn\u0027t, we\u0027ll enforce the law - in the courts and in parliament. Whatever it takes, we will prevent a no-deal Brexit.MPs pushing for a fresh referendum are expected to try to secure one next weekend, when parliament will sit on a Saturday for the first time in almost 40 years.Mr Johnson is expected to try to force the Commons to choose between another Brexit delay and any deal that he is able to agree with Brussels, but MPs are likely to try to amend the motion to say that any exit deal must first be approved by the public.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What we’d do is as the tradition, which is have an election for a new leader.”Speaking to Alastair Campbell, in an interview for GQ magazine, he also said: “I think it is the same for my own personal position.”Mr McDonnell also insisted he backed Mr Corbyn’s determination to fight an election before a fresh Brexit referendum is held – but admitted a Final Say referendum could yet come first.Created with Sketch.Brexit and climate protests at Labour party conference: In pictures Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn walks past anti-Brexit campaigner on the second day of the party conference in BrightonA protester holds a sign mocking Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Brexit stance at the party conference in BrightonActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightonDelegates take part in an informal vote on Labour\u0027s Brexitr stance at the party conference in BrightonShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry leads a march in support of a second referendum on BrexitAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonExtinction RebelliActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightononExtinction Rebellion activists march on the Labour conference in BrightonA delegate arrives carrying a briefing from the Labour Representation Committee to the Labour party conference in BrightonProminent anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray protests on Brighton beach during the Labour party conferenceAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonActivists raise a banner calling for the Labour party to restore the original Clause 4 of its constitution, which would pledge the party to nationalising all industryLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn walks past anti-Brexit campaigner on the second day of the party conference in BrightonA protester holds a sign mocking Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Brexit stance at the party conference in BrightonActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightonDelegates take part in an informal vote on Labour\u0027s Brexitr stance at the party conference in BrightonShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry leads a march in support of a second referendum on BrexitAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonExtinction RebelliActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightononExtinction Rebellion activists march on the Labour conference in BrightonA delegate arrives carrying a briefing from the Labour Representation Committee to the Labour party conference in BrightonProminent anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray protests on Brighton beach during the Labour party conferenceAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonActivists raise a banner calling for the Labour party to restore the original Clause 4 of its constitution, which would pledge the party to nationalising all industry“Within parliament itself there is a large number of people who are saying we’d rather have a referendum attached to any deal,” he acknowledged.And he added: “Once we get to the stage of blocking no deal, a general election is on the table.

Pride and Prejudice, then, sees her at the peak of her powers. Through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennet, her sharp-witted protagonist, we witness upper-class Regency England as both a dream and a farce. Not all is as it seems, and society betrays its holloweness when it deems that money should trump love. Despite the fact that Hurston was a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, Their Eyes Were Watching God was largely rejected by her peers. It was during the 1970s and 1980s that her novel was essentially rediscovered, with many contemporary black feminists heralding the genius of her work. The novel focuses on Janie Crawford, a black woman who refuses to give in to bitterness or sorrow, as she navigates three marriages and a life marked by poverty. It’s a story bursting with passion and soulfulness. 325 The Lottery and Other Stories – Shirley Jackson Jackson probed the darkest corners of the American psyche during the 1940s and 1950s, all thanks to her collections of ghost stories, including 1959’s The Haunting of Hill House, which was recently adapted into a Netflix series. With several novels and over 200 short stories for readers to get lost in, there are very few horror writers like her. That’s especially true when it comes to (arguably) her greatest work, 1948’s The Lottery, which traces a small town’s annual tradition to its sinister conclusion. A Pulitzer Prize winner, To Kill a Mockingbird has carved its place in history. Its depiction of racial injustice in the American Deep South was startling frank for the 1960s, in a way that undeniably had a social impact at the time – it became an instant sensation and is now widely taught in American schools. Lee writes about the world’s cruelties with an honesty and compassion that still resonates, with the character of Atticus Finch becoming a enduring model of integrity for the legal profession. Butler was a key figure in sci-fi history, expanding the boundaries of what the genre could achieve and what it could come to represent. First published in 1979, the book still feels as fresh as ever in its first-person account of a young black writer, Dana, who through strange circumstances, finds herself travelling between her own reality and a pre-Civil War Maryland plantation. It’s through this unusual theme that Butler can explore the lasting trauma of America’s history on African-Americans today. Jane Eyre feels, in many ways, thoroughly modern today. Although originally published under the pen name “Currer Bell”, it feels likes a e into the mind of Brontë herself. The story is told through a first-person narrative that feels so psychologically intimate, it’s as if she’s sharing the secrets of her own world with us. We follow Jane through her school years, all the way to her later employment by Mr Rochester, a tortured soul who she falls madly in love with, with many aspects of her journey reflecting elements of Brontë’s own life. 725 Half of a Yellow Sun – Chimamanda Ngozi AdichieAdichie, who was born in Nigeria, is considered one of the most original literary voices of her generation. You can see why this is when reading Half of a Yellow Sun, which depicts the brutality of the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s, as seen through four different perspectives: twin daughters of a wealthy businessman, a British citizen, a professor, and a houseboy. It’s history via an achingly human lens. Smith remains a modern titan of the British literary scene, thanks partially to White Teeth, which is considered one of the most sensational fiction debuts of all time, becoming an immediate bestseller and sweeping up multiple awards. It’s a tale of two men – Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal and Englishman Archie Jones – who become friends after being stationed together during WWII. Their return to London sees the book examine British post-war attitudes to those from formerly colonised countries, although Smith ensures the subject is approached with both heart and a sense of humour. 925 The Hour of the Star - Clarice LispectorLispector was a literary innovator. The Hour of the Star, published posthumously in 1977, invents a narrator named Rodrigo SM, who in turns tells the story of Macabéa, a poor young woman who hails from Alagoas, where Lispector’s family first settled when they immigrated to Brazil. However, the way Rodrigo perceives Macabéa, and reckons with her story, itself creates a dialogue between the two characters, calling into question notions of identity and authorship. One of literature’s sharpest minds and inspiration to the feminist movement in the 1970s, Woolf not only helped pioneer the use of the stream of consciousness as a narrative device, but utilised it to speak openly about sexuality, mental illness, and gender roles. The novel largely follows the inner thoughts of two characters, Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith, one a high-society woman in post-WWI England and the other a veteran suffering from shell shock. 1125 A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories – Flannery O’Connor O’Connor wrote hard stories for a hard world. Her unsentimental, sardonic use of the Southern Gothic style helped weave her own take on the parable, in which the morally weak often face violent, painful punishment for their misdeeds. That said, the door is always open for transformation and spiritual awakening by the story’s conclusion, with her work frequently confronting ideas of morality and ethics through the lens of her own Catholic faith. At times, it seems less like Persepolis is a story. Satrapi’s graphic novel, published in two volumes in 2000 and 2004, feels more like an invitation, as she takes our hand and leads us through her childhood and early adult years, so that we can see through the eyes of a curious, funny, smart young girl who must face the personal repercussions of war and religious extremism in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. It’s the political seen through the personal, but it’s always Satrapi’s own spirit that shines the brightest. Many have now come to consider Shelley’s Frankenstein as the first pure work of science-fiction, with a central narrative driven a character’s exploration of a world beyond what we already know. Not only is it significant for its later influence on culture, but Shelley’s work, initially published anonymously, is astonishing in both its emotional vitality and its philosophical implications. It’s a work where we both feel the anguish of the misunderstood, while also reckoning with the concept of man’s unbridled power. Beloved takes its inspiration from the true story of Margaret Garner, who escaped slavery in Kentucky in 1856 and fled to Ohio, a free state. However, the story itself focuses on a protagonist named Sethe, a former slave, whose home is haunted by a malevolent presence that she believes is her eldest daughter. It’s through this vivid sense of magical realism that Morrison can confront the unfathomable trauma that slavery has inflicted on the African-American collective memory.Although the book has received increased attention thanks to Hulu’s critically acclaimed TV adaptation, it’s all thanks to the fierceness of Atwood’s critical analysis of gender politics. Her 1985 book, which imagines a near-future New England controlled by a totalitarian state, in which women are completely subjugated to men, has only become increasingly relevant – and prescient. Her work provides a continued reminder that it doesn’t take much for our world to slip into complete dystopia. Mary Anne Evans, amongst other concerns, feared that her work, Middlemarch, would be dismissed entirely due to the notion that women’s writing was strictly light and romantic. And so, instead, it was published in eight instalments across 1871 and 1872 under the name George Eliot. The book is far from light set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch, it follows a vast, sweeping narrative that encompasses subjects of religion, idealism, and political reform. Ng writes about American suburbia with an astounding clarity, perhaps partially because she considers the act of writing about one’s hometown as a little like “writing about a relative”, with an attachment that perceives both their greatest attributes and their flaws. Little Fires Everywhere is her second novel to take place in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where she grew up, and focuses on a new arrival to the town, who sense of mystery disrupts its residents’s obsession with structure and rules. Famous for its popularity with teenage girls, Plath’s work speaks to clearly to an adolescent precisely because it makes no attempt to sugar-coat the prospect of the entrance into adulthood. The book’s protagonist, Esther, a young woman attempting to establish herself in New York, feels more like a front for Plath to discuss her own experiences of struggling with mental health, especially in the context of the 1950s, when women’s concerns were so rarely paid attention to. There is an honesty to Esther’s frustration that has been a comfort to many. My Brilliant Friend is only one part of Ferrante’s four-book series, known as the Neapolitan Novels. As the first chapter, it is, de facto, the most well known of the series, but it’s also an invitation to such raw intimacy that readers will be unable to resist delving into the rest. Ferrante serves as a pseudonym, allowing the books to illuminate with candor the friendship between two women, born in Naples in 1944, who try to find peace in a world of violence and misogyny. 2025 The Age of Innocence – Edith Wharton Edith Wharton captures with vigour both the opulence and the suffocating claustrophobia of New York’s Gilded Age, as two future newlyweds – in every other way society’s perfect vision of man and woman – find their union disrupted by the arrival of a cousin shrouded in scandal. The Age of Innocence is a wistful, romantic novel that still succeeds in treating society’s hypocrisy with an acute sense of disdain. Marking a rare mastery of the epistolary novel, The Color Purple focuses on the experiences of black women living in the US South during the 1930s. Although it deals with themes of abuse and violence, the honesty in Walker’s voice is disarming in a way that opens us up to her protagonist’s journey towards self-realisation and personal freedom. It’s no wonder that the book’s continued relevance saw it both adapted into 1985 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, and a Broadway musical. Rebecca remains one the finest examples of Gothic literature, despite the fact that du Maurier wasn’t writing within the confines of some drafty Victorian castle rather, she was examining the world of spirits during the interwar period. In its story of a woman whose whirlwind courtship with a widower turns sour when she becomes haunted by the lingering presence of her husband’s first wife, Rebecca is a book filled with suppressed desires, loss, and a looming sense of threat. 2325 The God of Small Things - Arundhati RoyAs Roy’s debut novel, it’s an extraordinary first outing. Roy contrasts the innocence of childhood, as seen in the book’s protagonists, fraternal twins Rahel and Estha, with the rising political turmoil in Kerala during 1969. It also features a non-sequential approach to narrative, with the novel intricately weaving between the twins’s reunion in 1993 and the lengthy flashback and sidetracks, all painted with a massive sense of scope and imagination. 2425 Murder on the Orient Express - Agatha ChristieWe may know every twist and turn of Christie’s best works by now, but there’s still a frisson to how intricately and confidently she pulls the rug from underneath readers. Murder on the Orient Express still feels like her most enthralling work, as famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot finds himself in the midst of a murder scene, after his train is blocked by the heavy snowfall and a passenger is found dead, making the rest of those on board all instant suspects. 2525 The Tale of Genji – Murasaki ShikibuThe oldest book on this list, this classic of Japanese literature was written by Shikibu, a noblewoman and lady-in-waiting, in the early 11th century. Although the original manuscript no longer exists, what’s been passed down to us now was translated initially into modern Japanese, with English translations being published at a later time. An account of the life Hikaru Genji, the son of the emperor, it’s a masterful work of psychological portraiture, which offers a rare glimpse into the cultural customs of post-classical Japan.125 Pride and Prejudice – Jane AustenAusten remains one of history’s greatest masters in two tricky literary fields: the world of romance and the world of social satire.

It’s a tale of two men – Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal and Englishman Archie Jones – who become friends after being stationed together during WWII. Their return to London sees the book examine British post-war attitudes to those from formerly colonised countries, although Smith ensures the subject is approached with both heart and a sense of humour. 925 The Hour of the Star - Clarice LispectorLispector was a literary innovator. The Hour of the Star, published posthumously in 1977, invents a narrator named Rodrigo SM, who in turns tells the story of Macabéa, a poor young woman who hails from Alagoas, where Lispector’s family first settled when they immigrated to Brazil. However, the way Rodrigo perceives Macabéa, and reckons with her story, itself creates a dialogue between the two characters, calling into question notions of identity and authorship. One of literature’s sharpest minds and inspiration to the feminist movement in the 1970s, Woolf not only helped pioneer the use of the stream of consciousness as a narrative device, but utilised it to speak openly about sexuality, mental illness, and gender roles. The novel largely follows the inner thoughts of two characters, Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith, one a high-society woman in post-WWI England and the other a veteran suffering from shell shock. 1125 A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories – Flannery O’Connor O’Connor wrote hard stories for a hard world. Her unsentimental, sardonic use of the Southern Gothic style helped weave her own take on the parable, in which the morally weak often face violent, painful punishment for their misdeeds. That said, the door is always open for transformation and spiritual awakening by the story’s conclusion, with her work frequently confronting ideas of morality and ethics through the lens of her own Catholic faith. At times, it seems less like Persepolis is a story. Satrapi’s graphic novel, published in two volumes in 2000 and 2004, feels more like an invitation, as she takes our hand and leads us through her childhood and early adult years, so that we can see through the eyes of a curious, funny, smart young girl who must face the personal repercussions of war and religious extremism in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. It’s the political seen through the personal, but it’s always Satrapi’s own spirit that shines the brightest. Many have now come to consider Shelley’s Frankenstein as the first pure work of science-fiction, with a central narrative driven a character’s exploration of a world beyond what we already know. Not only is it significant for its later influence on culture, but Shelley’s work, initially published anonymously, is astonishing in both its emotional vitality and its philosophical implications. It’s a work where we both feel the anguish of the misunderstood, while also reckoning with the concept of man’s unbridled power. Beloved takes its inspiration from the true story of Margaret Garner, who escaped slavery in Kentucky in 1856 and fled to Ohio, a free state. However, the story itself focuses on a protagonist named Sethe, a former slave, whose home is haunted by a malevolent presence that she believes is her eldest daughter. It’s through this vivid sense of magical realism that Morrison can confront the unfathomable trauma that slavery has inflicted on the African-American collective memory.Although the book has received increased attention thanks to Hulu’s critically acclaimed TV adaptation, it’s all thanks to the fierceness of Atwood’s critical analysis of gender politics. Her 1985 book, which imagines a near-future New England controlled by a totalitarian state, in which women are completely subjugated to men, has only become increasingly relevant – and prescient. Her work provides a continued reminder that it doesn’t take much for our world to slip into complete dystopia. Mary Anne Evans, amongst other concerns, feared that her work, Middlemarch, would be dismissed entirely due to the notion that women’s writing was strictly light and romantic. And so, instead, it was published in eight instalments across 1871 and 1872 under the name George Eliot. The book is far from light set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch, it follows a vast, sweeping narrative that encompasses subjects of religion, idealism, and political reform. Ng writes about American suburbia with an astounding clarity, perhaps partially because she considers the act of writing about one’s hometown as a little like “writing about a relative”, with an attachment that perceives both their greatest attributes and their flaws. Little Fires Everywhere is her second novel to take place in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where she grew up, and focuses on a new arrival to the town, who sense of mystery disrupts its residents’s obsession with structure and rules. Famous for its popularity with teenage girls, Plath’s work speaks to clearly to an adolescent precisely because it makes no attempt to sugar-coat the prospect of the entrance into adulthood. The book’s protagonist, Esther, a young woman attempting to establish herself in New York, feels more like a front for Plath to discuss her own experiences of struggling with mental health, especially in the context of the 1950s, when women’s concerns were so rarely paid attention to. There is an honesty to Esther’s frustration that has been a comfort to many. My Brilliant Friend is only one part of Ferrante’s four-book series, known as the Neapolitan Novels. As the first chapter, it is, de facto, the most well known of the series, but it’s also an invitation to such raw intimacy that readers will be unable to resist delving into the rest. Ferrante serves as a pseudonym, allowing the books to illuminate with candor the friendship between two women, born in Naples in 1944, who try to find peace in a world of violence and misogyny. 2025 The Age of Innocence – Edith Wharton Edith Wharton captures with vigour both the opulence and the suffocating claustrophobia of New York’s Gilded Age, as two future newlyweds – in every other way society’s perfect vision of man and woman – find their union disrupted by the arrival of a cousin shrouded in scandal. The Age of Innocence is a wistful, romantic novel that still succeeds in treating society’s hypocrisy with an acute sense of disdain. Marking a rare mastery of the epistolary novel, The Color Purple focuses on the experiences of black women living in the US South during the 1930s. Although it deals with themes of abuse and violence, the honesty in Walker’s voice is disarming in a way that opens us up to her protagonist’s journey towards self-realisation and personal freedom. It’s no wonder that the book’s continued relevance saw it both adapted into 1985 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, and a Broadway musical. Rebecca remains one the finest examples of Gothic literature, despite the fact that du Maurier wasn’t writing within the confines of some drafty Victorian castle rather, she was examining the world of spirits during the interwar period. In its story of a woman whose whirlwind courtship with a widower turns sour when she becomes haunted by the lingering presence of her husband’s first wife, Rebecca is a book filled with suppressed desires, loss, and a looming sense of threat. 2325 The God of Small Things - Arundhati RoyAs Roy’s debut novel, it’s an extraordinary first outing. Roy contrasts the innocence of childhood, as seen in the book’s protagonists, fraternal twins Rahel and Estha, with the rising political turmoil in Kerala during 1969. It also features a non-sequential approach to narrative, with the novel intricately weaving between the twins’s reunion in 1993 and the lengthy flashback and sidetracks, all painted with a massive sense of scope and imagination. 2425 Murder on the Orient Express - Agatha ChristieWe may know every twist and turn of Christie’s best works by now, but there’s still a frisson to how intricately and confidently she pulls the rug from underneath readers. Murder on the Orient Express still feels like her most enthralling work, as famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot finds himself in the midst of a murder scene, after his train is blocked by the heavy snowfall and a passenger is found dead, making the rest of those on board all instant suspects. 2525 The Tale of Genji – Murasaki ShikibuThe oldest book on this list, this classic of Japanese literature was written by Shikibu, a noblewoman and lady-in-waiting, in the early 11th century. Although the original manuscript no longer exists, what’s been passed down to us now was translated initially into modern Japanese, with English translations being published at a later time. An account of the life Hikaru Genji, the son of the emperor, it’s a masterful work of psychological portraiture, which offers a rare glimpse into the cultural customs of post-classical Japan.The manuscript has been described as 21.9cm (8.6in) long and 14.3cm (5.6in) wide.No original version of\u0026nbspThe Tale of Genji\u0026nbspis believed to have survived, but other writers have transcribed the story.The newly uncovered manuscript was transcribed by the Japanese poet\u0026nbspFujiwara no Teika, according to experts. Teika’s transcriptions are believed to be the oldest available versions of the novel.Four other chapters also transcribed by Teika have previously been recovered.Current work on the newly discovered chapter was previously done using manuscripts completed two and a half centuries\u0026nbspfollowing Teika’s era,\u0026nbspJunko Yamamoto, a professor at the\u0026nbspKyoto University of Advanced Science, told the\u0026nbspAsahi Shimbun.“It is very significant that this discovery of the manuscript edited by Teika will be available for researchers,” she told the publication.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

[Evading the law] is not what they were given diplomatic immunity for - it was to enable them to do their job.Here, as -year-old hit-and-run victim Harry Dunns family plead for the mum of two toto the UK, we look at other controversial cases where diplomatic immunity has been claimed...Republic of Georgia diplomat Gueorgui Makharadze claimed diplomatic immunity after causing a five-car pile-up in Washington DC that killed a teenage girl and injured four others.Makharadze, then number two at his countrys embassy in the US capital, ploughed his Ford into a row of vehicles in January , crushing and killing -year-old Joviane Waltrick.Cops said he was drunk and driving at mph at the time.Initially, the law couldnt touch Makharadze due to his diplomatic status. But, with a heavy heart, his home nation decided to waive his immunity so he could face justice in Americas courts.Makharadze was jailed for seven years after admitting involuntary manslaughter and aggravated assault.Even celebrities have claimed diplomatic immunity to try to get out of trouble.Last year, Wimbledon legend Boris Becker did just this when faced with an attempt to sue him - claiming he had legal protection due to his role as a Central African Republicdiplomat .The German former tennis champion was being pursued for further assets after being declared bankrupt in  over money owed to private bank Arbuthnot Latham, the BBC reported.But he cited his recent appointment by the CAR - an impoverished nation - as a sport and culture attache to the EU, claiming it gave him immunity in the bankruptcy proceedings.He later abandoned the defence, for unclear reasons.When Sheikh Walid Juffalis supermodel ex-we made a claim on his £ billion fortune in a high-profile orce battle, he used his diplomatic position with a Caribbean island to try to stop her.The Saudi businessmans former we Christina Estrada - once a Pirelli calendar girl - reportedly demanded more than £ million.She is also said to have wanted £, a year for handbags and £, for cocktail dresses.But her ex-husband claimed in the UKs courts that he had diplomatic immunity - based on his appointment as Saint Lucias permanent representative to the International Maritime Organisation .A judge at the High Court wasnt convinced, though.Mr Justice Hayden ruled Dr Juffalis immunity claim was spurious, that there was no evidence he was a maritime expert, and that hed secured the posting solely to avoid the orce suit.Dr Juffali, , died from lung cancer in  - just weeks after Christina was awarded a £million settlement, but before hed paid her it. Three years on, its unclear whether shes received the sum...In , the -year-old twin sons of Iraqs ambassador to Portugal hit the headlines after they allegedly beat another teen to a pulp in a bar brawl, leaving him in a coma with a fractured skull.Despite -year-old Rubén Cavacos severe injuries, Haider Ali and Ridha Ali were immediately released by Portuguese cops due to diplomatic immunity that covered them as well as their dad.The siblings later left the host nation and Iraq withdrew their father, Saad Mohammed Ali, from Lisbon. The diplomat is said to have reached an out-of-court settlement with Rubéns family.Haider and Ridhas whereabouts are currently unknown - but last year, Portuguese prosecutors charged them with Rubéns attempted murder after Iraq repeatedly refused to lt their immunity.In reality, the pair are unlikely to ever face trial in the country.I think we have expanded immunity way too far. Too many people have immunity, the lawyer tells us.Theres a thriving trade where you can... get a diplomatic passport to avoid liability.These passports, reportedly ranging from hundreds of thousands of pounds to up to £million, allow their holders to claim privileges as diplomatsof small countries and island nations they might never have visited.Ex-International Monetary Fundchief Dominique Strauss-Kahn cried diplomatic immunity in desperation when he was sued by a US hotel maid who claimed he sexually attacked her.Strauss-Kahn, once a French presidential favourite, was accused in  of forcing Nafissatou Diallo to perform oral sex on him and molesting her as she tried to clean his New York City hotel suite.He denied attacking her and prosecutors later dropped all criminal charges against him amid concerns about Ms Diallos credibility. But by then, the maid had already launched a civil suit.Strauss-Kahn tried to claim immunity to dismiss the case - but a judge rejected his attempt, saying he was trying to use it as his own version of a Hail Mary pass, the New York Times reported.The civil case was later settled out of court, for an undisclosed sum.When Sheikh Khalid bin Hamad al-Thanis luxury Ferrari was filmed racing a Porsche through the Hollywood neighbourhood of Beverly Hills, Calornia, he claimed diplomatic immunity.But before police could make the necessary checks, the -year-old sheikh - a member of Qatars ruling family who has been dubbed the patron sheikh of drag racing - fled the US.It was only later, after consulting the US State Department and the Qatari consulate in LA, that officials realised his claim of immunity was , the Independent reported.At the time of the  scandal, Sheikh al-Thani reportedly told officers he wasnt driving either the yellow Ferrari - valued at more than £million - or the Porsche  GT captured in the footage.One diplomat was expelled from Britain after being accused of rape and attempted rape in . The UK had requested that the diplomats immunity be waived, but the foreign state had refused to do so.The Foreign Office said in an online release that it does not tolerate foreign diplomats breaking the law.A Saudi Arabian diplomat accused of holding captive and repeatedly raping two Nepali maids at his luxury home in India was able to flee the country under diplomatic immunity.In a series of horrying claims, the women alleged they were held against their will, denied food, brutally beaten and gang-raped by up to eight men at a time inside the apartment.The pair, who were rescued after a tip-off to police, had worked for the diplomats family in Saudi Arabia after being recruited as domestic servants by human traffickers, according to the .When he was assigned to Delhi, he brought them with him.Despite the womens shocking claims, the diplomat was allowed to leave India without facing prosecution due to his diplomatic privileges, sparking fury in both the country and in Nepal.His own embassy strongly denied the  allegations.Yet one of the women emotionally recalled: They raped us, kept us locked up, did not give us anything to eat... When we tried to run away, we were beaten up.One of the most high-profile cases involving diplomatic immunity in Britain is the death of PC Yvonne Fletcher - who was shot dead outside the Libyan embassy in London aged just .PC Fletcher, of the politan Police, was policing an anti-Gaddafi demonstration when shots were fired from a first-floor embassy window in April . She died in hospital soon after.After an -day siege, during which armed police surrounded the embassy, all Libyan diplomats left the building and were given diplomatic immunity. They were swtly deported.In the wake of the horror, diplomatic links with Libya were brought to an immediate end.Although the Libyan government later accepted general responsibility for the shooting and offered compensation to PC Fletchers family, no one has been convicted over her murder.In one of the most shocking cases of diplomatic immunity, a Burmese diplomat suspected over his wes killing avoided prosecution - because they were in Sri Lanka at the time.Just hours later, Shirley was dead and her body was being cremated in a private Buddhist ceremony.Although Boonwaat was initially arrested over the  horror, he was released after invoking his immunity. He never faced a trial and later ed to Burma, leaving behind an unsolved murder mystery.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a shining beacon. Somehow it made everyone, regardless of age or background, feel special.The menu was fresh and new. We had never even seen torn basil or dough balls. The restaurants were in cool locations. There was one above a recording studio in London’s Bloomsbury.When I was in Blur, we lived off those pizzas for years. I’d order two margherita pizzas at a go because they were so cheap.So it is sad to hear the chain, a British staple since , with  restaurants here and in Ireland, is struggling under a mountain of debt.Some p of every £. margherita it sells goes directly to paying off interest. That’s before salaries and rent costs.Social media is mourning its possible demise. Jokers quip that when it folds, it should be renamed Calzone Express.Yet the chain is far from alone. Jamie’s Italian had to close  restaurants this year and , staff lost their jobs. Strada has shut a third of its venues. Prezzo and Carluccio’s have undergone restructuring.Pizza, as a business model, is brilliant. It has the same ingredients as a cheese and tomato sandwich but you can charge £ for it.Yet times have changed. Services such as Deliveroo mean we can have our pick of restaurant food in the comfort of our own homes.Pizza Express is still somewhere wonderfully classless and unfussy. You can just as happily take a date there as a family.Its three-course meal deal for little ones is brilliant and the staff are always wonderful with picky children. My we and five kids love it . . . and so do my girlfriends. It has expanded its menu, with low-calorie options and vegan meals. Yet it still suffered a fall of nearly eight per cent in earnings over the first half of this year.Part of the problem is that until quite recently there were very few places you would really want to eat on the high street.Now we are overwhelmed with choice in the “casual dining” market, with everything from Japanese to Thai to Mexican, plus a lot more pizza options.What’s more, Pizza Express is owned by a Chinese private equity company, Hony Capital, which has greedily expanded the number of venues since it took over the chain in . There are branches everywhere now.That expansion has slowed, with just two new restaurants opening in the first half of the year. It is taking a more measured approach.I always felt the restaurants had a lot of personality and charm, as well as serving great food at affordable prices — all things that were hard to get in the brand’s heyday.Founder Peter Boizot probably never imagined how much the market would change. He fell in love with Italian food while working as a tutor in Florence before going to Cambridge University. Pizza was unusual here then.Movie director Mario Zampi opened a pizzeria called Pizza Express in Soho’s Wardour Street, central London in . But his film-star friends, including Sophia Loren, turned their noses up at such “peasant food”. Boizot was undeterred.He took over Zampi’s restaurant, including its £, of debt, shipped in Britain’s first pizza oven from Naples and sold his first square pizza slices for two shillings a pop on March , .His first chef was a Sicilian aged  who made the dough in the front room of the restaurant, so customers could see it taking shape.That led to the idea of the chain’s open kitchens, which were revolutionary. It was also responsible for introducing Peroni beer to the UK, an Italian classic.While you would usually have to stand in other pizzerias, Boizot brought in tables and proper metal cutlery.As an art collector, he wanted a stylish concept and hired Italian designer Enzo Apicella to work with him across  restaurants.He called his empire a “necklace of inidual gems” rather than a chain.His favourite pizza was a quattro formaggiwith chopped basil and extra green peppers.Boizot sold the business for £million in  and Hony Capital bought it  years later for £million, racking up debts now estimated to be £.billion.The annual interest is £million, wiping out its profits. Experts say the high street favourite is not in immediate danger, as it has until  to start paying back large chunks of this debt.We have seen what happens to similar chains before, though. If we don’t want to lose this one, action must be taken.Sadly, it is hard to see how our high street can survive without government incentives. Business rates are high and parking is often a nightmare.If you care about a business, the best way to support it is with your custom.And I reckon dinner out with the family is probably better value now, and tastier too, than ever before.

In the last three-and-a-half years, the opposite has ­occurred.It has been the British people — calm, patient, amazingly good-humoured — who have set the example to the foaming fools of our political class. It has been the elite that has been rioting and generally behaving like hooligans.Has there ever been a wilder time in the corridors of power, here and abroad  In the House of Commons we have had sit-ins and choruses of communism’s Red Flag anthem.Middle-class vegan eco-warriors — few of them seemingly poor enough to have to earn a living — have set up tents in Trafalgar Square and Whitehall and brought traffic chaos to working Londoners.Top civil servants and privy councillors have almost come to blows. And a prince of the realm and his new we have thrown a massive wobbly about their Press coverage, mere days after most newspapers had showered them in positive publicity.The clincher for me was Piers Morgan’s rivetingly bizarre ITV interview this week with Boris Johnson’s ex-crumpetJenner Arcuri.Here was a network breakfast TV show quizzing a dimpled dolly-bird in Los Angeles for the best part of an hour, feverishly trying to find outshe had had nookie with our Prime Minister.Up and down the country, families were trying to get some cornflakes into the kids before school, while listening to a blonde with a dirty laugh fight off persistent questions about whether or not she had been “intimate” with the head of our country’s government.Look, I’m no vicar. I don’t really care about politicians’ sex lives, though I happen to think people are happier — and lawmakers more trustworthy —they obey their wedding vows. I also thought Morgan did pretty well in the interview. But it was just such a vivid demonstration of the cartoon-ishness of our current predicament.Cartoon seems the right word because so much of what has been happening in British public le has been farcical and obvious to the point of caricature. Look at the behaviour of the Commons Speaker, John Bercow. His self-conduct in the chair of the Commons has been so maniacally biased, it really does belong to an episode of The Simpsons.Bercow has screamed abuse at MPs who have dared criticise him. He has ripped up centuries of procedural custom to bend the rules to the advantage of his Remain-backing friends. One of his family cars even sported a “Bollocks to Brexit” sticker.If someone tried to chair a parish council in such a blatantly preachy, lecturing way, they would be fired before the first item of business had been completed. Yet Bercow, who will finally quit his role at the end of this month, is going to walk into a six-figure pension for the rest of his le — and he is only .The recent party conferences saw ripe behaviour from our political class. The Liberal Democrats passed a motion vowing to ignore the result of our country’s largest ever public vote. Er, how is that “democratic” At Labour’s conference, the apparent result of a key vote was overturned on the blatant say-so of one of Comrade Corbyn’s key commissars. They didn’t bother to have any votes at the Tory con­ference — they never do — but we did have the spectacle of a parliamentary knight of the shires being kicked out of the premises after an alleged contretemps with a doorkeeper.And you should have seen the amount of booze being put away at those party conferences and at the TUC’s shindig a week earlier. Great lakes of alcohol were gulped down, much of it free. This from the same political class that loves to lecture the rest of us about watching our weekly units.Things are not much better where in our body politic. Top judge Lady Hale has been revelling in her notoriety after she and her fellow Supreme Court judges changed the law and thus made Brexit less likely.Judges once kept themselves away from the media fray. Hale, making jokes at Boris Johnson’s expense and giving quite unnecessary self-promotional interviews, has looked swollen-headed and has done nothing to allay fears the judiciary is as bent as Bercow.The police’s reputation is also in the mire after the mishandling of some plainly absurd sex-abuse allegations. The only other person who believed them was Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who is now bleating about the dangers of a No-Deal Brexit.Why should we believe a single word he says  Talking of the police, why are the Met so timid about stopping the Extinction Rebellion protests in London  You can bet thatthose protestors had been massing in favour of a No-Deal Brexit, they’d have been baton-charged and loaded into the back of a Black Maria. And the public’s response to all this  You have, ladies and gentlemen, been magnicent.You have not rioted. You have not risen up in fury. You have found it hard to stomach, I know, but you have kept your humour. You have stayed loyal to democracy, voting in the European elections we were never meant to have.Opinion polls suggest that Euroscepticism is only growing, with more now wanting a No-Deal Brexit than not.You have, in short, shown the poise and maturity we once expected from our political masters.

Brook DeWalt, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement.The explosion occurred within a few hundred meters of a location outside the Security Mechanism zone and in an area known by the Turks to have U.S. forces present.The Pentagon confirmed that Turkey did not open fire at the US observation post in any way and no US troops were hurt.All precautions were taken prior to opening fire in order to prevent any harm to the U.S. base,” the spokesman added.The confirmation stands in stark contrast with the Turkish Defense Ministrys comments – as they denied its forces had fired on US troops in Syria.Initial reports that US special forces stationed on Mashtenour Hill in the majority-Kurdish city of Kobane had come under fire were confirmed by an Iraqi Kurdish official and a Pentagon official.The Pentagon official also reportedly said the shelling was so heavy that the US personnel considered firing back in self-defence.They could not specy the number of personnel present at the base, but said there were small numbers below company level, meaning somewhere between  and  troops.General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which advises the president on military matters, told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday that Turkey had been told of US positions in Syria.The Turkish military is fully aware - down to explicit grid coordinate detail - of the locations of US forces, Milley said.A Coalition official toldjournalist Josie Ensor: They know we are there, we told them our position.There’s no other target in the area. They’re trying to drive us out.If Turkey can get us to leave so they can siege Kobane, it’s all over.Dan Lamonthe, a reporter for the Washington Post, tweeted: An explosion has occurred near a US position where American troops remain outside Kobane in Syria, a US official said Friday.But he said it was not yet clear what had caused the explosion, writing: It is not clear whether the explosion came from indirect fire, such as artillery or rockets, the official said.Its also not clear who is responsible.He added that an official had confirmed that no-one had been injured in the incident.The Trump administration first ordered American troops to withdraw from northern Syria, where US troops had been supporting Kurdish forces, on Sunday.The move met with international condemnation and widespread opposition on both sides of the US Congress.Concerns have been raised that the move not only represents a betrayal of the Kurds, who have led the ground war against ISIS, but could lead to a resurgence of ISIS, many of whose former soldiers are currently held in jails guarded by Kurdish forces.President Trump has threatened a heavy response to the Turkish operation.Tweeting on Thursday, he wrote: I say hit Turkey very hard financially  with sanctionsthey don’t play by the rules!I am watching closely.He had earlier suggested he would take actionTurkeys operation is not humane - a red line one official said meant ethnic cleansing... indiscriminate artillery, air and other fires directed at civilians.After Turkeys offensive began on Wednesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, usually a staunch ally of the Trump administration, tweeted: Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration.The Norwegian Refugee Council estimates that some , people live within three miles of the border, including , who have already fled Syrias civil war at least once."},{"url":null,"title":"britain youngest landlady pub 17","story":"Queenie Grfiths, , and sister Maisie, , refurbished a rundown shop unit to open MaQueens.Hairdressers by day, they ploughed their savings into the evenings-only venture.Queenie said: “We never thought we’d be capable of owning a bar.

It is provided by the military trust Haig Housing and where the Queen opened  new homes for veterans.She joked with Ken that she was “glad to see” his special birthday card had turned up and “always worried” about whether the cards she ­personally signs arrived on time.After the meeting, Sunderland-born Ken said: “She’s a truly amazing lady.”During an exclusive interview with The Sun, Ken — who turned  this summer — pointed above his head and said: “We were flying as low as that ceiling. I was convinced we would crash and probably end up dead.”In the  Dam Busters raids, officially known as Operation Chastise,  Lancaster crews from  Squadron flew ft above the water under enemy fire.They dropped bouncing bombs to try to destroy three German dams, knocking out Hitler’s munitions ­factories in the Ruhr Valley.But when director Michael Anderson came to make the movie of the ­mission, he decided that flying a plane with a ft wingspan at more than mph and ft from the ground did not look dramatic enough.Ken was then told to fly even lower. On one occasion he skimmed so close to the surface of Derwent Reservoir in the Peak District that the down draft from each of the propellers whipped up waterspouts.Father-of-three Ken said: “I remember walking along the top of Derwent Dam, which was to double up as the Eder Dam, before shooting.“I looked at it and thought, ‘This is bloody dangerous’. If you took your eyes off the ball for one second you would be in the water.”On another occasion, Ken almost crashed his Lancaster into a hillside above Lake Windermere in Cumbria.He recalled: “The director wanted two aeroplanes to fly very low over the water and then climb up the side of a mountain.“As we flew up the mountain, we were getting lower and lower to the ground. There was nothing we could do about it.“We were on maximum power and maximum climb and the ground was coming up fast. We couldn’t climb any more and I thought, ‘This is it’.“How we managed to scrape over the top of that mountain I’ll never know. It was very dodgy but we ­survived. We were flying lower than we had ever flown before, even ­during wartime, and I had arguments with the film company about it.“I kept telling them we were going to be killed, but they insisted.”On many occasions the four ­Lancasters, that were brought back into use after being mothballed at the end of the war, ed to base from filming with tree branches stuck in the undercarriage.Despite their complaints, Ken and his fellow pilots, Flying Officer Dick Lambert and Flight Sergeants Joe Kmiecik and Ted Szuwalski, ­continued to risk their necks.They were not paid danger money and received only their RAF salaries.The Government made money from the pilots because Associated British Films leased the planes from the Air Ministry, which charged the equivalent today of £, per Lancaster per hour of flying.The filmmakers were based at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire and Ken was told by his commander that he was being sent to join the filming.The servicemen, shooting between regular RAF commitments, recreated the flights of the real  Squadron, including dropping bouncing bombs.In , the bombs invented by ­scientist Barnes Wallis that successfully destroyed the Mohne and Eder dams and killed , civilians in Germany, were still a state secret.For the film, Ken dropped replicas made from plywood and plaster of Paris, which looked nothing like the actual bombs. Ken has nothing but admiration for the pilots of the real Dam Busters mission and disagrees with historians trying to rewrite the raid as a “disaster”.He said: “They did the job they were given. It took  weeks to seal up the Mohne Dam and it showed people in Britain that we could strike at the heart of Germany.”The weather in the summer of  was terrible, and with the director wanting fair-weather shots caught by cameras mounted on the planes, Ken and his fellow pilots flew all over Britain to find sunshine.They even went to Holland in ­pursuit of a break in the clouds but flew so low over a pier in Lincolnshire that a fisherman complained.Derek Browne, a young cameraman who flew on the Lancasters for some of the low-level footage, remembered: “I could not resist the temptation to drop a few objects, like toilet rolls, out of the bomb doors over Lake Windermere. The director knew nothing of this until he received a memo from the production office. Apparently, one of the ­displaced crowned heads of Europe was staying in a hotel that received a ‘direct hit’. The king was not amused and I received a bollocking.”Each of the aircraft in the film was painted with dferent squadron code letters on either side of the fuselage, meaning, for example, three Lancasters could play six planes on screen.As the leading pilot on the movie, Ken often flew the Lancaster painted with registration ED AJ-G, used by the leader of the real mission, -year-old Wing Commander Guy Gibson. He was played by D-Day hero Richard Todd, and the actor said: “I think The Dam Busters is the best military film ever made. Michael Anderson shot it in black and white for two reasons. One was that we could use stock shots in black and white of the original bombs being tested.“Also, he thought colour would pretty it too much and I think he was right. Those RAF chaps in the film took a lot of chances and did a wonderful, wonderful job for us.”He said: “They dared and risked so much, so the exploits of the Dam Buster heroes could be immortalised for ever on film.“It is fitting that these men should be mentioned and honoured for ­recreating history.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Gemma Lynch was amazed to find her dress was uncannily similar to the one her pal Gemma Albiston envisioned she would wear at her future wedding back in . The girls and four other school friends were aged  when they put together a time capsule of s memorabilia, diary entries and hand-written notes predicting each othersapos careers. Among them were drawings of wedding dresses they imagined their pals would don for their big days. The gang then buried the capsule at Helsby Hill in Cheshire on February , .    In July, the school friends reunited to dig up the steel cylinder containing their old memories at the site where they hung out as teenagers. Gemma L, now , was stunned to discover she had said yes to the dress  years previously as a picture Gemma A had drawn was eerily accurate to the one she was to get married in the following month. She said: Most of the sketches we did were of big puffy princess dresses with no straps which were popular at the time. But then mine was dferent to all the others. For some reason, my sketch was not like that. It was more of a fitted dress which went straight down.    I was amazed as it was really similar to the type of dress that I had already ordered for my wedding the next month. I just canapost believe as a -year-old girl Gemma A predicted thataposs the type of dress I would end up going to wear  years later. Gemma donned the elegant dress as she married her partner of five years Daniel Astbury, , at a low key ceremony at the Cala Daposor Yacht Club in Majorca on August . The happy couple then had a separate reception last Saturday at the DoubleTree Hilton in Chester, for wider family and friends. Gemma met tree surgeon Daniel online, the couple moving into a home together in Chester alongwith their  month year old daughter, Isla, who was also a flower girl at their special day. The beaming bride said the reception, which included an American Diner themed menu and a harpist welcoming guests to the venue, went off without a hitch. The nursery inspector added: Gemma Albiston didnapost come to the one in Majorca but she came to the one in Chester on Saturday night.    We still get together. We still go to important events like christenings, birthdays and weddings. I think weaposre supposed to be doing something soon. I think Emma, who originally organised the time capsule, is going to try and get us all together again. She said we shouldnapost leave it another  years getting all six of us together. so itaposs in the pipeline for us to have another catch up soon. This summer both Gemmas met up with friends Emma Page, Sian McGreary, Gemma Roughsedge and Katy Wynne to dig up their old time capsule.The women, who had all lost touch over the years, ed in search of their old memories armed with shovels and metal detectors after Emma, who came up with the idea in  while watching Blue Peter, contacted the girls on Facebook .The group were left screaming with joy after they unearthed the steel cylinder before taking it back to Sianaposs parentsapos home to reminisce with a bottle of prosecco.    Gemma L said that digging up the time capsule was a day to remember filled with emotion, love and laughter. She said: We put a lot of things in there, we had photos, predictions of our futures, our favourite snacks and friendship bracelets. We put Twiglets, Wrigleys Extra chewing gum and coins in case they changed over the years. Inside was books that we sprayed with our favourite perfumes, one was called Fuzzy Peach and the other was called Dewbury, I used to wear those perfumes in . There was a couple of magazines we wouldaposve read at the time, like Just Seventeen and posters of boys we fancied like Peter Andre. To find the image of the Mysterious Girl hunk the group had to work out where exactly they planted the capsule. We knew roughly where it was as it was the spot were we would drink, it was around these massive six-foot rocks, Gemma continued.    About half a meter into the ground we hit it with our spades and we all started screaming because we couldnapost believe we found it. After carrying it down the hill, we took it to Sianaposs parents house as they lived close by. We used tools to get it open and eventually we got inside, we then cracked a bottle of fizz open, had some nibbles and reminisced all afternoon. Gemma A, a dog groomer from Kelsall, Cheshire, said: When Gemma opened the letter after we found the time capsule, she immediately said aposwow, this is very very similar to my dress.apos When we were at a wedding reception on Saturday, we saw that it was pretty much the same dress, which was a surprise. It was uncanny.

Grade II listed Blaenblodau Hall in Wales has fallen into disrepair, and is looking for a buyer with plenty of time and cash to restore it to former glory. The new lucky owner will also benefit from . acres of land and basement space to go with the four bedrooms on offer. Thereaposs plenty of work to be done though before Carmarthenshire gets its very own Downton Abbey.John Francis, the estate agent auctioning the property, says that much of the house is too dangerous to even enter to take photos, reports Wales Online. They say that any potential buyer wanting to view before they bid will only be able to see the hallway from the front door. Eryl Jenkins, a branch partner at John Francis, says: We donapost want people to travel a long way expecting to be able to see everything inside, it is restricted viewing only due to its condition. We havenapost been able to go upstairs ourselves and advise that people enter at their own risk. Itaposs definitely a full renovation needed, we believe it hasnapost been lived in for over  years.

In  the charity Save Britainaposs Heritage visited the site and explained how the house was not quite beyond saving: Although it is empty and neglected, Blaenblodau is not in awful condition - yet. It is only a matter of time before it begins to deteriorate no building can cope with a lack of maintenance and the onslaught of encroaching vegetation! The estate agent has made a start on the repairs - John Francis has organised the clearing of the thick undergrowth surrounding the historic home, so that future bidders can at least access the exterior. The gate from the main road is also easily repairable, and the long, tree-lined driveway adds a touch of class to what could be a real gem of the area once rennovated.  The £k figure is just a guide price - the final number will depend on how many people have been enchanted by the house and want to bid for it. Whoever does get their name on the deeds will embark on a long journey to restore the house, but at the end of it will join a list of inhabitants stretching back to the mid-th Century. According to the website britishlistedbuildings, the house was advertised for let in  and first appeared on the ordnance survey map in .  Cadw, the Welsh agency tasked with protecting historic sites, listed the building in  as Grade II for being a aposlargely unaltered late-Georgian style small country houseapos. The listing information states that the house had a simple late-Georgian staircase, six led doors, led shutters and moulded cornices in the hall and principle rooms. The drawing room also had an Adam-style ceiling, which is a neo-classical style of interior design involving intricate detailing on the plasterwork. A restoration of these features would breathe new le into Blaenblodau Hall, which would stand as a brilliant display of Georgian architecture in the local area.

The musician stayed at the home as an infant with his mother, Julia and after her death he would frequently visit the house and his family.    American Kelley Kupfer bought the property by chance after wanting to fulfil a bucket list hope after a severe illness. The retired nurse suffered from a brain tumour a number of years ago which left her blind for nine months and affected her speech. As part of her bucket list, the -year-old went on a guided tour and shortly afterwards was told to meet Jackie Spencer - a Beatles expert in the city. Kelley said: This journey started for me three years ago and illness which took me a very long time to recover from and initially I lost my sight and it took nine months to get my sight back. My speech was much worse and I would sound like a broken record and say the same thing over and over again.    As I was recovering those same things got better and my eyesight came back at that time I said to my husband I don’t knowthis is going to happen again or what the future holds but I would really like to embark on fulfilling my bucket list. So that’s how it all began I wanted to go back to places I had been and always wanted to go back to and wanted to visit places that I hadn’t been or wanted to visit. After a guided tour of Liverpoolaposs top Beatleaposs hotspots, Kelley wondered why nobody had started an AirBnB to let people into the homes. It was then in  the property went on the market for a cool £, with Whitegate’s  Woolton branch  and the -year-old snapped it up. She added: I was flabbergasted no one has jumped on that and opened one [AirBnB] up.    The closest thing to it was the Hard Days Night and it is not a true connection - but donapost get me wrong I stayed there many times. This just came up andI had not been so ill, I would never have gone on my travels I would never have come to Liverpool likely and I would certainly never have entertained the thought of purchasing a property here. But it was because of that and going through something like that, that your whole perception of le changes. I never thought I would ever meet Johnaposs family and they wanted to visit - they hadnapost been here in nearly  years. Now in a huge restoration, Kelley has transformed the Grade II listed building with the help of Jackie and  Lennonaposs family  - cousin, David Birch and sister, Julia Baird.    Despite not being a particular fan of the Beatles , the retired nurse has filled the house with carefully thought memorabilia and some never seen before pictures provided by Lennonaposs family. The furniture also is set in the way The Beatles apos family had it when they lived there with frames and plaques to explain the artacts placed around the home. In the back garden there is also a soundproof recording studio, where bands and artists can record their songs or just want to chill out and play some tunes. The rooms have also been given titles after family members names who lived there. Kelley said: Naively after the purchase had gone through I was sitting in the States and I thought I was going to throw a bit of paint on the walls and gets some new furniture and rent it out and put it on Trip Advisor.

Stacy Jarvis, , said she was furious after finding out her nine-year-old son, Jayden, missed out on a hot lunch because he took his time in the toilet while doing a poo. The Year  pupil, from Hull, was late to the canteen and it had run out of hot food by the time he arrived, and he turned down the tuna sandwich because he doesnapost like the fish. Miss Jarvis had vowed to keep Jayden out of school until she received an apology, but she backed down and sent him back after being warned she would be finedshe kept him at home, HullLive reports. The pregnant mum-of-three has faced cruel comments while being mocked on social media after taking her claims to a local newspaper.  Miss Jarvis had rowed with the head teacher at Thanet Primary School after he was left all day without food following the incident on Thursday. After sending him back to school on Friday, she claimed the school had backed down and assured her it would not happen again. Miss Jarvis has been trolled on social media after the initial story went viral, but she has no regrets about taking her claims public. She said: Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but at the end of the day, heaposs my bain. Heaposs still getting an education, he was not sat at home doing nothing, he was with his nanna doing his history, heaposs got til December to finish it but heaposs done it all.    A lot of people have said your nine-year-old would get bullied because you said he was on the toilet - but is it not natural to have a poo  People have called them fussy eaters, well no, they choose what meals they will have before from the menu. If they don’t like it then I’ll do a pack up. And all these comments about my brows and not one person has offered to microblade them for me. Iaposm one to say it how it is, I don’t stand and scream and shout, it comes out exactly as it is, I said youaposre not feeding my child, and Iaposm not happy, thataposs it. Anyway heaposs gone back to school like nowtaposs happened.  Miss Jarvis said she decided to send Jayden back to school because she didnapost want to face a fine. She said: The education teacher from the school rang me on Thursday to ask why Jayden is not at school but said aposobviously I know why heaposs not at schoolapos. To be honest she is lovely. She said to me I will get a big fine. That’s down to me as a parent to deal with. She said she thinks itaposs in Jaydenaposs best interests to come back into school, so I said aposyes I do think that too, but onlyhe will be fedapos. She agreed with that. I said aposI’ll think about itapos. Miss Jarvis is a stay-at-home mum and her children are entitled to free school meals. When she took Jayden back to school he had a packed lunch with him, a weekly ritual because he does not like the fried fish which is served every Friday. She claims the head teacher called her later to discuss the incident.

Danielle Edwards had squeezed in a trip to Tesco last week before taking her five-month-old son Teddy to hospital. Yet when the -year-old ed home later that night she received a flurry of messages from a customer demanding to know why she was doing her shopping and not sorting the clientaposs nails. The single mum often works six days a week but had turned down the womanaposs request to attend the medical appointment for her son. Enraged by the customeraposs behaviour, Danielle told the client to apossuck a big fat hairy toeapos and blocked them.    In the messages, the unnamed woman said: Hello  You said you had no appointments this week  After Danielle explained that she was fully booked, but could try to fit her in next week, the woman argued that sheaposd spotted her in Tesco and Danielle aposcould [have] done [her] nailsapos because she had apostime to go [to] Tescoapos. As Danielleaposs anger rose, she replied yes thataposs right. I work Mon - Sat. I do need to eat and so do my three children, which [may I] say are five and under. Itaposs pm Iaposve worked all day and not seen my children due to work, so I apologise I was out doing a food shop and not doing your nails.    Still arguing her case, the woman then claimed I just wouldnapost expect to see someone shopping when they said they had ZERO APPOINTMENTS! I found someone  anyway who works actual late night and will work around her clients! This caused Danielle to lose her cool and reply: Fan dabby dozy then baby cakes, now swerve your arse rough out of my DMs and go suck a big fat hairy toe you bone idle idiot!!apos Danielle, from Manchester, later said: She was fuming. Itaposs just pathetic. I was angry at first, but now it makes me laugh. I canapost even go shopping now. Iaposd rather not do her nails - she can go somewhere . Losing someone like this isnapost the end of the world. Sheaposd only been here a couple of times before. Iaposve not heard back from her since then. She blocked me on Instagram now. After cutting her day short for the rare appointment, she then went home to see her two older sons, Jamie, five, and Jack,  months, when she received the pushy message around pm. The enraged customer argued she should aposwork around her clientsapos instead of buying groceries. The hard-working Danielle says she has received abuse before, after refusing to book a clientaposs pedicure when nine months pregnant because she couldnapost bend down far enough. Danielle said: Earlier this year, when I was still pregnant with Teddy, someone told me theyaposd apossit on my sideapos and called me a aposfat b***hapos because I wouldnapost do their toes while I was nine months pregnant.

Coli and later died. Emma Broadhurst was six months pregnant when she flew out to Turkey with friends for a -night stay at the Crystal Sunset Luxury Resort and Spa, east of the city of Antayla, at the start of September. But within days of arriving she fell unwell suffering from chronic diarrhea and became dehydrated and lost weight. Just over  hours later her best friendaposs seven-year-old son, Kailan, also fell ill with diarrhea and on theirto the UK his mum, Emma McComb, fell ill and Kailan was left aposscreaming in agonyapos and projectile vomiting. All three, who shared a room while on holiday, were then diagnosed with salmonella poisoning after stool samples were sent for testing by their local GP, claims Emma.    The friends stayed in the same hotel where two-year-old Allie Birchall and her family holidayed before little Allie was taken ill before passing away having contracted E. coli. All members of her family,  from Wigan, Greater Manchester, suffered from gastric symptoms including stomach cramps and diarrhoea during their -day stay with Jet . Allieaposs condition became so severe she was rushed to hospital after the family ed to the UK. Her parents had to make the heartbreaking decision to switch off her le support on August . Jatinder Paul, a senior associate solicitor and specialist international serious injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, who are representing the Birchall family, said: “As part of our investigations, we are looking into the family’s stay at the Crystal Sunset Luxury Resort and Spa andany issues are identied, we hope that measures will be taken to ensure this does not happen again.” Emma, who was also on holiday with her daughter, Evie, , has only just recovered after three-and-a-half-weeks and a course of antibiotics. Her unborn baby has a condition called Gastroschisis - meaning her intestines are outside her body - and sheaposs going to need to intense operations as soon as sheaposs born.    So when Emma, , fell so unwell on holiday she feared the worst. I got salmonella  days into my holiday and it lasted three-and-a-half weeks. Iaposve never been so poorly! I can honestly say Iaposve never been so Ill from a holiday. What frightened me more was how my baby would cope with it. I knew I was dehydrated but I was more worried about my baby. When I was told it was salmonella my first thought was aposIs this going to damage my baby apos My doctor reassured me that babies are quite resilient and normally will take all the goodness from the mother and that was probably the reason I was feeling so exhausted.  Worryingly, Emma went to the hospital on Monday and was told that her second daughter, who she is expecting in December, isnapost growing properly. Cleaning business owner Emma explained: The had a scan showed that my baby isnapost growing as she should be. Sheaposs a lot smaller than a baby with Gastroschisis should be so I have to go back for weekly scans so the doctors can monitor her. Iaposve lost a lot of weight with the illness and you donapost know whether my sickness has had anything to do with it. She hasnapost grown as much as she should have since the last scan. In pictures I took on holiday I clearly look pregnant but in ones after we got back I donapost look pregnant at all. Thataposs how much weight Iaposve lost. Both families are finally recovering from their salmonella poisoning but were left devastated when they saw the story about the death of two-year-old Alli.  I was traumatised, said Emma, from Richmond, Yorkshire. What a tragedy. Weaposre the lucky ones. I canapost comprehend what the little girlaposs poor family must be going through. I just hope a full investigation is carried out. Emma said she and her best friend, Emma, who was also travelling with her nine-year-old daughter, Ella, had concerns about hygiene at the resort when they arrived.  They had booked the all-inclusive stay through Love Holidays. Emma Broadhurst said: Some mornings we didnapost go down to the restaurant until .am. The buffet was all out from at least .am and I suppose this should have set alarm bells ringing - food standing out for a long time. There was also bird poo on the tables and chairs. Iaposve been to Turkey numerous times over the years and never before been unwell. Emma McComb, , added: One day we were in the pool and a little girl was sick in the drain around the pool. Nobody did anything about it. In the buffet restaurant half the food was cold or lukewarm. People were leaving the lids off the containers. There were also birds flying around and landing on tables and chairs. We had one meal of pasta and chicken and the chicken was cold. After that we stayed away from meat dishes. The kids ate chips and bread buns instead.  One morning we had boiled eggs. Some of them were really, really runny. Overly runny. The hotel toilets started off clean in the morning but at the end of day they were stinking. The smell was absolutely awful. There was water on the floor but you didnapost know what it was. I tried to go back to our room instead of using the public toilets. Airline staff moved pregnant Emma to the front of the plane so she could be near a toilet.  I was crying on the plane home because I just couldnapost stop going to the toilet, said Emma. It was awful. I feared for my baby. I thought something was wrong with her and she was making me poorly.

Abby Andrew, , started to lose her hair when she was just two-years-old, and was diagnosed with alopecia areata.She had a shaved head by the age of three, when her bald spots grew larger than her patches of hair, but as she grew older she became more anxious about hiding her baldness and would refuse to leave the house without a wig. As a child she quit the swimming team and would refuse to go on rollercoasters out of worries about losing her wig. When rumours began at school she wore a wig, she avoided people outside her immediate social circle for fear she would be found out and would only change wigs over the summer holidays to pretend she had grown or changed her hair.    Although she tried to be more open about her alopecia at university, Abby remained nervous about opening up to a partner. When she started dating her first boyfriend in , she even slept in a wig for the first six months of their relationship to avoid him finding out. When I started dating my first boyfriend, I kept it a secret by wearing the same wig every day, she said. I started hanging out with him in March , and I was too scared for him to see me without a wig for sixth months. It usually meant sleeping with my wig onI stayed over at his! However, by that August Abby was tired of keeping it a secret, and decided to share her alopecia with the world.    I had enough of the secret and made a Facebook post announcing that I had alopecia and that was how my boyfriend at the time found out. I was afraid of how heaposd react the next time I saw him, but he told me it was cool that I opened up. For a long time I avoided dating because I knew thatI started dating someone, I would have to open up to them. When my boyfriend saw my Facebook post about my alopecia he really didnapost care, and I realised that being bald didnapost make me aposundateableapos.    I learned that most guys donapost care, and I even tried out dating apps and included pictures of myself in dferent wigs and a picture without a wig. I got plenty of matches, and for most guys it turned out to be a conversation starter. Some guys said it was inspiring to them and they thought it was cool. Having alopecia almost works as a filter to get guys that are going to be shallow about it out of the way. If a guy thinks itaposs weird I have alopecia, I wouldnapost be interested him anyway.

The incident happened near the city of Kobani on Friday night, just days after President Donald Trump said he would pull US soldiers out of the region.The Pentagon claims Turkey was aware that US forces were in the area. US officials are reportedly split over whether the shelling was a mistake or a deliberate attempt to pressure the Americans into leaving the war zone where Turkey is attacking the Kurds.A senior Pentagon official told Newsweek that the US troops considered firing back in self-defence because the Turkish forcesapos shelling was so heavy. The artillery shells hit several hundred metres from the American soldiers and none of the US special ops members were injured, the Pentagon said. The American troops withdrew once the shelling had stopped. Navy Captain Brook DeWalt, a Pentagon spokesman, said: US troops in the vicinity of Kobani came under artillery fire from Turkish positions at approximately pm. The explosion occurred within a few hundred metres of a location outside the Security Mechanism zone and in an area known by the Turks to have US forces present.    Turkeyaposs Defence Ministry denied that its soldiers had opened fire on US or coalition troops in Syria and said its troops were targeting Kurdish fighters who were nearby.

Meanwhile, Turkish forces stepped up their bombardment around a town in north-east Syria on Saturday, the fourth day of an offensive against a Kurdish militia. The United States has ramped up its efforts to persuade Ankara to halt the incursion against the American-backed Kurdish forces, saying Ankara was causing great harm to ties and could face sanctions. Turkey opened its offensive after Trump spoke by phone on Sunday with Turkeyaposs President Tayyip Erdogan and withdrew US troops who had been fighting alongside Kurdish forces. On Friday evening, Erdogan dismissed mounting international criticism of the operation and said Turkey will not stop it, no matter what anyone says. On the frontlines, thick plumes of smoke rose around Syriaaposs Ras al Ain, one of two border towns targeted in the offensive, as Turkish artillery targeted the area on Saturday, said a Reuters reporter across the frontier in the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar.

Promoters have welcomed the move as an opportunity for other producers who have access to a wider range of talent.One large firm, which spoke to the Tele on the condition of anonymity, said: “This is a very big positive#this is about partnership with promoters, and building bridges.”DF Concerts, the firm behind T In The Park and TRNSMT, is staging Bombay Bicycle Club, Bfy Clyro and the Libertines gigs at the Caird Hall before the year is out and previously expressed an interest in Slessor Gardens.The council’s approach to promoters comes after poor sales of tickets for recent shows.The latest gig at Slessor, DunDee s, failed to pull in as many punters as previous acts such as Little Mix, Olly Murs and Steps.There was criticism over scheduling of the s show as it was on the same date as a Madness gig in Montrose, which had been announced months beforehand.And Craig David’s Slessor summer show was moved to the Caird Hall, which has a quarter of the garden’s capacity.LHG claimed the move was due to “unforeseen circumstances”.Concertgoers were also angry after cut-price tickets were offered on discount website Itison just weeks after full-price briefs went on sale.Dundee City Council declined to expand on why it was now approaching other promoters, instead reissuing the same statement it provided to the Tele earlier this year.It said: “There is no long-term agreement or exclusivity agreement in place for Slessor Gardens with any promoters.“The council is continuing to carefully consider the future of the space as a venue.”Meanwhile, LHG, which previously said discussions had been “ongoing” regarding exclusivity, said it would “not be appropriate” to comment on discussions about future shows in Dundee.A spokeswoman said: “We remain committed to working with Dundee City Council and the city’s key stakeholders to realise our joint aspiration in ensuring Dundee remains a culturally vibrant and economically sustainable city.“We firmly believe a series of high quality, safe and appropriate concerts on Slessor Gardens is a key driver to help achieve this.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d970e153c3919.99006593-e1570180930942-940x564.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds new scotland star shankland keen to silence his doubters","story":"Lawrence Shankland wants to surprise the naysayers who questioned his Scotland call-up.Eyebrows were raised when the Dundee United striker was named in Steve Clarke’s squad earlier this week for the upcoming Euro  qualying double header against Russia and San Marino.The -year-old has scored  goals in  games in the Ladbrokes Championship this season but his inclusion has split opinion, with former Scotland striker Kris Boyd claiming that it was a “sad indictment on Scottish football.”However, Shankland is confident that he can prove to be the right man for Scotlandgiven a chance.The former Ayr forward said: “I certainly hope so.

To win the Scottish Mixed Championship is never easy.“They must have played well to win that. I’ve seen them curl inidually, but not as a team.“It depends on how they embrace the event as a team.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions.

It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction.

In Europe and US, this figure is around  per cent compared with  per cent  years ago. Estimates suggest that very soon . billion people, that is a third of the world’s population, will be myopic.Babies# eyes grow rapidly, reaching near-adult size by  years of age. Myopia results when this growth is altered and the eyeball is elongated. This causes the lens’ focus to be shted from the retina to slightly in front of it, resulting in blurred vision. Although vision can be corrected with glasses, contact lenses or surgery, it increases risk of eye diseases # retinalSo what is the cause of the myopia epidemic and how can it be prevented For years, myopia was claimed to be a genetic problem, but to account for the recent dramatic rise there must be additional environmental factors.As this rise coincided with Asian children spending more time studying , and most children, irrespective of nationality, poring over smartphone and computer screens, too much close-up work seemed the obvious answer.Some experts still back this theory, but several large comparative studies on children’s daily routines do not. Instead, the only environmental risk factor uncovered by these studies is lack of time spent outdoors.The results show that children who spent less time outdoors have a greater risk of myopia regardless of time spent studying. The key to protection from myopia seems to be the eye’s exposure to bright light.The scientic reasoning behind this finding is unknown, although animal experiments suggest that a deficiency of light-stimulated chemicals in the retina can block normal eye development.Whatever the fault, prevention is not dficult to devise – send the children outside for more sunlight, more physical activity and overall a more healthy existence.PICS:no_aScienceMattersMyopia"},{"url":null,"title":"september festival fun for soccer kids","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowIt was a busy September for kids from Red Star youths, with teams attending festivals at Haldaneand Lochnell thanks to sponsorship from Ardrishaig Community Trust and Ventient Energy A’Chruach Community Fund.Almost  kids headed off to Alexandria in early September for the popular and competitive Haldane festival playing against new teams from across the West of Scotland.Lochgilphead were represented by teams at , ,  and  age groups with each working hard and testing themselves against some really good teams.

The group, the Mull of Kintyre Milk Supply Cooperative, will fund the purchase through use of a levy from every litre of milk produced, in addition to external funding which is currently being sought.A key element of the funding is the launch of the crowdfunding campaign which seeks to raise £, towards the purchase. The group is encouraging the local community, foodies, suppliers, customers, businesses and anyone with a love of cheese to contribute and further information can be found at www.crowdfunder mokcheddarIn  First Milk, a British farmer-owned dairy co-operative, announced plans to sell Campbeltown Creamery as part of a move away from smaller-scale brands.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box.

A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance.

Batman, Spiderman and Wonder Woman stumble around in a marginalised daze, like elderly relatives invited to a st birthday party, nodding politely to the young whippersnappers while hoping they can sneak away soon, then home for Horlicks and bed.They are much depleted in number.

They evaluate how you should move, then give you a little bit of direction.And what direction did he receive  Shamble with meaning Jason grins: ldquoNone of the advice was very surprising. lsquoMore groaning! More groaning!rsquo That sort of thing.Acting for anime and computer games also has its challenges. Jason is ticked-off when such performances are dismissed with the snooty shrug of a fellow thespianrsquos shoulder.

An assiduous promoter of gender equality, Professor Belch pointed out that despite the wealth of opportunities open to women in medicine, when it comes to the most prestigious areas, such as heart surgery, men are still top dog.ldquoThese are jobs where you may be required to work from six in the morning to  at night, she said, ldquoand most women decided that they prefer to work part-time rather than commit to that. Not that she blames them: ldquoAfter all, we fought for their right to choose.Part-time employment is now the main obstacle in the campaign for women to be on a par with men. When a female doctor first hooks a stethoscope around her neck the future looks,not precisely plain sailing, then navigable.However,at some point she starts a family, or has older relatives to care for, opting to work part-time creates an unsolvable quandary. You could call the shorter working week a womanrsquos wrecking ball, the destroyer of youthful aspirations.Speak to thirtysomething medics, who started out intending to become heroic surgeons and physicians, and you will detect a weariness, and also a resignation to the fact that the conditions in which they are expected to perform are incompatible with any kind of normal le, let alone raising a family.As a result, an essential tier of the health system voluntarily removes itself from the full-time rota. And while hospital-based medicine is undoubtedly at the extreme end of professional expectations, given the prolonged, intense and erratic shts, what goes for medicine is also true of other careers: the advocate who must work into the small hours and over weekends to keep on top of her case load the head teacher who is in the school before breakfast, and once back home works until bedtime the farmer who labours every day of the year the journalist who cannot clock off until the late-breaking story is filed.No wonder people in these occupations wondertheyrsquove been put on the rack, as they are slowly stretched to breaking point. Yet when doctors, and other high-fliers, decide to go part-time, it is a self-inflicted slow puncture. All the training, expertise and experience they have acquired, all the momentum they have gathered, begins to deflate. Friends and family feel secretly disappointed that a seemingly stellar career has lost its stardust. Worse, the part-timer often feels she is in some unfathomable way to blame for not being able to juggle everybodyrsquos expectations, including her own, yet still have a le worth living.By drawing attention to the part-time glass ceiling, Professor Belch highlights how complicated and protracted the business of reaching true equality remains. The effort to increase the number of women entering medical school, which was once seen as the solution to the predominance of males, succeeded years ago. Indeed, that hurdle has been so successfully overcome there are sometimes more girls in class than boys.The problem is that, in the early years of feminism, none of us looked far enough ahead. Lacking imagination, perhaps, or brimming with optimism, we did not give a thought to the lelong path ndash more accurately a tight-rope ndash on which working women must keep their balance. Once aloft, they need to stay upright not merely when they are young and full of energy, but as their lestyles change, their commitments grow, and their attitudes mature.Belchrsquos comments are a long overdue corrective to the notion that the ward ndash or boardroom, laboratory, lecture hall ndash is as welcoming for women as men. In so doing she has also pointed to the unrealistically tough regime in which many professionals are expected to survive. Itrsquos not just women who have a family to raise, or other caring responsibilities, and itrsquos not just women who feel they must clone themselves in order to get through everything the working day ndash and the action-packed weekend ndash demands. Singletons, or those with partners but no children, can still find employersrsquo expectations excessive and debilitating. The dedication and single-eyed focus required to keep on top of the most responsible roles takes a toll on everyone.Doubtless burn-out existed in Edwardian times, it just didnrsquot have a label. Today we have inherited a pitiless culture in which status is calculated by how visibly gruelling your job is. The more punishing your hours and the less time you have at home, the higher your place on the ladder of awe. The employee who can be home shortly after five, and has all evening in which to help their kids with homework or go to the gym, is unlikely to score impressively on the Richter scale of professional achievement. Yet she, or he, might have a really well thought-out le, with their priorities in the right order.The dilemma facing society is not simply how to help part-time women reach the very top but how to recalibrate these Alpha workplaces. The challenge for employers who do not want talented staff to drt off or grow disheartened is to come up with ways to make these all-consuming roles desirable, but also manageable, for a far wider range of iniduals.At the moment, physical and psychological stamina are almost as essential as professional excellence for someone to thrive in such an environment. Yet how many does that automatically exclude  Instead of a place that resembles the trenches, we need to restructure hospitals, banks, or the courts, so that they properly value ambitious and able part-timers. Far from discriminating against their promotion, they should encourage it. A good place to start might be to banish the adjective ldquopart-time, and its belittling connotations, once and for all."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-first-time-brexit-mentioned-coroner-wont-last","story":"Everywhere in Paris, he said, he heard people saying: \"I feel better since the revolution.\"A bare three years later as physician at the Bicetre hospital, an asylum prison on the southern outskirts of Paris, he began his programme of reform by drawing up a list of the causes of insanity among its inmates.The longest column was headed \"Events Connected with the Revolution.\"Here were cases of enthusiasts whose initial joy had turned to delirium. Others were victims ndash men who had seen businesses go to the wall and poverty become their new state.Many had become deranged through fear of requisitions, state witch-hunts and, of course, the ever present, ever sharpened, guillotine.One man was terried and convinced that he had no head ndash it had been chopped by the fierce-some weapon. He searched for and was given, he believed in his insanity, new ones, but never his own.Women, most little more than helpless onlookers, became stressed \"beyond endurance\" by events, becoming \"pusillanimous and often self-tormenting,\" lapsing into \"a dark despondency of the soul alternating with terror or rage.\"Many were traumatised by witnessing both executions and bloody scenes as the Terror raged.Most, though, had been driven to derangement by the dreadful uncertainty and randomness of a morphing society. Livelihood, family and property could be lost ndash destroyed overnight.Emergency state powers, which changed at the whim of the leaders, created paranoia and a state of daily fear. When food, fuel, and medicine ran short, epidemic disease and mass starvation were ever on the horizon ndash armies raped and pillaged and asylums were requisitioned ndash the mad and the sick turfed into the streets.And the inescapable truth at the Terrorrsquos end was, spelled out by Pinelrsquos proteacutegeacute and successor, Jean-Etienne Esquirol: \"By bringing all the passions into play, by giving greater flight to feigned passions and exaggerating hateful passionshellip.political agitation increases the number of madmen.\"For now, facing our own mass upheaval with Brexit, the madmen arenrsquot roaming the streets ndash no, theyrsquore in government or advising. There are no monstrous instruments of torture or death hanging over daily dealings, and, as yet, no deaths as medicines dry up, or starvation as foodstuffs fail.But, by all and increasing accounts, there is a generalised feeling of depression, paranoia, fear of what may or may not come and reports of counselling and mental health services being increasingly accessed.Earlier this month an article published in the London School of Economicsrsquo journal examined the extent of this impact.Researchers looked at a dataset of , people in the UKrsquos Household Survey and found a statistically signicant impact on mental distress since the referendum.And in almost a mirror image of what Esquirol reported, it was found that people who voted to remain in the EU reported heightened mental distress ndash from trouble concentrating to unhappiness, depression and feelings of worthlessness since the vote.Those who voted to leave, meanwhile, reported a lt in le satisfaction following the result. One doesnrsquot know how theyrsquore feeling today.We know from the tremendous efforts of voluntary groups both in the UK and in the British enclaves in Europe, that despair is a word that cannot be used too often.People are in fear of deportation, in fear of having their families split in fear of having no health care and little money to buy insurance or to prove their financial ability to remain.In fear of being ed to countries they no longer know, among strangers, awaiting their turn to access services and the very basics.A local health professional told me she has had pensioners in tears as they ask her what will happen to them.\"What can I tell them \" she asked. \"So, I give them anti-depressants which is no answer at all.\"And, looking through the forums, there are the others who are still tripping in some mythical sunny uplands, wilfully refusing to look at the cruel facts of what is being done in their name.Last month at Gloucestershirersquos Coroners Court, worries over Brexit were recorded on the suicide certicate of a -year-old French national.France Marie-Louise, said her English husband Peter, had lived in the country \"peacefully, respectfully, legally for more than  years.\" But already suffering from depression she became gripped by Brexit fears and agitated over all that was to come.

Ive leapt right in there on the assumption the tale of Eva Bolander and the Shellac Toes is now ubiquitous. Its been dissected on Twitter, chewed over on current affairs TV and made the English press so Im assuming everyone has had a scan of the list of purchases made by Glasgows first citizen using the public purse.Ms Bolander, over two years, spent pound of public money on ious items related to theof her role, which is to represent the city and welcome dignitaries and officials.Spending pound a year from a fund of pound - an amount allowed for the Lord Provost and her bailies - has, to a great many, appeared grotesque at a time when the city is struggling under the weight of a drugs crisis and increased homelessness, while residents are living in poverty and foodbank use is on the rise. Not to mention Glasgow is settling a vast bill for underpaying its female workers.:Calls for Glasgow Lord Provost to resign over controversial pound, expenses claimsThese, though, are systemic problems not fixable by the LP shopping in Primark.Most harrumphed at are the purchases of underwear,  pairs of shoes and Shellac manicures and pedicures. And pound for glasses. Should have gone to Spectaclesavers.The pain is all the greater at being let down by a Swede when were relentlessly lectured about how marvellous are all things Scandinavian.In lieu of a sex scandal, there is nothing more satisfying than an expenses scandal. The public is rightly protective of its coffers, it has a natural suspicion of politicians and we like an opportunity to be outraged. In this instance much has been made of the fact the previous female Lord Provost of Glasgow did not touch her civic allowance.Right, but Sadie Docherty did spend pound, flying business class to Malawi on a trip to see how Glasgowrsquos aid money was being spent.She also flew business class to New York for Tartan Week at a cost of more than pound,. On four trips, the civic purse paid for her husband to accompany her.This is her husband whose salary, as chief executive of Glasgow City Council armrsquos- company City Building, rose from pound, to pound, in one year. Presumably he could afford his own flights.But pointing out that Ms Bolanderrsquos predecessor did not need to use her clothing allowance is a woeful argument. She did not use it because she did not need it. Mrs Docherty was wealthy and she used the public purse to treat herself to luxury travel at a cost far more than pedicures.The chef Tom Kerridge was this week telling the Cheltenham literature festival that pound. is a reasonable sum for fish and chips. Fresh dayboat turbet, he said, with hand cut chips from ldquoincredibly expensive potatoes. ldquoEasily justiable, he called it.:Glasgows Lord Provost Eva Bolander issues apology over expenses claimsOne manrsquos obscenity is another manrsquos fish tea. Ms Bolander spent around pound per pair of shoes, expensive for some but a reasonably priced purchase for others.Her pound hat has been styled as a hat ldquomade by a designer used by supermodel Kate Moss. Itrsquos a hat from William Chambers, a Glasgow-based milliner who has relentlessly worked his way up through the ranks over the past  years. The LP likely believed she was promoting local business.She claimed for items made from Harris Tweed, presumably for occasions promoting Scotland - occasions specically related to her job.Itrsquos hardly a call out for bees to be removed or the cleaning of a moat. Or a duck house.The argument then becomes that the position of Lord Provost should be open only to those who can afford to take on a role that involves the financial outlay of regular black tie dinners and high profile appearances. Or only open to men.Lets face it, this is a uniquely female problem. For men, one dinner suit and youre laughing. The mayor of the Canadian town of Coquitlam, Richard Stewart, wore the same suit for  months to every council meeting and public event to seeanyone noticed. No one noticed. Mr Stewart was attempting to highlight the sexism in the way womenrsquos clothing is scrutinised while menrsquos is not.Famously, Sian Williams, BBC then Channel  presenter, was refused a tax rebate on work clothes by HM Revenue and Customs. She applied for an pound rebate on the annual pound she spends on her appearance because a judge ruled that it was not possible to extrapolate the business and private benefits of the expenditure.Ms Williams quibbled over the issue for years because her job necessitated looking a certain way.The clothing choices of women in the public eye are relentlessly dissected. Theresa Mayrsquos lust for fashion - she told Desert Island Discs her luxury item would be a letime subscription to Vogue - was picked over in an obscene amount of column inches, from the Roland Mouret dress she wore to the Tory party conference to her Amanda Wakeley jacket and Vivienne Westwood trouser suit.Ms Bolanderrsquos pedicure and shoe purchases were scorned and scoffed at. Yet donrsquot we remember the Sun making a front page splash out of a close up of Theresa Mayrsquos leopard print pumps Its frustrating to live in a society where a high profile and successful woman feels pressure to have her toes painted while on official business.Yet you cant argue with her press photographers take images so high res as to be able to see a persons pores. Stories are made from famous women having slight underarm hair or a few grey strands. There is intense pressure on women, particularly in the public eye, to conform to certain standards and those standards cost money.Eva Bolander represents the city of Glasgow. She is entitled to spend a certain amount of money in the fulfilment of that role and that is what she has done. Either you agree that Lord Provosts should be provided with civic allowances or you dont.Andyou dont then the call should be for the spending allowance to be cut, not for a woman to be scalped because youre aggrieved her haircut costs too much."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9224300.jpg?type=article-full","title":"snp-accuse-bbc-selective-storytelling-political-representation","story":"In a statement, Keith Brown, the SNPs depute leader accusedthe corporation of selective storytellingIt comes after theLib Dems had more than double the amount of SNP appearances on the broadcasterrsquos main political shows throughout September.Data reported in our sister paper The National, showed the Lib Dems had  guests slots to the SNPs  with the Lib Dem conference being part of the reason for more guest slots.

If anything, it could have the opposite effect with MSPs waiting hours on end to be called to deliver their party-approved soundbites.If we are to accept that Holyroodrsquos ever-increasing powers have created extra pressure on Parliament, a far more sensible suggestion would be to increase the staffing allowance for MSPs ndash not the number of politicians.MSPsrsquo staffers are the unsung heroes who pick up the phone to constituents and respond to the emails coming in ndash whatrsquos called the casework.They take on the casework and they complete it on the MSPrsquos behalf.Itrsquos the staff members who are the gatekeepers to MSPs, dealing with the lobbyists, charities and organisations who want to make their case.They run the diary, they often write the speeches, they operate the office budget.Yet the steering group report makes no reference to MSPsrsquo employees.It may not be particularly popular with the public either, butthere is to be any additional taxpayersrsquo money spent on Holyrood, this is where extra capacity could actually help the voters of Scotland.The group did, however, come to the right conclusion about the state of Holyroodrsquos committees.ldquoOne of our biggest disappointments is that the Parliamentrsquos committees have not emerged as a power in the land in the way that we had hoped, they concluded.Itrsquos a disappointment shared by every political journalist who has endured a stale Holyrood committee meeting.If staffers are the unsung heroes of the MSP offices, the journalists at the Press Association who file reports from several committees every week are their equivalent for the media lobby in Parliament.With a few notable exceptions, Holyroodrsquos committees are generally tribal affairs where MSPs always put their parties first.The worst examples are when ministers are called to give evidence, and SNP backbenchers come along not to hold them to account, but to stroke their egos.Does the minister agree they are doing a wonderful job, we should all be very grateful to have such a wonderful minister, and anything that has gone wrong under the ministerrsquos watch is all Westminsterrsquos fault lsquoJournalesersquo language dictates that these committees should be described as powerful, when a better description would be woeful.So the steering group is right to challenge the current set-up, and to call for elected conveners to be considered.This would, the members argue, \"strengthen the independence of committees and give a clearer mandate for holding the government to account on behalf of the Parliament as a whole\".Itrsquos baffling that this hasnrsquot already happened at Holyrood.The only explanation can be that Westminster does it, so therefore it must be bad.Unfortunately, while Holyrood works hard to do away with the many archaic and bewildering practices at Westminster, it simultaneously fails to recognise what it does right.Elected committee chairmen and women were introduced in the House of Commons in .While you can still find cannon fodder on the committee seats, Select Committee chairs tend to be ex-ministers or less-partisan backbenchers, prepared to hold the Government to account and use increased media attention to their advantage.They receive a larger salary, but this would surely be a better use of public funds that simply increasing the number of MSPs.The Public Accounts Committee is a particularly powerful watchdog committee, always chaired by a leading opposition MP.According to the Democratic Audit organisation, the reports from the independent National Audit Office it deals with come from the second most powerful supreme audit institution in the liberal democratic world, after the US.So there is still a great deal that Holyrood could learn from the mother of Parliaments,  years after it was created to do things dferently.But so, too, of course, could Westminster learn from the Scottish Parliament.It is increasingly hard to defend the lobby voting system in the Commons, and the amount of time it takes for MPs to cast a vote.Supporters argue that it is valuable time for backbenchers to collar ministers or speak to one another when they are all crammed into one room.But when sittings repeatedly drag on late into the night, itrsquos clear that the status quo cannot continue.Itrsquos not good for MPsrsquo physical or mental wellbeing and itrsquos not good for democracy.If inaccessibility of government ministers is a problem, thatrsquos the reform thatrsquos needed ndash not sustaining a centuries-old lobby system.Queuing to have your name ticked off is ridiculous when compared with decision time at Holyrood, where there is electronic voting and no loss of transparency of accountability.Yes, sometimes a distracted MSP might press the wrong button, but SNP MP Angus MacNeil once locked himself in the toilet after finding himself in the wrong voting lobby.Both parliaments can ndash and should - learn from each other.Both have systems and set-ups that work, and those that donrsquot work.Party political tribalism in the Scottish Parliament is unlikely to disappear any time soon, but tribalism between Holyrood and Westminster cannot be allowed to stand in the way of making both parliaments deliver more for voters."},{"url":null,"title":"greens-aim-high-next-election-order-lower-emissions","story":"Opening a two-day conference in Inverness, co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater will claim the party can win two list seats in each of the eight electoral regions in .The Greens currently have six MSPs and their previous best is seven.The co-leaders will argue the party has already forced reforms to income tax, stopped council cuts, helped ban smacking and introduced local taxes.But it says more MSPs are needed to help drive through the short-term measures needed to make drastic cuts to emissions and achieve a zero-carbon economy.Ms Slater will say: ldquoOnly the Greens understand the climate emergency, know what needs to be done, and are determined enough to deliver transformative change.ldquoEvery one of the  candidates we announce today can be elected in . Just imagine the hope this could give us. The power to take the action needed to save the planet and build a new Scotland. Our time is now.ldquoIn , we can win. We can lead the way with a vision for a Green and Independent Scotland.The party will call for a doubling of Scotlandrsquos forest cover to bring it in line with the EU average to create thousands of rural jobs as part of a Green New Deal.Around  per cent of Scotland is forested the EU average is %.Recent research found forestry can provide a job per every  hectares, compared to one for every  ha for agriculture and one for every  ha for grouse shooting.After visiting the Scottish School of Forestry near Inverness yesterday, MSP Ross Greer said: ldquoForestry careers require a level of expertise that is not yet being met across the country. ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos current rate of reforestation would meet the EU average in  years, but even at that snailrsquos pace, it will need more investment to meet the skills gaps in the sector.The conference will also debate the future of social security at conference, with a proposal to let immigrants access universal credit and other reforms intended to create a fairer systemHinting at higher taxes on the better-off, MSP Alison Johnstone said: ldquoThe UK Government has taken a sledgehammer to social security provision over recent years leaving the most vulnerable people in our communities in dire straight.ldquoIt is vital the dignity and respect is at the heart of our social security system. I am extremely proud to have brought forward signicant changes to make our system work better, including ending unnecessary face-to-face assessments for people claiming devolved disability benefits.ldquoMore fundamentally Scotland needs a social security system that meets the needs of everyone in our society. A universal basic income would ensure that absolutely everyone received an allowance to meet their basic needs.ldquoItrsquos clear we can go further in this regard, ensuring a fairer taxation regime, funding a fairer social security system."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-declaration-independence-everything-brexiters-despise","story":"It wonrsquot, of course. Already, Unionist and Conservative lips are curling in disdain at a statement they portray as woolly, inconsequential and dreamily optimistic. Any document containing words such as \"non-aggression\", \"transparency\", \"scrutiny\" and \"kindness\" was always going to be treated with the caution of a bomb-disposal unit. The Labour Party in Scotland, meanwhile, will simply get Gordon Brown to describe it as nasty, isive and a risk to old peoplersquos pensions.At other times in Scotlandrsquos history, and in other circumstances, perhaps this document would have left itself open to charges of conceit: the entitled caprice of a comfortable elite who can afford to indulge each other at their dinner- parties and in their salons. It doesnrsquot exactly fuel the fires of revolution or rage against injustice. Its tone is that of a retired person asking why his discount voucher doesnrsquot apply during peak periods.The following passage is instructive: ldquoOwnership of land, property and natural resources should be subject to open and democratic scrutiny. Well, quite. As a statement of intent itrsquos about as radical as a halloumi and bean crepe. I would have had something like this: ldquoOwnership of land, property and natural resources should be reviewed urgently and then determined by a system of local peoplersquos tribunals prior to re-distribution.Herersquos another one: ldquoWe affirm the values of care, kindness, neighbourliness and generosity of spirit in all our dealings. Irsquom sure that line is Emilyrsquos from one of her daily chats with Bagpuss on childrenrsquos television many years ago. Shouldnrsquot there have been some kind of an ldquoor hellip at the end of it I think, though, we should resist the temptation to mock. We should suspend our cynicism. At this time in the history of these islands, wersquove never been in more urgent need of a manesto for decency which, essentially, is what this declaration for independence is all about. Very little of it is new or unexpected. If you are inclined to be liberal in your instincts while respecting the other personrsquos point of view yoursquoll agree with most of this, evenyou donrsquot subscribe to its over-arching conclusion, that these aspirations are best guaranteed in an independent Scotland.The wary optimism now being expressed by both sides as midnight approaches on our departure from the European Union will not repair the damage thatrsquos been done to Britain over the course of the last three years. All debate about the economic cost of Brexit and the threat to jobs, fuel and medicine ceased a long time ago. The disputed weight of consequences and the potential impact on daily lives came to be replaced by something more visceral and elemental that adhered to the rules of a pitbull fight. Thus it became a raw struggle for the soul of England and England alone.In this, notions of ethnic superiority began to hold sway fed by a steady stream of xenophobia from Englandrsquos red-top army. The High Tories, the architects of this extreme Brexit, encouraged these ideas and beseeched their Etonian chums in Englandrsquos great media houses to fan the flames. Only by appealing to this hidden fury, bottled up for decades after the end of the Second World War, could they hope to camouflage their ultimate aim of sweeping away all possible obstacles to accumulating wealth with the merest measure of scrutiny. Brexit was their once-in-a-letime opportunity to make laws unto themselves. Trling considerations like ldquocare, kindness, neighbourliness and generosity of spirit were regarded as collateral damage.Those Dorian Grays among the Tories who lately began to recoil at this image of what their party had been all this time seemed genuinely shocked. They expressed sorrow that \"decent\" Toryism and \"gentle\" Toryism and \"ethical\" Toryism had been abducted by the Cummings Johnson Gove axis. Perhaps they also believe in vegan alligators. Extreme Brexit and its beliefs are merely the quintessence of what Conservatism has ever been about: preserving power by all means necessary for as few people as possible. How did they think this was all going to end The Declaration for Independence produced in Scotland represents all that is regarded as anathema to the Brexiteers and Little England fanaticism. Inexact, hopefully optimistic and grandiose this document may have been but it was also a rebuke to the hollowed-out version of humanity that has fuelled Brexit.The Declaration for Independence also carried a subliminal message to the SNP as its members and activists gather in Aberdeen tomorrow for their annual conference. The party has yet to espouse a coherent and consistent position on Brexit, a truth that was brutally exposed by a wide-ranging poll carried by the Wings Over Scotland website, which remains the wider Yes movementrsquos most influential weather-vane. The way in which the SNPrsquos increasingly exclusive and controlling central office has sought to ensure that there will be no dissenting voices about this in Aberdeen is becoming a major problem.Another concern is widespread discontent about the stitch-ups masquerading as a candidate selection process for representation at Westminster. In at least one instance this led to a threat of legal action. There are a favoured few near the top of the SNP who are acting in the best traditions of the hard Brexiters whose methods they purport to despise.The party would be well-advised also to consider closely that passage about care, kindness and generosity of spirit in the Declaration. Little of those have been in evidence in the poison being directed at some of its most able and committed politicians like Joanna Cherry, Joan McAlpine and Chris McEleny because of their personal beliefs. Much of this can be traced to the door of iniduals with very close connections to a handful of senior figures in the SNP. Itrsquos now time for Nicola Sturgeon to show leadership here and to stop this insidious faction contaminating the party further. She could start by taking them through the Declaration for Independence line by line."},{"url":null,"title":"calmac-cries-foul-private-ferry-deal-leading-contract-freezing","story":"CalMac Ferries last month failed to convince ministers to let it take over public service sea routes from the mainland to Orkney and Shetland.The government-owned firm lost out to what it claims was a more expensive bid from private company Serco.Now CalMac has started formally quizzing quango Transport Scotland over why it lost out to Serco. Its move means the contract, announced last month, is now in what is called ldquoextended standstill.: Lasers find a thousand new archaeological sites on ArranA spokesperson for David MacBrayne Ltd, CalMacrsquos state-owned parent company, said: ldquoHaving won the tender for the Northern Isles ferry services on price, we are in dialogue with Transport Scotland and analysing the detailed information we requested from them about their scoring process.ldquoAs we are still in what is now an extended standstill period, we cannot comment further.Islands minister Paul Wheelhouse announced Serco was the preferred bidder for the contract with news of a three-year fares freeze for island passengers and  per cent discounts for cabins on long routes from Aberdeen to the islands.The franchise, called Northlink, also includes shorter hops from Scrabster in Caithness to Stromness in Orkney. The route has one of Scotlandrsquos few non-subsidised rivals, from near John OrsquoGroats to St Margaretrsquos Hope.Serco Group Chief Executive Rupert Soames welcomed the announcement, saying: ldquoWe are very proud of our track record over the past seven years, during which time we have improved almost every aspect of the leline service for the communities and businesses of the Northern Isles.Serco ferries have not faced the same problems CalMac has dealt with in recent years.Decades of under-investment and climate change have left the state operator with ships and ports that are often unable to offer or complete services.Most recently, there was disruption on CalMacrsquos flagship route from Ayrshire to Arran earlier this month.There was always expected to be a ldquostandstill period before the Northlink contract, which runs for eight years, was signed. But it was supposed to be only  days.Unions and the Labour Party had lobbied heavily for public-sector CalMac to get the contract. This would have brought all of Scotlandrsquos subsidised ferries under one state operator.After the announcement of the preferred bidder was made, Mr Wheelhouse faced questions in Holyrood about the decision.Scottish Greensrsquo Highlands and Islands MSP John Finnie quizzed him on why and how Serco was chosen.Mr Wheelhouse responded: ldquoSerco Ltd was awarded the status of preferred bidder on the basis of an assessment ratio of % price and % quality, as was set out in the tender documents and made clear to all bidders when the invitation to tender was issued.ldquoSerco was assessed as providing the most economically advantageous tender under the terms of the competition, with a tender that was evaluated under the tender criteria to provide high-quality ferry services and value for money for the taxpayer.CalMac told The Herald its bid was cheaper than Sercorsquos. This suggests Sercorsquos quality of service must have been judged much better than CalMacrsquos since price is scored twice as highly as quality.A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: ldquoUntil the new contract for the Northern Isles ferry services is awarded this is a live procurement [and] there is a limit on what can be said at this time. However, more detailed information will be provided in due course and when it is more appropriate to do so.: Scientists discover twenty previously unknown moons orbiting SaturnldquoWe continue to engage with the European Commission regarding the ongoing complaint from Pentland Ferries following receipt of further approaches from the Commission.ldquoThis will not have an impact on the Scottish Government commitment, from January , to introduce a % discount on cabin fares on the Aberdeen-Kirkwall-Lerwick routes, as well as a three-year fares freeze for passengers, non-commercial vehicles and cabins on these routes.Mr Finnie challenged Mr Wheelhouse on the decision. He said: ldquoLast year, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Economy and Fair Work signed a commitment to application of the fair work principles across the Scottish Government and associated bodies. RMT is in the process of taking strike action against Serco, as the operator of the Caledonian sleeper train, for reneging on pledges to address serious concerns about staff safety.ldquoCan the minister honestly tell Parliament that Serco is living up to the fair work principles  If not, perhaps he can explain why the fair work convention was considered to be suitable for civil servants but not for people who work in the transport sector under Serco "},{"url":null,"title":"saving-land-vertical-farming-food-production","story":"The Innovation Hub for Controlled-Environment Agricultureat the James Hutton Institute is a collaboration between government agri-tech centre Crop Health and Protection , and Liberty Produce, a London-based farming technology company with expertise in horticultural lighting and fertigation systems.The centre has been purpose built for research and development and will help the industry to understand and tackle barriers to the adoption of hydroponic production systems.: Firm in cash bid to make plant-based construction insulationThe aim of the centre, which houses Liberty Produces Future Farming Hub, is to drive innovations that reduce operational costs and improve the yields from controlled-environment farms, providing benefits to growers, food processors and consumers, as well as help farmers meet food requirements and limit further damage to the environment.Director of Liberty Produce, Zeina Chapman said: \"What we do is develop technology with a focus on trying to reduce the operational costs and the capital costs of running these systems, as well as improving the yield.\"The biggest challenge growers have at the moment is that vertical farming is really only on the cusp of commercial viability and thats because the cost of the capital expenditure required to build these systems is enormous, the operational costs are still very high, theyre still quite labour intensive.\"Because of this, most producers can only grow high value crops such as micro greens, which can be sold for up to pound per kilogram, and herbs.But Liberty Produce, founded in , wants to change that by developing new technologies with a focus on reducing costs these systems can be adopted globally.Vertical farming grows produce in layers indoors in sometimes soil-less systems aided by LED lights either by hydroponics, where roots are continuously in moisture in the growing medium, or aeroponics, where the produce is misted and doesnt rely on a growing medium.They are seen as a sustainable alternative to cultivating land not currently used for food, can withstand iable and increasingly extreme weather, eliminate the use of agrichemicals and reduce water use.: Tennentrsquos serves up ways to save the planetLiberty Produce will lead a pound. million project with eleven partners to accelerate the development of the UK vertical farming sector.Using the funds, awarded by Innovate UK, the farming hub willsupport the creation of an integrated technology system focused on reducing operational costs by  per cent, improving crop yield by  per cent and reducing necessary grower intervention through improved decision support and automation in lighting, nutrient and environmental control technologies.Some of the innovations that will be carried out at the centre will include designing high-efficiency LED lighting systems test growing regimes, lighting applications and nutrient mixes in a iety of crops.Vertical farming crops will complement traditional arable farming but Ms Chapman believes that more produce will be grown via the method as technologies advance and natural resources struggle to cater to growing populations.She said: \"I think they will become more mainstream for crops that are currently grown in fields or in glass houses.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Nicola Sturgeon: the Scottish Parliament’s greatest achievements viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

It neither meets the needs of the local community nor the standards people in Orkney have a right to expect from their leline service.“I have raised these concerns with the First Minister and Transport Secretary in the past, highlighting the impact on constituents. I was given assurances that it would be addressed in the new contract.“Given the announcement that Serco Northlink has been chosen as the preferred bidder, it is important that the Scottish Government now claries what the arrangements will be for the forthcoming refit period.#The new contract needs to address the failings of the current contract and ensure that this leline route is served during the refit period by a vessel that is fit for purpose”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However the rule was relaxed in  to allow promoters to stage a series of “Summer Sessions” concerts. Nine of them went ahead this year, including shows by Lewis Capaldi, Primal Scream. Chvrches and Madness.Heritage campaigners, community groups and environmentalists have been demanding a clampdown on the “commercialisation” of the gardens ahead of plans being submitted for a new £ million arena in West Princes Street Gardens within the next few months.Alan Cumming and KT Tunstall have agreed to perform at the -a-head event at the Lincoln Center in New York to kickstart the fundraising campaign for The Quaich Project, which the council is pursuing with the Ross Development Trust, which was set up by hotel developer Norman Springford to try to revive the use of the gardens.There have also been concerns about the impact of winter festival events on East Princes Street Gardens, which are traditionally home to fairground rides, bars and market stalls for six weeks each year.Cllr Wilson, who has responsibility for the staging of events in both gardens and the planned redevelopment, said the economic benefits generated by the city’s festivals and events were not fully understood by the public. Mr Wilson said: “It’s vitally important that the city is seen as being open for business and that people get a welcome to Edinburgh. “Some people are of the belief that you can cap or put an upper limit on certain things. As soon as you put out that kind of message you risk starting a decline. One-off things start a drt. “If we start saying we are not open and are not interested in events it will begin a steady and unstoppable decline in terms of the festivals and events in the city, and our international reputation. The economic benefit of events is vital to the city. People under-estimate that.“One good thing about the challenging of the value of festivals and events is that it makes people think about why we have them, and their purpose and benefit. There are many opinions concerts in the gardens and I know they are not to everyone’s taste, but they are to others. They are very popular and we have to take account of that. “The use of the gardens hasn’t changed and I’m not envisaging it changing in the future. There has been talk of privatisation or selling off the gardens. That is absolutely not the case. They will remain  per cent under the ownership of the gardens and we will be controlling and managing them.”He said he was in favour of community events being staged in the park every week as part of a strategy to “widen and deepen festival and event participation.” He also cited the th century origins of the “pleasure grounds” as a justication for them to be used regularly for events.He added: “I’m sure a lot of people are unaware that could have their own event in the gardens.“We have a very strong desire in the council to widen and deepen festival and event participation and support beyond the major festivals.“But with events that are large-scale and ticketed, for the people that go to them it is a community actvity. That has to be factored on. A lot of these events are sell-outs. Decisions we make have to be based on the facts.”Mr Wilson spoke out days after organisers of Edinburgh’s world-famous Hogmanay celebrations warned that the event’s future wold be put at riska clampdown is ordered on the “commercialisation” of Princes Street Gardens over the winter. Underbelly, which has an £, annual contract to produce the two events, say the scale and quality of three-day Hogmanay festival is now reliant on income generated from market stalls, bars and fairground rides.Mr Wilson said: “The consultation is about what people want from the Christmas and Hogmamay events. “It’s coming up to the end of the current contract so it seems like the right time to ask people. “That doesn’t mean to say that we’re in any way negative about what happens now. Some people have issues with what we’re doing just now and others love it.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish greens aim to return 16 msps at 2021 holyrood elections","story":"The Scottish Greens will aim to MSPs to Holyrood at the next Scottish Parliamentary elections in , the party#s autumn conference will be told today.Increasing awareness of the climate emergency among Scots will help the Greens’ message resonate at the next Holyrood campaign, co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater will the party gathering in Inverness.The party will use the event to unveil who has been selected to contest the regional lists in , with activists confident they can build the required support over the next  months to win two seats from each of the electoral regions used for Holyrood ballots.The Greens will claim they have aleady achiveved “considerable success” with its current crop of six MSPs, pointing to reforms Scotland’s income tax system, reversing the decline in local government funding, and winning new powers for councils to raise funds and take control of bus services.The confernece will also be told that other Scottish parties have coalesced around long term targets for emissions reductions without any short term measures to signicantly cut Scotland’s carbon footprint.Party co-leader Lorna Slater is expected to tell the conference: “Only the Greens understand the climate emergency, know what needs to be done, and are determined enough to deliver transformative change.“Every one of the  candidates we announce today can be elected in .“And just imagine the hope this could give us.

Scotland must have the chance to choose a better future as a matter of democratic necessity.“We have seen hundreds of thousands taking to the streets, making clear that Scotland’s voice will be heard.“And while Westminster politics are well and truly broken, more and more people are convinced that Scotland should grasp the opportunity to become an independent country.“Though the Tories will always try to hold us back, the unstoppable energy of our movement will ensure we keep moving Scotland forward to independence.”The opening day of the SNP conference is expected to see an attempt to force officials to add a debate on an alternative route to IndyRef to the agenda.Senior councillor Chris McEleny and MP Angus MacNeil, who are behind the plan, believe it is “vital” the party considers what to dothe UK Government refuses permission for a vote.Mr MacNeil said he felt the party had been engaging in “too much talk about the wrong referendum”, prioritising a drive for a second Brexit vote over a second independence referendum.He and Mr McEleny want the SNP to declare thatit wins a pro-independence majority at the next Westminster or Holyrood election, it will have earned a mandate to start talks on exiting the UK.The attempt to change the conference agenda will go ahead despite Nicola Sturgeon openly dismissing the idea, stressing there is no “short cut” to winning independence.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: “The very last thing that Scotland needs is a isive and unwanted second independence referendum next year.“The Brexit turmoil is causing deep isions and economic uncertainty, and a referendum on leaving the UK would cause catastrophic upheaval.She continued: “Nationalist politicians need to start listening to the people of Scotland.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself.

In the absence of Stormont the Permanent Secretary Noel Lavery needs to step up to the plate and ensure that both outgoing Invest NI CEO Alistair Hamilton and his replacement Kevin Holland leave no stone unturned in the quest to safeguard the future of this workforce. The reality is thatthis was a start up foreign investor everything would be done to ensure its success. This deal offers a new company, effectively a start up and all support that can be given should be given, Mr Thompson said.Yesterday afternoon, Jeff Wright i ssued a statement saying the failure to complete a deal lay with industrialist Jo Bamford.This was after Mr. Bamford had stated he had been asked for a ‘signicantly larger sum’ in relation to the deal.Mr. Wright’s statement read: “The facts of the matters are as follows - Mr. Bamford was advised on Friday, October  that any deal would include the entire premises at Galgorm including the factory, fixtures and fittings.“These were available for lease or purchase. Mr Bamford sought to gain unrelated additional farmlands which were not for sale. It is important to note that no other bidder sought at any time to link the farmlands to the business purchase.“Mr. Bamford, as his statement confirms, did not deal with these matters until am this morning. In his response he insisted he would not proceed with the deal unless the farmlands were included.“Mr. Wright does not recognise the explanation provided by Mr. Bamford as to why he failed to conclude the purchase of the business.Earlier on Thursday, Mr. Bamford had issued his own statement of clarication, saying:  “At am this morning I made an offer to the Wright family to match the asking price for the Wrightbus factory and land. “This includes a sum to match the amount that the factory and associated land was purchased for two years ago from JTI. “Mr Wright has since refused this offer and has now asked for a signicantly higher sum of money.

Work was due to begin on the £.million project in August, but campaigners had occupied the green for over  days in a bid to block the development. Since , Friends of Glassmullin Open Greenhave campaigned against the facility, which is funded by Education NI for De La Salle College.In recent days, however, through consultation and engagement, the school and local community representatives have reached an agreement that will pave the way for the new G pitch. Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community. We are excited to see the project come to fruition and are looking forward to participating and working with the newly formed committee to ensure community cohesion.#Construction of the facility is due to start imminently partnered with ongoing engagement across residents and interest groups via the newly formed joint committee."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"blessed trinity students set for south africa","story":"NINE Year  students from Blessed Trinity College are preparing for the trip of a letime to South Africa.The young people have teamed up with Paddy Doyle from New Lodge Youth Centre and the Connections Youth Project.They will travel to South Africa on October  to spend  days working on a number of dferent projects in Durban and the surrounding towns and villages before ing home on November .This is the first time the project has been run with a school and Bernadette Little, Vice-Principal of Blessed Trinity College Antrim Road site, is delighted with the upcoming opportunity for the students.“We are happy and privileged to have been asked to come on board the project,” she explained.“We ran an internal application process open to all students and there was a lot of interest,” she said. “They then went for an interview to sell their qualities and skills before the final nine were chosen. There has been a lot of work done already with a lot of preparation and education about culture in South Africa.“It is once in a letime opportunity and will give the students more of a clear direction of what they want to do in le when they come back.”Student Ryan McCarthy explained more about what the trip will entail.“We had to do a lot of fundraising which involved bag packing and setting up pages on Facebook to raise the £, required for cover our travel and donate towards dferent projects out there,” he said. “The first seven days we will spend in homeless shelters before moving to work in villages and towns outside Durban. We will be fully integrated in the community and there will be no luxuries.“We will live with local people and their families and help build houses and other things to help the community and work on dferent projects.“It will be very much a hands-on experience. It is not a holiday for us. We have also been learning the Zulu culture which is everything from song, language, games and dance, which we will use to communicate with the children who don’t speak much English. We want to respect their culture and integrate ourselves into theirs.”Another student, Holly O’Neill, believes she will take a lot from the experience.“I think the trip will teach us a lot about how we take for granted how we live back at home,” she said. “These people in South Africa are poor. We will feel lucky to live here. People complain about all the bad stuff in the news here but it is nothing compared to over there. People have nothing compared to us. The whole experience so far has given us all more confidence. We were all shy and didn’t talk much to each other but now we are all talking more and working together as a team.“The travel is daunting – around  hours – but we are all looking forward to it and want to make the most out of it. I remember the feeling when I got picked for this le changing experience, I was speechless.“The amount of dedication that has to be put in is crazy, but working as a team I know we can get through it.“Something that has really been outstanding for me has definitely been the Monday night groups that I look forward to for a good laugh and good craic.“I’m just so thankful to have been chosen for this le changing experience.”Paddy Doyle from Connections Youth Project added: “I wanted to change the project a bit and develop young leaders within a school environment.“The young people have worked really hard in their preparation so far and I know we are going to have a successful trip. I can’t wait for it.

This is now a dysal system,” she said.“At the heart of this is the refusal of those with the biggest mandates to take the responsibility for governing which comes with those mandates. They know well a deal has long been available but decisions which are unpopular in the short term will need to be made for the long-term good of the healthcare system and public health.“We must never stop being shocked by figures such as these, which are unacceptable and show a decline in planning for the future, going back many years. It is time for comprehensive transformation or there simply will not be a public health service for the next generation # and it is time those with the big mandates took responsibility for delivery of it.”SDLP Deputy Leader Nichola Mallon called the waiting times for a first neurology outpatient appointment “unacceptable”.The North Belfast MLA said that staff are working tirelessly to manage demand while also coping with the biggest patient recall in history. “Neurology patients, people living with conditions like Parkinson’s disease, Motor Neurone disease or multiple sclerosis, should not be forced to endure the pain, worry and uncertainty of waiting over a year to be seen,” she said. “That’s the cruel reality for over , people who understand the seriousness of their condition and desperately want to be seen and treated as quickly as possible.“These patients and the staff working in neurology units deserve better. Aside from the immense challenge of having almost , people on the neurology waiting list, doctors and nurses are trying their best to cope with the biggest patient recall in our history. It must feel overwhelming.“We have had reviews of neurology services before. I have no doubt that the final report will reach similar conclusions with similar recommendations. They cannot be allowed to sit on a shelf gathering dust while real people suffer on hospital waiting lists. This is a scandal and we all have to commit to addressing it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the great outdoors at a local nursery school","story":"AIDAN Crean fully understands young people’s concern for nature and the future of our planet – in fact the west Belfast environmental supremo ‘got it’ well before anyone  did.When he was young and with the Troubles raging all around, nature and the environment weren’t high on many people’s list of priorities. But Aidan was intrigued by the natural world – just like so many youngsters today – and when he was  his le changed forever when a simple thing happened – his father bought him a pair of binoculars so he could better study the birds he spent so much time watching in the gardens of Riverdale.Those old second-hand binoculars were the catalyst that propelled him on a le journey that culminated this week in the opening of an Eco Wildle Garden at St Michael’s Nursery School in Andersonstown.The garden was a labour of love for Aidan and fellow wildle crusader Debbie ‘Doolittle’ Nelson. Their plan to build a nature haven for kids – rather than a common play park – got the full backing of the school. Principal Clare McAllister said the children now choose themselves to go outdoors every day.“They just love to be outside in the middle of nature – so many children don’t get the opportunity to getoutside. And I think this park will encourage children and parents to use our parks and public amenities more,” she said. Board of Governors chairperson Sean Óg McGuinness said that even bad weather doesn’t deter the kids. “They just put on their wet gear and can’t wait to get out to play. It’s a nature paradise.”Aidan and Debbie spent months designing and perfecting the garden – Debbie herself did all the joinery work, making the  bird boxes, as well as hedgehog havens in each corner and a wildle pond.“I planted giant water lilies for dragonflies to rest on, and just as I was putting them in during the summer a dragonfly flew by,” said Debbie. “So even though we’re in the heart of West Belfast there are still some rarities about here.”Debbie even managed to allow pathways for hedgehogs to the fenced-off pond by cutting mini-archways into the fence. “The pond itself has wee ramps so frogs and newts and hedgehogs can safely visit it,” she said.And the nestboxes aren’t just to attract garden birds – one at the front of the school has been designed for kestrels. Aidan said: “You can just imagine the faces of the kidsa pair of kestrels take up residence here. It would be fantastic.”In fact the boxes are designed to provide homes for seven other species – including swts, robins, house sparrows, treecreepers and bats. The children’s eco garden – behind the school beside St Michael’s church – is sheltered by giant trees including oaks that long predate the school – “it could be one of the oldest oak trees in West Belfast,” said Aidan.He added: “We need to be teaching young ones, today, at home, in school and crucially in the nursery – the formative years – how to appreciate and look after wildle, the pollinators, birds, bats, hedgehogs, vegetables, amphibians, orchards and ultimately ourselves so to be best placed in years to come to deal with all the many complex survival challenges ahead for people and bioersity.” Things were so dferent when Aidan was young. The binoculars which helped instil a love of nature unfortunately didn’t last long. British soldiers based in nearby Casement noticed them being used at an upstairs window and thought they were being spied on. They raided his house, running up the stairs to find Aidan birdwatching from his bedroom.The soldiers confiscated the binoculars. “The gave me a wee ticket, and said I could collect them when the Troubles were over,” Aidan said this week. “I never imagined that would be  years later!” Aidan never got his hands on those binoculars again, but he attributes that short time spent with that special gt from his father to his lelong love of nature. Five years later, his father was killed by a British army Saracen in a crash on the Falls Road.“Those binoculars launched me on the journey that I’m still enjoying. And I hope this eco garden will have the same effect by inspiring the next generation of youngsters,” he said."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38573258.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_109142883_constabledowney.jpg","title":"10k for psni officer discriminated against","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

__constabledowney.jpgEmailA police firearms officer who was suspended for refusing to shave his beard has said he has been \"vindicated\" after an employment tribunal found he had been discriminated against..pushConstable Gordon Downey was temporarily transferred from the predominantly male Armed Response Unitin February  for not being willing to comply with a policy forcing officers to be clean-shaven.He later brought an employment tribunal case against then-Chief Constable George Hamilton claiming he had been discriminated against, a view which was supported by an employment tribunal.The PSNI has said it is aware of the tribunals findings and said it is currently examining the detail.Speaking to BBC News NI, Constable Downey said: \"To be turfed out of the unit, with little or no notice, for refusal to shave off a moustache, which doesnt affect the equipment Ive been issued with, is total madness.\"Read MoreMoustache would have to be a ‘belter’ to impair PSNI mask, tribunal toldPSNI ponytail rule not enforced like one for beards, tribunal toldPSNI firearms officer tells tribunal of his face mask concernsNew rules outlawing beards and facial hair were implemented in  for some units in the PSNI due to health and safety concerns.The updated policy required these officers to \"remain clean shaven whilst on duty\" for health and safety reasons.The case centred over whether respiratory masks used in certain police units, and which are supposed to be airtight, can be used safelythe officer has facial hair.Expert advice to the tribunal  previously claimed men would need \"a moustache like a walrus\" for the equipment not to work properly.\"The policy itself was being enforced against men under health and safety grounds, and yet females within our unit had hair in contravention of the same policy, not facial hair but head hair, where there was a grab risk,\" Constable Downey said.\"So the policy was being enforced against men and not against female officers.\"Constable Downey said he tried to accommodate the policy by shaving his beard to a moustache but was also asked to remove that.\"As an older person with a receding hairline and alopecia who is slightly overweight all I can do is grow a bit of fur on my top lip, and to have that removed for absolutely no reason is wrong,\" he said.The unanimous decision of the tribunal was that Constable Downey was discriminated against contrary to the Sex DiscriminationOrder .He was awarded over £, for hurt feelings and loss of earnings.Niall McMullan from Worthingtons SolicitorsNiall McMullan from Worthingtons Solicitors, who represented Constable Downey, said it was an important ruling.\"This is a signicant ruling by the industrial tribunal, because it has essentially declared that the current PSNI policy is discriminating indirectly against males, in as far as the application of the policy is concerned,\" he said.\"I would like to see serious steps taken by the PSNI in relation to this decision.\"The tribunal were unequivocal in so far as they want the PSNI to review this decision and to ensure it has a less discriminatory effect on not just my client, but all male officers who it is relevant to.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38568793.ece/13a07/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Traffic1.jpg","title":"5000 northern ireland

A retest costs £.. It means that motorists spent almost £, on tests they didnt attend.The no-shows increased from , in July.Former Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said the number of people not turning up for MoTs was \"absolutely crazy\". He called for a thorough analysis of the \"deeply worrying\" figures.\"Its fair to say that the number of people who arent bringing their vehicles for appointments is shocking,\" he said. \"It does have an impact on waiting times for MoT tests.\"I would love to see a deeper analysis of the figures because we need to know why these people arent turning up.

I don’t mind it, I’ve eaten a couple of tonnes of it. I can sense it’s made with love and I can appreciate it.

I’m too polite, I was not brought up to reject any comestibles.”Perkins was asked whether she had ever considered entering politics.“I think it would kill me, I don’t think I would have the physical ability to distance myself from what’s happening,” she said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sue Perkins, right, hosted Bake Off on the BBC with Paul Hollywood, Mel Giedroyc and Mary Berry “I think the fury I feel I could not contain.

Other members carried a coffin with ‘NHS’ and ‘DIGNITY written on the side of it.Other messages on fake gravestones signied the death of human rights, mental healthcare, funding in education and health, and the loss of housing and welfare rights.It most certainly caught the attention of weekend shoppers who seemed confused as to whether or not it was a real funeral until they read the messages.At the Guildhall an excerpt from the film I Daniel Blake was played. It is from the funeral scene where his friend Katie reads the eulogy, including the speech Daniel had intended to read at an appeal for his jobseeker’s allowance.The speech describes his feelings about how the welfare system failed him by treating him like a dog instead of a man proud to have paid his dues to society.AAC member, Kat Healy, took to the steps of the Guildhall first to thank those who turned out for the march. In the spirit of the original civil rights march people were taking a stand against injustice, she said.People Before Profit Councillor, Shaun Harkin, also reflected on the march in  which “changed history here in the North of Ireland”. He said the numbers turning out to protest at present don’t accurately represent the depth of “anger” in the local community which is “growing and growing”.Cllr Harkin added that it is important to put pressure on “leaders” to address the devastation felt by local communities.‘Direct Action’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnother AAC member from Strabane, Michael Mclaughlin, told the crowd that he has been fighting against welfare reform for the best part of a decade.“The system is broken,” he said, and is part of an “ideological attack” on the working class. He referred to a research paper published by a university in Sheffield which studied the impact of welfare reform in the UK.A table included in that report which took in all  local authorities in the UK at the time, shows that people living in Derry and Strabane will be impacted the most with working age adults anticipated to be £ worse off per annum. Blackpool sits at the top of the table, Derry is second, Strabane third and Belfast is fourth.Mr McLaughlin said people can point the finger at Stormont but also need to look “closer to home”. It is time to “inject radicalism into activism”, he said, by getting working class people out on the streets and occupying offices were these cuts are being implemented.“We need to organise a direct action campaign against neo-liberalism, against austerity and expose and call out the parties that have let everybody down.”Member of the Irish Travelling Community, Martin McDonagh, said he was proud to be taking action and made clear that his community has felt the impact of cuts more than most.Becca Bor of Alliance for Choice slammed the two-child policy and benefit cap which she said have “massively increased” child poverty. Although primarily campaigning for free safe legal and local abortion in Ireland, the group has also fought “tooth and nail” against welfare reform, she said.She added that families are having to “scrape” money together essentials and said there is a need to fight so that women and families “have what they need”.The final speaker on the day, Goretti Horgan, of Derry Trades Union Council said large families have been impacted most by benefit caps and self-employed workers such as taxi drivers.She urged people to join a trade union, saying weekends off, holiday pay and sick pay wouldn’t exist without trade unions. “Don’t believe the hype when the Tories say they’re bringing in a living wage, read the small print, they’re saying it will happen in five years by which time normal wage increases will have brought it to that level,” she concluded."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8xMFxcXC8xMDE2NDg0N1xcXC9HcmFkZS1BLW9mZmljZS1zcGFjZS1FYnJpbmd0b24ucG5nXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjY0NyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjM0MCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvY2FjaGUucmVzaXplZC5jb1xcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiY2RlMmYyZjIyZWUwODc0M2UzZWEzMzJhY2EzNjFmNzA2Mjc2NjA3ZSJ9/grade-a-office-space-ebrington.png","title":"construction ebrington office blocks track commence next month","story":"Construction of Grade A office space at Ebrington is set to commence next month, The Executive Office has confirmed.The buildings will provide ,ft² of office space and are due to open in mid-.

The popular presenter has a close affinity to the Down side, having been brought up in Burren, and will bring plenty of fun and laughter to the proceedings.Louise Kearney, part of the organising committee, said excitement is building in the area on the countdown to the historic night in the club on Saturday, October .She added: ldquoWe are delighted the Down legends are coming to spend a special evening in our clubrooms. It will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with All-Ireland winners. We are very proud to have two Loughinisland men who gave so much to the county, and continue to give so much to our club and community.Itrsquos a night not to be missed as this is a landmark year for the Down side who created history when they brought Sam Maguire across the border for the fth time.Louise said: ldquoIt may be one of the last times the squad will be together in a club in this capacity for a number of years and we are grateful they are spending that time with us. We will have a relaxed but enthralling evening as we look back at the glory days.While the spotlight will be on the Down legends, families from the Loughinisland Justice Group will be special guests at the event and their loved ones will be remembered during the night.Louise added: ldquoWe will also take time to remember that  was such a dficult year for Loughinisland. A quarter of a century on from the massacre, we will think back on the impact of the Down win on the community, the uplt that the team brought and the footballing spirit which helped people through the darkest days. We have a lot of stories to hear.The organisers have secured the Sam Maguire and Anglo-Celt cups for the event so there will be opportunities on the night to get photographs taken alongside the Down greats and the legendary silverware.Former Down and Loughinisland player Alan Molloy, who is also one of the organisers, said it was a remarkable feat that a small rural club like Loughinisland had three medals from the great teams of the s and their achievements had brought much joy and prestige to the club.He added: ldquoThis will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with these All-Ireland winners, including Loughinisland men Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, who gave so much to the county and continue to give so much to our club and community.ldquoGary Mason is the proud owner of two medals, from the victories in  and . Whilst Gerard Colgan was playing for An Riocht in , he spent the last of his playing days with Loughinisland. Both players are now passing on their valuable knowledge to the future generations through coaching our underage teams.ldquoThe club is very grateful that so many legends of the  team are ing to spend this evening with us. This will be a relaxed evening where we can sit back and listen to the enthralling stories from those glory days.The event will be sponsored by The Irish News and the organising committee would like to thank them for their support and backing.Tickets can be purchased in OrsquoToolersquos bar, Loughinisland GAC clubrooms, or by contacting the clubrsquos Facebook page, email loughinislandgac@gmail, or calling  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Armstrong.jpg","title":"Armstrong takes second at Lurgan  ","story":"THE first round of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross League, hosted by Apollo CC at Lurgan Park, took place on Sunday.It was certainly a testing time for the course setters. There was a clearly much debate from the competitors about how muddy it was going to be andthey would have enough wet weather gear.As it turned out, the sun would appear and the rain would disappear leaving Lurgan Park looking beautully tranquil.The first race up was the U- race with Fiadh Kellett, Hugh and Conor Hetherington flying the flag for Dromara CC and more importantly loving the mud. Great to see them enjoying it.The U-s boysrsquo race saw young Oscar McBride loving the mud as he battled through the crown to claim eighth place in a competitive race.Aoe Kellett was in a tough U- girlsrsquo race that saw her put in a tremendous effort to claim third place with second place not far away. A great start to her league campaign and pressure on dad to produce in his race.James Armstrong has had a great summer of cycling and has taken this rich vein of form into the cyclo-cross. Curtis McKee, from Maryland Wheelers, would keep James from the top spot of the podium, but only by a mere six seconds.With junior members having set the scene at the cyclocross it was time for the senior team to get on their bikes.In the MTB Support race Mick Foley, fresh back from injury and claiming to be unfit, tore through the mud to claim a top  finish leaving expectations that he can only get better and better.The club had a large representation in the B race which saw  riders competing.It didnrsquot last long for Gibson Chambers as he got caught up in a crash at the start.This left Paul Hamilton taking the honour of first Dromara man home in sixth place, not far behind was Richard Cowan in eighth, Brian Kellett managed to take th and hold off Darren McCann, just.Adi Booth took the bragging rights as he finished ahead of Bryce Hetherington and Mike Barton finishing st, rd and th respectively. Robert Davison finished in th with John McGuigan taking th.The Dromara Ladies had a full team out and it was Diane Wilson on her comeback who was first Dromara Lady home in fth with Martina Hawkins finishing closely behind in th. Andra Hamilton was enjoying the course and claimed a battling th place.The final race of the day was the menrsquos A race which saw Barry Kellett, Neil Armstrong and Derek Graham take to the start line.Kellett showed that moving the M category certainly hasnrsquot slowed him down as he battled with his younger rival Graham Boyd, from McConvey Cycles, for the top spot.This time it was Graham who held on to take the win, but an excellent second place and top M for Barry. Neil Armstrong claimed th just ahead of Derek Graham in th. When the scores where totalled up, it left Dromara CC taking the third team prize.Many thanks go to Apollo CC for putting on a tremendous event, considering the awful weather through the week.

We believe he is still finding out the additional things he can do with his new hand and therersquos still improvements ahead.Mr Moore said Alfie learnt to write with his left hand and still does but there is hope that over time, that he might be able to write and use his prosthesis hand for everything he normally does with his left hand.He says that Alfiersquos classmates and other pupils have accepted the new addition to the P pupil very well.Mr Moore added: ldquoWersquore never have had any problems with other children understanding about Alfie. I think adults could learn from children as they might ask a question about the arm but once itrsquos answered, they move on as they are very accepting..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Brief.jpg","title":"Brief to redevelop Irish Street closer  ","story":"A DEVELOPMENT brief designed to transform the former Irish Street police station site in Downpatrick and a number of adjacent empty buildings could be ready within weeks, the Down Recorder understands.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy.Final agreement has been reached with all key stakeholders to draw up a dedicated team to come up with a development brief which will outline what the local authority would like to see developed at a huge area of land.The brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area, while there are also plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise its potential and make the most of its historical heritage.When completed, the development brief will be advertised, inviting third parties to come forward with viable proposals for the site that will result in sustainable regeneration in Downpatrick town centre.It has also been confirmed that permission has been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.A number of the vacant buildings will be bulldozed to open up a huge area at the rear of the former police station, with the proposed development site also including the local authority-owned car park.But the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious multi-million pound regeneration plan. It is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Council officials insist that the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and while they concede that preserving the building will be a challenge, it is also presents an opportunity to something exciting with it.The heritage value of the site, which extends as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, is something council officials are not only keen to preserve, but build upon as they work with the Department for Communities to maximise the potential of the site.The government department, which has already acquired the former PSNI base, is working in partnership with the local authority to help bring new investment to Downpatrick town centre.Leading brands such as Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains, along with several other big names, are keen to invest in Downpatrick, but at present cannot identy suitable accommodation to meet their respective needs.Those behind the Irish Street plan hope that a redevelopment scheme can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses which have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for many years.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed confirmation that work on the development brief could be completed shortly.He believes that the transformation of the former police base and adjacent land can provide Downpatrick with a signicant economic boost, creating new retail space and much-needed jobs.Cllr Curran reiterated the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town.He said many will be looking forward to seeing the detail of the development brief and the potential options for a hugely important development site in the heart of Downpatrick.ldquoThere has been no signicant retail investment in the town for quite some time.

Bright finally got their hands on the JFC trophy after a pulsating victory over Aughlisnafin at Pairc Esler on Sunday.Despite having lost the previous six finals they have appeared in, the Ballynoe-based club went into the clash full of confidence and it showed as they broke Aughlisnafinrsquos hearts with an expansive display.The game ebbed and flowed throughout with fortune favouring the brave.Aughlisnafin seized the early initiative before the departure of Mark Stratton to a straight red card threatened to derail their challenge.However, Bright were unable to take real advantage and just when they made their move, Seamas Tumelty joined Stratton for an early shower.The game opened up at this stage with Bright showing a greater composure to prevent Aughlisnafin from completing the double in a thrilling finale to the game.Oran Flanagan and Cailean Toner exchanged early scores in a positive opening to the game before a long range point from the impressive Adam Garland and a good effort from Shane McCann sent the lsquoFin into a - to - lead by the sixth minute.The action was hot and heavy all over the park, but Stratton saw red in the th minute and Bright took full advantage.Sam Dinu reduced the deficit to a single point before the accurate Flanagan converted a free to restore the lsquoFinrsquos two-point lead.Dinu and Breannain McComiskey swapped scores before two Flanagan frees stretched Aughlisnafinrsquos lead to four points, despite being down to  men.Kyran Smythrsquos side held on grimly to the lsquoFinrsquos coat tails and just before the break Gareth George helped breathe new le into Brightrsquos challenge when he pointed from a rsquo to leave his side trailing - to - at half-time.The second half was in its infancy when Bright lay down their marker.A blistering spell of attacking football yielded unanswered points from Declan Trainor, Kevin Groves and the ubiquitous George to draw level.There was only one team in it at this stage, but Bright went and shot themselves in the foot when Tumelty fell foul of the referee and was shown the red card.Brightrsquos heads were now down and Flanagan punished the indiscretion when he pointed the lsquoFin into a - to - lead after  minutes.Smyth sent for the cavalry at this stage and it duly arrived in the shape of Matt McKiernan.The rangy forward was on hand to steer the ball past Calum Croskery and when Toner quickly tagged on a point, Bright suddenly and from nowhere, were three points clear, - to -.Driven on remorselessly by Donagh Steele, Aughlisnafin battled back and points from Sean Fitzsimmons and two from Flanagan had it all square again with  minutes gone.The game was still being played at a hectic pace and with  minutes gone, Garland pointed the lsquoFin into a deserved, but precarious - to - lead.Dinu held his nerve to level matters, but Aughlisnafin went back in front thanks to a point from Shea Croskery. Corey Ranaghan quickly levelled matters, but that man Croskery gave his side a - to - lead with less than eight minutes remaining.Fingernails were being bitten to the quick as Bright went in search of the equaliser and it arrived less than a minute later via a Kevin Groves free.It was now a case of who dares wins as the game hurtled to a conclusion and points from George, Dinu and Matthew Burns had Bright literally home and hosed.Aughlisnafin refused to capitulate and they knew that only a goal would do, but all they could muster in added time was a point from Flanagan as Bright held on for an historic win.Bright: Michael Farrand, Barry Mageean, Marc Burke, Seamas Tumelty, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Nicholas OrsquoConnor, Jack McLaughlin, Corey Ranaghan , Cailean Toner , Sam Dinu , Kevin Groves , Declan Trainor , Owen McEvoy, Gareth George , Rian Tempany.

The exercise is expected to take around  months to complete.Council officials will examine each community centre in detail with the exercise looking at the population they serve, the number of young people in their area, crime statistics andthe facilities are located in so-called neighbourhood renewal areas.One area the review will examine will be Crossgar where local people are keen to see new community centre provided.A major feasibility study was carried out a number of years ago with a site adjacent to St Colmcillersquos High School in the village identied as the preferred location for a new community and sports centre. While a new facility was never constructed, the forthcoming review will examinethe need for it remains.The idea of the community centre probe is to determine potential under provision and where new facilities may be required moving forward.Council officials will also look to seethere is over provision in any areas but insist there are no plans to close any existing centres. They argue that the main driver is about increasing and improving community provision across the district.While itrsquos still early days, council officials say they will work through the process over the next year and will keep ratepayers fully informed about consultation meetings which will be held across all seven district electoral areas to ensure everyone has an opportunity to have their say.Described as a ldquosignicant piece of work, the review will also include discussions with community groups and associations.Insisting that the review is not about closing community centres, council officials say the examination of current provision will focus on where they are located and local need. And they have suggested that the exercise could potentially throw up issues which surfaced during the playground strategy which resulted in some play parks amalgamating.Council officials say while the intention is not to close any centres at this stage, the review will focus on potential gaps in current provision to help form strategic decisions about where to build new centresthis is required.The review will also examine which community centres may require refurbishment and potential extensions to allow them to meet increasing demand.Council officials have confirmed that a number of the districtrsquos community centres are part-funded by the Department for Communities with a number also run by local groups and associations.Ahead of the community centre review, council officials have been conducting an exercise looking at the user figures and the number of programmes that the respective centres deliver. Part of the forthcoming review will also take a critical look at funding streams to help increase centre usage.Council officials say the parks and open spaces strategy will identy those that need upgraded and those which are not necessarily adding any value. It will examine those that can be improved with the review rolled out over the next  months.When the community centre and parks and open spaces review has been completed, initial reports will be debated by the local authorityrsquos Active and Health Communities Committee which will then make recommendations to the full councilto agree a new strategy moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 9%2C 1979  ","story":"STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash Police have still not recovered the body of the second man drowned on a fishing trip to Strangford Lough at the weekend.At Downpatrick police station mdash from where the search operation was co-ordinated mdash police say there is no hope that  year-old Carrickfergus man, Mr John Craig, is still alive.They believe that Mr Craigrsquos body has been swept out into the Irish Sea and search has now been stretched to the Isle of Man.Mr Craig went in a -foot fibre glass cabin cruiser to fish for mackerel bait on Saturday afternoon, along with with Peter Johnson , from Woodcroft Rise, Braniel, Belfast.In the early hours of Sunday morning police were alerted by the relatives of the two men, anxious that neither had ed.

No one player has a bigger or more important job than anyone .They are in this together and they have an unfaltering belief in their own ability and work on the motto thatyou fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Martin McCourt has dislodged the experienced Niall Kane in goal for the last few games and could well hold on to the number one spot for the final.One thing for certain, bar injury, is that the five Branagan brothers will start, four in defence, with Eugene lining out at corner forward, but given a licence to roam.They epitomise everything good about Kilcoo. Honest, resolute, determined and committed.Ryan McEvoy, Dylan Ward and Aaron Morgan should be tasked with winning the ball in the middle of the park and supplying Paul Devlin, Conor Laverty and the Johnston brothers Ryan and Jerome mdash not forgetting younger brother Shealan when he is called upon.Kilcoo also have serious strength on the bench and in addition to Johnston the younger, they can call on Anthony Morgan, Paddy Devlin, Sean OHanlon, James McClean and Felim McGreevy,.Warrenpoint have made their way through some tricky ties unbeaten and along the way have accounted for An Riocht , Ballyholland , Longstoneand Ballyholland in the semi-final, - to -.Manager Niall McAleenan has the nucleus of the squad that won the IFC title in  and has also introduced some talented teenagers.He will rely on Adam Lynch, Pat Murdock, Ryan McAleenan, John Boyle, Eoghan Byrne and Ciaran McCartan to keep the Kilcoo attack quiet, bit few defences ever manage it.The Point cant afford to play in a defensive manner come Sunday. They must attack Kilcoo and utilise their magical set of forwards.McAleenans men have shipped a lot of scores in the league and to invite Kilcoo on to them would not be advisable.Thats why going at Kilcoo from the off and getting top scorer Ross McGarry involved early on is essential.McGarry is the one player who has the ability and temperament to unsettle Kilcoo.He is not the biggest full forward in the game, but he has pace, bravery and rarely misses in front of goal.He is undoubtedly Warrenpoints ace in the pack and along with the Boyle brothers adds a touch of class to the Points challenge.McGarry relies heavily on Donagh McAleenan, Ruairi McCormick, Aaron Magee, Ryan Mallon and Ryan Boyle and this unit must be firing on all cylindersWarrenpoint are to cause a shock win.Kilcoo are red hot favourites at   with a generous   being offered on Warrenpoint.

The key issue we have to address is the presence of a wet weather centre in the resort which I would suggest includes a fun-type family pool, he said.ldquoI believe that alongside this there needs to be a few swimming lanes to accommodate the needs of local people who have not had access to modern leisure facilities for some considerable time.Cllr Clarke said this issue needed to be flagged up as part of the consultation process on the way forward.He said it was important that elected representatives highlighted the needs of local people during the process.ldquoWe are talking about a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a modern leisure facility in Newcastle and we will not be settling for less. The location is good and while there may be issues with parking, these are not insurmountable.ldquoWe are talking about a complete new build which will maximise the large area of space at the rear of the existing centre and I would be keen to see a high quality design, comprising wood and glass, he said.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an eco-friendly building, which is both sustainable and carbon neutral..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Planners.jpg","title":"Planners recommend expansion at Newcastle’s Barbican supermarket  ","story":"A LEADING Newcastle business is in line for a major extension.Planners are recommending that mdash subject to a number of conditions mdash an amended proposal to expand the Barbican filling station at the Dundrum Road in the resort should be given the green light.The approval recommendation is due to be discussed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Wednesday of next week.The proposal includes the redevelopment of the existing petrol station and forecourt and extending the storersquos retail space.

The first leboat, The Faith, was commissioned the following year.With the introduction of fast inshore leboats that were capable of making way against strong tidal currents, mdash such as currents up to eight knots experienced in the Strangford Narrowsmdash it was decided in  to place a single-engine C class leboat in Portaferry for evaluation.The leboat quickly proved to be a success and a twin engine D class was commissioned.

than at first thought.Roads officials have this week confirmed the road will remain closed until October  as part of a pound, improvement scheme at Collinsrsquo Corner where five roads converge.Work on the scheme mdash which started last month and is due to complete in November mdash includes a new footpath at the Killough Road and a new left turn lane from Pound Lane into the Killough Road.Other aspects of the scheme include upgrading existing traffic signal equipment and the introduction of a one-way traffic systemon Lower Stream Street from the junction towards Racecourse Hill.Roads officials say the scheme should improve traffic progression and that due to the nature of the work involved, it will be necessary to operate a number of off-peak road and lane closures.Signed ersions will be provided with the Department of Infrastructure asking motorists to comply with all temporary traffic restrictions and to drive with care when travelling through, or in the vicinity of the works to help ensure the safety of road users and workers.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he was pleased with the progress on the scheme and believes that extending the closure at Pound Lane should result in major problems for drivers.ldquoWork on the upgrade appears to be progressing well and it is my understanding that there have been no major disruptions, he said.Cllr Curran also remains keen for senior engineers from the Department for Infrastructure to sit down with local politicians to discuss Downpatrickrsquos congestion issue and look at innovative ways of addressing a problem.He views such a meeting as part of a two-pronged approach, with a second meeting between MLAs and the government departmentrsquos permanent secretary.Roads officials have come up with what has been described as a short, medium and long term strategy to deal with the congestion issue in Downpatrick, with Cllr Curran keen to see the congestion issues in Edward Street addressed.ldquoAs I have said previously, we need to get round the table with roads engineers and look at all options moving forward, he said.ldquoClearly there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem

","story":"BALLYNAHINCH shook off their insipid displays in the SONI Premiership to push much-fancied Terenure right to the wire in their first appearance back in AIL Division A since .The Dublin outfit were the form team over the second half of last season and having recently clinched the Leinster Senior League title, were heavy favourites with pundits and bookmakers prior to kick off.They were also almost at full strength, while the home side were patched up in midfield after losing Rory Butler to injury. Veteran centre Stuart Morrow was again pressed into service with Aaron Cairns ing on the wing following concussion.Up front Ben Cullen earned the starting loose head spot and hugely influential number  Conall Boomer ed from injury. However, with eight players involved in the Ulster A Celtic Cup game on Friday night and four more in South Africa with the Pro squad, Brian McLaughlinrsquos options were limited.Tom Stewart and Connor Rankin were released to take their places on the bench, but the team that took the field was largely drawn from the squad which had been under-performing over the pre-AIL period.A few honest words on Tuesday night and an exceptional week on the training paddock clearly made a big dference as the home side tore into their opponents from the whistle.Playing away from the clubhouse and into the wet and gusty conditions, they drove into the Terenure half and were rewarded for an excellent scrum with a penalty to allow Sean OrsquoHagan to give his side the lead.Some indiscipline from a visibly fired up home forward pack allowed Terenure the chance to gain a foothold in the home half, but a superb turnover from Boomer on former lsquoHinch prop Campbell Classon allowed Ryan Wilson to clear.Cairns was doing his best to keep the home support involved and after skinning his opposite number twice in quick succession, he proceeded to drive him almost into the home dugout with a massive hit which got the home crowd even more fired up.However, a three point lead was scant reward for Ballynahinch after  minutes and Terenure began to turn the screw.They had a clear scrum advantage with referee Kieran Barry taking umbrage with Cullenrsquos angles and following a scrum deep in lsquoHinch territory, they went through the phases and eventually drove prop Liam Hyland over for a try at the posts to take a - lead.Moments later a superb long grubber kick forced Cairns back over his own line and Terenure won another penalty from the resulting m scrum.Declining the shot at goal they opted for another scrum and another infringement led to a penalty try, taking the lead out to - after  minutes.Undaunted, Ballynahinch finished the half strongly when a trademark Rhys OrsquoDonnell show and go sent him flying up the left touchline and almost over in the corner. Stout defending from Terenure averted the immediate danger, but a penalty for offside allowed OrsquoHagan to kick another penalty and cut the gap to - at half-time.As conditions worsened there was belief around the ground that this was not an insurmountable deficit, but disaster struck early in the first half when replacement Rankin elected to move the ball from deep.His long pass to a flying Ross Adair was only inches off target, but allowed the prolic Jake Swaine to hack through and win the race for the line to take his side  points clear at -. Ballynahinch refused to lie down and used the conditions to dominate field position.Blindside Aaron Hall put his injury nightmare behind by driving Terenure back at every opportunity and OrsquoHaganrsquos deadly boot dragged them back into the game with two penalties. When the under pressure Terenure outfit conceded another penalty in their own , almost everyone in the ground expected another three points.The ever-alert OrsquoDonnell had other ideas as he took a quick tap penalty and weaved his way over to score at the posts.OrsquoHaganrsquos conversion made it  all and as the weather really closed in, the home side were the clear favourites as they piled on the pressure in search of a win.Terenure defended well and were handed a leline when Cairns elected to run a speculative clearance instead of launching it back downfield.The ball was knocked on in the centre of the pitch and with heavyweight lock James Simpson off, the field Terenure once again exploited their scrum superiority to milk a penalty.Swaine held his nerve to nail the kick which, although central, was made tricky by the grim conditions.Ballynahinch threw everything at a tiring Terenure defence as the game entered injury time and after more than  phases of hammering away around the m line OrsquoHagan called for thegoal.The slippery conditions and heavy pressure meant his kick was a little rushed and it dropped short and wide to allow the away side to mark the ball and kick it out for a hard-earned win.The locals will reflect on a game they probably should have won, but will take an enormous amount of positives from the performance after visibly stepping up their physicality.Small margins will make a huge dference in this league and the fixtures come fast over the next few weeks. lsquoHinch travel to UCC this weekend to take on a student side buoyed by their demolition of much-fancied Trinity at the weekend and with the squad still thin due to Ulster Arsquos involvement in the Celtic Cup final, skipper John Donnan will have to lt his men for another big effort. However, he will be a happier man after his team showed that they belong in this company.Ballynahinch: Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Johnny Blair, James Simpson, John Donnan , Aaron Hall, Olly Loughead, Conall Boomer, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Sean OrsquoHagan, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Stuart Morrow, George Pringle, Ross Adair.

Language is what makes the heart audible. We had a teacher who came to our primary school and taught me the meaning of my name. Gorm is the Irish word for blue. Gorman were the people whose hair was so black it had a blue sheen off it. I thought, ‘wow’. I was about nine, I wanted to find out more. “I started to learn Irish, I went away on summer courses. It’s important to me.“I understand that there are people from the same bit of ground as I am who speak Ulster-Scots to whom that is equally important. I wanted to find out more.“My dad would have used Ulster-Scots expressions at home before I realised what they were. He’d say things like ‘red up’ and called us gaunches, or better, carnaptious gaunches. One of my favourite words in any language is the word ‘thran’.”For the programme Damian s to the Ards peninsula as he tries to understand why, for so many people, Ulster-Scots and its literary heritage is still important and relevant today. He reconnects with Hugh Robinson, who helped him start a writers’ group there, and spends time with native speakers and scholars including Carole Gilmore and Elaine McFeeters.Of the Irish language act which has seen red lines drawn at Stormont, and the limited use of Ulster-Scots in the Province, Damian said: “In our part of the world there are dficult conversations still to be had and that being the case I just think we need all the language we can get.”In his spare time Damian teaches conversational English to a group of Syrian refuges in Wales: “As has been pointed out to me I’ve passed on quite a bit of Ulster–Scots. There are people from Aleppo and Homs who are running round Aberystwyth using words like ‘red up’ and ‘carnaptious’.”Huge interest in new book on RHI scandal by Sam McBrideLatest update from criminal cases heard at Portsmouth Magistrates Court Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingF**k the Pope and the I.R.A. -

A keen environmentalist, he says: ‘‘Only use water - don’t use floral foam, which is a micro plastic that doesn’t biodegrade, and gets into the water system.’’His approach to flower arrangement could best be described as organic. ‘‘It’s basically about looking at each thing and putting it into a vase of water and letting it tell you what it wants to do. I am not trying to think of a shape in advance. I’m letting the pieces dictate where they want to go, ’’ says Shane. ‘‘My whole ethos with flowers is that you take what the season gives you and try to make something beautul out of it.’’ Watching him transform the foliage and flowers - hydrangea, phlox, cotoneaster, Joe Pye weed, eucalyptus and more, into a theatrical display - is mesmerising he makes it look a cinch which, I can confirm, it is not. ‘‘All you need is an artistic eye and a love of nature and a love of growing things, more than a love of cut things. It’s trying to make them look comfortable, trying to make them look how they did when they were still alive,’’ says Shane. ‘‘I think a lot of people don’t look at gardens enough and nature. Anyone in Northern Ireland who could come to a garden like Clandeboye would be a better flower arranger very quickly.’’When he was a boy growing up in Belfast, Shane Connolly’s hero was Percy Thrower, the dapper godfather of TV gardening shows and regular on Blue Peter. Restoration of former Kelly’s coal building in Carrickfergus nearing completion Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"‘‘In Your Greenhouse with Percy Thrower was my go-to-bed book...yes, I was a really sad child,’’ laughs Shane. His parents bought him a starter greenhouse for his th birthday, and so began a lelong passion for plants. ‘‘I planted a grapevine. I grew melons. I learnt the facts of le from melons because in those days you had to take the male flower and fertilise the female flower, I had never heard of such a thing, but I did it because Percy Thrower in his book had said this is what you do.’’Shane studied Psychology at the University of Ulster, which he hated, but admitted he didn’t realise floristry was a career choice.‘‘Part of my degree was six months in London and I met a personwho was a floral designer and that was it - I just suddenly thought I could do that.‘‘He took things from a garden and put them in a really grand space and I just thought it was incredible. I couldn’t believe that it was so exciting.’’Back in Northern Ireland Shane wrote him a letter and said he would love to do what Michael did. ‘‘He could see that I was serious and he let me come and help him... carry buckets and wipe out dirty buckets and that sort of thing.‘‘After a few years I had finished my degree by then and knew I didn’t want to do Psychology anymore. Hegot me a job with a company called Pulbrook  Gould in London, where I worked for two years..and I never looked back.’’ Shane set up his eponymous company in  and has built an enviable reputation as a floral designer with a small, dedicated and talented team of floristsproviding flowers, plants, shrubs and trees for weddings, events and parties.He has a Royal Warrant of Appointment both to HRH The Prince of Wales and HM The Queen.What has that meant for his business ‘‘Oh, it means that some people get put off and think you’re too expensive,’’ he laughs. He designed the flowers for the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall for the Service of Dedication in St. George’s Chapel in  and in  was appointed artistic director of flowers for the wedding of the HRH Duke and HRH Duchess of Cambridge, includingthe bridal bouquet and headdresses for the Duchess of Cambridge and her bridesmaids.Was he nervous doing the flowers for such an auspicious occasion ‘‘Not until two days before. I think the thing that makes anybody nervous is the press - because I felt like it was just a lovely, normal family wedding and then suddenly you get asked questions by the press. I remember one of them asking ‘how do you feel thinking that millions of people are going to see your work ’ I hadn’t thought of that at all. You just don’t.‘‘I knew that it was pretty epic to be asked but I was more concerned about the logistics. You spend time with the bride and you spend time talking about things, but you don’t think of Joe Public having an opinion.’’HRH Duchess of Cambridge’s bouquet was small and subtle, dominated by whites and a little greenery.‘‘Everything was British, everything was seasonal and everything was from the Royal estate. ‘‘She had Lily of the Valley, a little touch of hyacinth, because in the language of flowers they symbolise the constancy of love and we thought that was a nice message, and she had some Sweet William, which was a bit fun.’’Shane was also responsible for the avenue of trees in Westminster Abbey - field maples and hornbeams.‘‘Nature decided that the trees weren’t going to be blossom trees that they were going to be green trees, because it was a really hot spring that year, so we were not in control of that. ‘‘The Duchess of Cambridge didn’t mind at all, luckily. I’ve had brides hyperventilate over the shade of pink, never mind to suddenly tell somebody, by the way, you’re not going to have blossom. She was fine, she said ‘oh well, that’s great’. She was a very calm bride. Incredibly calm.’’After the ceremony, everything was replanted, recycled or composted.As we talk, I try my best to copy Shane’s floral design, and it doesn’t look too bad he’s a great teacher. ‘‘Yours is definitely more feminine,’’ he says, admiring my handiwork. I’d never imagined Iwould enjoy flower arranging - truth be told, I thought it was more for pale, fragile ladies with a fondness for Laura Ashley frocks. Not a bit.This new-found passion won’t be stemmed!try catch  TrendingF**k the Pope and the I.R.A. - Loughshore Hotel defends decision not to intervene because risk of becoming something much worseTheres been a second attempt to abduct a N.I. child -

Where even six or seven years ago the UUP was regularly in the headlines for what it thought was the wrong reasons – internal spats, walkouts and arguments about which direction it should take – the party now struggles to be heard at all.Oscar Wilde’s aphorism that ‘there is only one thing in le worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about’ certainly applies to politics –not on every occasion, certainly over time.Politics is essentially a battle of ideas and it is dficult to win that battleone’s voice cannot even be heard..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button On Thursday night, Mr Swann announced that he had decided to bring forward his resignation from the Ulster Unionist leadership.In a brief statement, he said that having originally announced last month that he intended to step down as leader next February, he was now bringing that forward to November  “after consultation with family and close colleagues”.With the UUP having been on a near-continuous downward drt for two decades and now holding just  of the  Assembly seats, many people will assume that this contest has little wider relevance.Butthe party does not at this juncture arrest its decline, the implications could travel beyond the UUP. There is a signicant segment of unionism which for myriad reasons will never vote DUP.Whereas the DUP had in the latter years of Ian Paisley’s leadership and then under Peter Robinson been reaching out to become a broader church, the sense is that the party is now retreating somewhat from that stance, with some of its most moderate and capable figures such as Richard Bullick, Simon Hamilton and Alastair Ross walking away.As my colleague Ben Lowry has observed, it is illustrative of the limits of the DUP’s appeal that such a large minority of unionist voters still vote for the UUP – more than , in the last Assembly election – when the party is at such a low ebb.That in itself demonstrates the problem for unionismthe UUP now moves towards rapid implosion – those people will not vote for the DUP and in many cases are not attracted to the TUV so will, in all likelihood, be lost to the unionist column, regardless of whether they stay at home or vote for a party such as Alliance. \u2028That in itself will not make a united Ireland more likely. Regardless of how people vote in an election, a sht from the UUP to Alliance or to not voting at all is unlikely to be a signicant benefit to republicans in how people vote in any border poll.But that could hasten the calling of a plebiscite on the border. Although the Secretary of State retains a discretionary power to call a referendum on a united Ireland at any point, the obligation on him in the Northern Ireland Act  is woolly and based on whether, in his opinion, the referendum could be won by republicans.One way of gauging that is likely to be opinion polling, although the reputation of pollsters has been battered in recent years.Sinn Fein and SDLP in Downs Syndrome abortion row Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"But another criteria – and especiallythe Secretary of State of the day was looking for reasons to justy such a decision – could be the vote for unionist parties in an election.The last Assembly election saw unionism lose its Stormont majority for the first time in the history of Northern Ireland, yet there has been little evidence of unionism responding to that setback by radically altering its path.There is some justication in Mr Swann’s complaint that he was seen as a traditionalist unionist because he is an Orangeman and a Presbyterian from North Antrim when actually his policy positions have been far more nuanced.Clearly annoyed that he felt many in the media had framed him as a traditionalist leader despite his actions, such as addressing LGBT events, Mr Swann exuded a degree of exasperation when he was interviewed by the BBC’s Enda McClafferty last week.But while that frustration is understandable, it is in part an almost inevitable consequence of his party’s decline. A smaller party will always have to work doubly hard to be heard because its mandate is less demanding of airtime or column inches. That problem will follow his successor.Mr Swann’s decision this week has the immediate impact of dramatically shortening theof time which the party will have to debate its future.In less than a month the new leader will be in post – and perhaps find themselves already in the middle of a General Election campaign.The move to make a rapid decision about the leadership puts pressure on the tiny number of potential candidates – because the party has already tried most of those who on paper have the credentials for the job – to decide whether they want to be leader.Yesterday one of those talked about as an outside bet for ato the leadership, Mike Nesbitt, said that he would not be standing, revealing that he had been diagnosed with heart disease in  and believed that “the stresses of leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party are beyond me at present”.But evenhe is not back as leader, Mr Nesbitt will have some influence in the party’s future shape because it was under his leadership that the other two potential challengers, both former military men, were attracted to the UUP – a not inconsiderable feat, given that the DUP was and is entirely dominant and therefore offers more attractive career prospects.Thus far, only South Antrim MLA Steve Aiken has put himself forward. The Assembly chief whip is frequently trusted by the party to represent it in tricky media interviews although he has not always emerged unscathed.During an interview with Stephen Nolan ahead of the  Assembly election, the son of a trade unionist who once commanded a nuclear submarine confidently predicted that the UUP would be “the largest unionist party...I think we’re going to have more seats than Sinn Féin I think Sinn Féin have real problems out there”.In fact, Sinn Féin saw its vote surge while the UUP’s vote dropped to a record low.The other potential contender is former Royal Irish Regiment officer Doug Beattie – someone who left school without any qualications but who is more articulate and more skilled at debate than most MLAs.Although there are inidual issues – such as on legacy – where both men have been to the right of the DUP, they are overwhelmingly on the UUP’s liberal wing.That in itself presents this problem: If the UUP is to decide to move in a decisively more liberal direction to the DUP – a position which even some senior DUP figures privately say would benefit unionism by providing more choice to voters – it needs to consciously take that decision and for its members to realise what is happening.As it is, with only one candidate declared, there may not even be a contest andone is held it will now be brief.But aside from the policy argument for the UUP having a brutally honest debate about its future, for a party struggling to be heard, deciding on a coronation would in itself be passing up an opportunity to present its ideas to the shrinking group of people who will listen.try catch  TrendingF**k the Pope and the I.R.A. -

Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street. They deserve justice on their pensions and have my full support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

This is a signicant increase from the current figure of % and is said to be a \"world leading level, ensuring maximum value from wind and other sources\".

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says.

PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis.

From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar.
