Mondelez’s Oreo Mini snack pack and Freddo Face Cakes will be shrunk by the end of 2021.Many companies have decided to reformulate their products, often taking out some of the sugar, in order to reduce the calorie count, however this has been rejected by Mondelez for these products.Cadbury itself recently launched a new Dairy Milk chocolate bar variant with 30 per cent less sugar in response to concerns about rising obesity. In this case, it has changed the recipe to use corn fibre to replace some of the sugar.         A new version of the Cadbury Dairy Milk bar containing 30 per cent less sugar hit shelves today. Pictured: the amount of sugar in the original bar (left) vs. the new bar (right)The company claimed that the decision to shrink the products aimed at children, rather than introduce a healthier recipe, comes from its ‘commitment to taste’.UK Managing Director at Cadbury’s parent firm Mondelez International, Louise Stigant, said: ‘We want to play our part in tackling childhood obesity and are focusing on the areas where we can make the greatest impact.‘Our brands have been around for hundreds of years and play a special role in people’s lives as treats to be enjoyed in moderation.‘We want to support parents when they choose to give their children a treat and introducing this calorie cap will make it simpler for them to find a treat under 100 calories that children will enjoy.’         The new bars are slightly thinner (pictured top) and weigh less than the original. Cadbury\u0027s has said the price of the smaller bar will be similar to the regular version because it is \u0027more expensive to produce\u0027The move is aimed at bringing Cadbury’s confectionery in line with Public Health England’s advice that manufactured snacks and treats should contain no more than 100 calories, with children consuming no more than two a day.A spokesman added: ‘We hope that people recognise that our ultimate goal is to play our part in tackling childhood obesity and that we are doing this by focussing on the areas where we can make the biggest difference.‘Added to that, Public Health England’s Change 4 Life programme encourages a portion control approach, advising parents to look for 100-calorie snacks for their kids.’It is not the first time a chocolate company has claimed the reason it is shrinking products is to help combat obesity. As long ago as 2009, Mars in Australia ran a massive marketing campaign based on this theme to justify cutting the size of the Mars bar. At the time, politicians described the move, which saw no corresponding price cut, as underhand."},{"url":null,"title":"Cambridge student 19 jumped plane told parents worried university work","story":"Share this article          Investigators say tragic Alana opened the door to the out of the four-seater Cessna 182 (pictured) five minutes into the journey over Madagascar - just minutes after being given safety instructions on how to open the door in an emergency Local police Colonel D\u0027y La Paix Ralaivaonary said Ms Cutland had told her parents she was \u0027disappointed\u0027 and was frustrated by the research expedition. Studying natural sciences at Robinson College the successful student had shared her worries that the trip wouldn\u0027t have the research conclusion she was hoping for, just days after arriving, said Colonel D\u0027y La Paix Ralaivaonary to The BBC.Ms Cutland had arrived to take part in a research internship while on the African island just days before her death, the trip was expected to last six weeks. Flying to Madagascar on July 16 to study crabs in the Anjajavy area, Ms Cutland first appeared normal and in good spirits, according to staff at the luxury Anjajavy Le Lodge Hotelhotel.          Images taken by a Madagascan air rescue team who are currently searching forests and swamp land for the body of Alana Cutland          Alana was flying back from Anjajavy Le Lodge where she was staying in a remote area in the north of the island (pictured) to the capital where she was due to fly back to the UK at the request of her parents when she is said to have fallen illBut days later she began suffering from paranoid episodes, confusion and sleepless nights, even thinking that she could be jailed by Madagascar authorities if she failed in her crab research.Ms Cutland\u0027s parents Alison and Neil, 63, became so concerned that they arranged for her to cut short her 42 day trip and return home after just eight days.  While constantly contacting her parents throughout the brief trip she is also said to have expressed her \u0027anguish\u0027 and \u0027disappointment\u0027 at her predicted outcome of the research.The student also contacted her research supervisor several times, once on the second day of the trip and at least two more times after that.            Anjajavy village in northern Madagascar, where Miss Cutland stayed during her research trip to the country       Zebu cow believed to be sacrificed by villagers of Anjajavy village in northern Madagascar to aid the search for Alana Cutland, it will be taken to the airstrip tomorrow for the ceremonyToday the poverty-stricken villagers who have been searching for the body of Cambridge University student Alana Cutland turned to their local Malagasy religion for assistance - holding a cow sacrifice ceremony.Villagers were said to have been given new hope today after sacrificing one of their precious zebu cattle.More than 100 local people attended a ceremony this morning when the beast was killed on the remote airstrip where the tragic teenager boarded a four-seater Cessna 182 just minutes before she fell to her almost certain death.The villagers all stood in silence and turned to face the east in the traditional ceremony beside the runway so they could face the direction of the sunrise which represents the arrival of new life in Malagasy beliefs.They then set off to continue their search for the body of Alana, 19, before returning to remote Anjajavy village just before sunset to feast on a stew made from the meat of the 15-year-old female zebu which was called ‘Black and White’.

Historically, Harland \u0026amp Wolff had always maintained a predominantly Protestant workforce. Links between the yard, the Democratic Unionist Party and the Orange Order were strong, unambiguous and the source of frequent charges of sectarianism.For their part, Unionists pointed out that the workforce had also included Joe Cahill, a convicted murderer who went on to be the IRA’s chief of staff.The company was nationalised in 1977 and then returned to private hands in 1989 following its sale to a consortium made up of management, the workforce and Norway’s Fred Olsen shipping empire.With the largest dry dock in Europe, it focused on a new range of ships for the oil industry and the Royal Navy. However, it proved hard enough to compete with British rivals, let alone the wider world.         The two giant ‘H \u0026amp W’ yellow dockyard cranes — known as ‘Samson’ and ‘Goliath’ — may be to Belfast what the Eiffel Tower is to Paris. As of today, however, they merely serve as memorials to the days when the city was the engine room of the British Empire         The old shipyard district has been rebranded as ‘The Titanic Quarter’, complete with museum and packed waterfront restaurants. Thanks to the enduring appeal of the 1997 Hollywood blockbuster, the Titanic story continues to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. Workers are pictured beneath another shipIn 2000, H\u0026ampW pinned its hopes on the contract to build the new Queen Mary 2 for Cunard, only to lose out to the French.The last of more than 300 ships to bear the imprimatur of Harland \u0026amp Wolff was a roll-onroll-off ferry commissioned by the Ministry of Defence. Called the MV Anvil Point, it left the yard in 2003. The company continued to seek new contracts repairing other ships and servicing the increasingly lucrative renewable energy market.Last year, it was involved in assembling wind turbines for the North Sea. But it was not enough.Despite the latest demands for emergency government intervention, the gates have now closed.‘People will not be surprised but they will be wistful,’ says the Belfast-born historian and academic Lord Bew, 69, recalling that his parents were both GPs with thousands of their patients employed at the shipyard.‘When I was growing up, the very idea of Belfast without shipyards was unthinkable.’         The last of more than 300 ships to bear the imprimatur of Harland \u0026amp Wolff was a roll-onroll-off ferry commissioned by the Ministry of Defence. Social Democratic and Labour Party politicians are pictured along with union officials outside the shipyardIn his book, Auld Hands, former H\u0026ampW employee Tom Thompson recounts the lively culture of the shipyard and some of the famous people connected to it. The singer, Van Morrison, grew up in the shadow of Harland \u0026amp Wolff where his father, George, worked as an electrician.Our most famous flautist, Sir James Galway, is the son of an H\u0026ampW riveter, ‘Jimbo’ Galway, a well-known local musician in his day.Another riveter, Bob Bishop, was responsible for discovering a promising young Manchester United footballer called George Best.Ironically, despite the company’s many triumphs, it is Harland \u0026amp Wolff’s greatest disaster for which it is best remembered.The old shipyard district has been rebranded as ‘The Titanic Quarter’, complete with museum and packed waterfront restaurants.Thanks to the enduring appeal of the 1997 Hollywood blockbuster, the Titanic story continues to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.Last month, the city’s port and tourism authorities jointly pulled off one of the great public relations masterstrokes of modern times: opening a new purpose-built cruise ship terminal on a site dedicated to the worst cruise ship tragedy of all time.So, Harland \u0026amp Wolff may sadly be no more.

Many creative artists whose imaginations rebelled against the communist states of eastern Europe faded after their countries became democratic. Was the challenge of dissidence a spur to creativity? Or is capitalist democracy destructive in its own banal, populist way? The novels of Milan Kundera and films of Jan Švankmajer are examples of that lost urgency, and – in Švankmajer’s case – funding, after the fall of communism. So it’s heartening that Maurer, who spent much of her life making dissident art in a totalitarian state, has done her best work since that state collapsed.It’s worth looking at her artistic life backwards. Go right to the end of Tate Modern’s enlightening, and free, survey of her subversive career to be delighted by the paintings she does today. Maurer’s flights of colour include interleaving waves of blue, green and yellow, curves of red rushing towards blue and orange rectangles, and interlapping grids of too many colours to count. The most recent of these joyous paintings that spin off across walls and around corners as they defy the idea of a closed picture surface is dated 2016. Maurer, born in 1937 in Budapest, is in the swim of creativity today and producing paintings that are simultaneously installations, with hard, bright geometries knocked sideways by some crazy libertarian impulse.Not that her early experiments are ever less than intelligent. The birth of conceptual art in the late 1960s was inspired by mayhem on the streets. While 1968 saw revolutions in Paris and Prague, artists rejected the commodified art object and declared that art could be a walk, a verbal proposition, or in Maurer’s case, a paving stone. Her 1971 work What Can One Do with a Paving Stone? is a sequence of black and white photographs of her playing with a slab of stone on a river bank. She wraps it, unwraps it, cradles it and ties it up. Just as British artist Richard Long was making temporary arrangements of sticks and stones, Maurer used this found object to create an ephemeral interactive sculpture. But a paving stone is not a pile of pebbles. It was a symbol of revolution: paving stones were often ripped up and thrown in street protests.The Hungarian revolution against the Soviet-imposed regime in 1956 had been so brutally crushed that even in the 1970s it took courage to hint at rebellion. Maurer’s dissident art finds freedom in using unlikely materials in cussedly inidualist ways. To create her 1975 print Seven Foldings, she scratched and bent a metal printmaking plate then covered it in ink and printed from it. The image she made of this ruined object is a curiously beautiful veil of grey interrupted by slanting black bars.Maurer made her art with kitchen-table methods that rejected the system and refused to participate in it. Yet the results have a haunting, formal beauty. In her black and white films, she watches shadows on a cup, folds in cloth or spins her camera round her flat. The rudimentary methods produce elegant and witty results. You can see how this art grew out of resistance. To create beauty with a bit of wire or make a film in your kitchen is to win a secret space of freedom.The work that most vividly evokes that atmosphere of underground fun is Maurer’s 1977 piece Parallel Lines, Analyses. In two layers of photographs we see two photographers running along opposite balconies of a block of flats in Budapest, snapping each other as they go. It’s like a communist version of Ed Ruscha’s photobook Every Building on the Sunset Strip, except instead of motels and gas stations we see grey ranks of flats.As the cold war approached its close in the 1980s, and with travel between east and west easier, Maurer discovered a new way to be free. In 1983, she was commissioned to paint in a medieval tower in Buchberg in Austria. She invented what she calls “space paintings”, dynamic installations that are half way between canvas and mural – and she hasn’t looked back. The passion for geometric design and love of disorder that collide in her conceptual art are indulged with glorious energy in her paintings.In today’s anxious world, where even a museum on a Sunday afternoon is not a safe space, it’s a joy to see this optimistic art. You could almost come away with the idea that the world has got better, not worse, in recent decades."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10d22066e56658b64551259761bfedfe5c2c03a7/0_1820_3335_2000/master/3335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58ee1b02f959a7900b4551c731badced","title":"sohrab hura images of a violent new india nationalism the coast","story":"With his photographs of out-of-control hedonism, punch-ups and blood-letting rituals, Hura captures a nation in the grip of an angry new nationalism Sohrab Hura’s photobook, The Coast, begins with a fantastical short story written by him. It features Madhu, a woman whose head has been stolen by her obsessive lover. She is awaiting the arrival of “an idiot of a photographer” who wants to capture her and “all the wonderful and vicious things that happened along the Indian coastline”.The images that follow are indeed wonderful and vicious, almost hallucinatory in their intensity: lovers embrace, angry men come to blows, revellers are caught in closeup, eyes bloodshot, faces daubed with powdered paint, lips smeared with lipstick. Moments of violence are caught in the flashbulb’s glare: a machete drips blood on a bare foot, a man holds a brick above another man he has pinned to the pavement, a woman stares in terror at something – or someone – just out of the frame.Throughout, Hura merges the real and the fictional, the found and the constructed, his harsh, unforgiving flash illuminating what he calls “the loneliness and suspicion of the Indian night”. In its raw immediacy, the book reflects what he describes as “the non-aesthetic of so many of the images uploaded on social media, which has now become an aesthetic in itself”. The result is one of the most powerfully unsettling photobooks of the year.“Many of the images in the book are real,” he continues, “but I have messed around with them afterwards. I have also witnessed and tried to defuse real fights. So, some of it is theatre, some of it real-life drama. I’m playing with ideas of voyeurism and trust, manipulating the viewer. Nothing is definite, everything is raw and overwhelming. This is the image world we now live in.”The idiot photographer mocked by his character, Madhu – “Why on Earth would anybody waste time on something like this?” – is, of course Hura himself, but also, he tells me, the voyeuristic viewer. “In a way, I was tapping into the discomfort I was feeling both as a photographer wandering the streets at night, but also as someone immersed in the image language of social media – what is right, what is wrong, what is true, what is fake? We are all complicit in that blurring of boundaries, even if we are just looking.”In its iconoclastic way, Hura’s book also reflects the volatility of contemporary Indian society, the uneasy dynamic between the new entrepreneurial class who are driving the country’s rapidly growing economy, and a more traditional culture in which rigid ideas of faith, caste and political allegiance still hold sway and are increasingly given violent expression. Of late, he says, he has been attuned to “an increasing dissonance” in Indian politics and public debate.Since we spoke, that ethnic tension has escalated considerably with Modi’s Hindu-led nationalist government controversially revoking Kashmir’s special status, instigating a widespread security clampdown involving thousands of troops. A security order has been issued banning public meetings, rallies and movement, while access to the internet, the main means for activists to organise protests, has been cut off across the disputed Himalayan region where seven million people live. While Modi’s hardline supporters see the move as the righting of a historical wrong, Masood Khan, president of the Pakistan-controlled portion of Kashmir, has said it could lead to a war with Pakistan.Hura belongs to an emerging generation of young Indian photographers questioning the role of the image-maker in this shifting political and social culture. Given the times, has he received flak from critics for misrepresenting, or sensationalising, aspects of Indian life, its religious and cultural traditions? “Not really. Some people are shocked by the images, some taken aback in a good way. What I do is not documentary, more a kind of multi-layered storytelling that has its own almost allegorical truth embedded in it. I think most people get that.”Hura was born in a small town in West Bengal and now lives in New Delhi. He has a degree in economics and describes his upbringing as “privileged – like most Indian photographers”. Now an associate member of the renowned Magnum photographic agency, he has also taught workshops at Photo Katmandu in Nepal. He is self-taught having learned the basics, when he accompanied “ a proper photographer to shoot mountains and sunrises. They were nothing special, but it was the first time in a long time I felt good about myself.”Two of his earlier series, Life Is Elsewhere and Look It’s Getting Sunny Outside!!!, deal with his mother’s schizophrenia. The latter series, in particular, hints at the visceral thrust of The Coast, but is grounded by a more intimate, tenderly observed approach. “When my mother became ill,” he says, “it seemed like the end of my world.”The Coast marks a distinct shift in approach and attitude insofar as it utterly disregards the conventions of traditional documentary photography. Often, intentionally, it is hard to read what exactly is going on in a single photograph, the uncertainty amplified by Hura’s repeated use of the same image, but in often jarring juxtapositions. As the visual narrative moves outward from a makeshift bedroom into the uncertain world beyond, we witness religious rituals that involve demonic masquerade and blood-letting as well as glimpses of the destitute, the physically deformed and the mentally anguished. The book culminates with a series of calmer images of people, often fully clothed, plunging into the ocean as if surrendering to its elemental power.“I shot many of those images in a village by the sea in Tamil Nadu during a religious festivity which was quite wild and aggressive. Many people seemed to have entered into a state of trance. They were masquerading as gods, as doctors, patients, the poor and the crazy. There were people wrapped in bandages with blood dripping from them. I saw others who had entered a state of frenzied violence, plunging themselves into the waves to wash away their masks, banish their demons. It was a ritual cleansing, a letting go – of fear, aggression, anxiety.”For all that, The Coast is restrained compared to the work that prefigured it: The Lost Head \u0026amp the Bird, a disorienting projection that unfolds at disorienting speed against a loud, industrial soundtrack. I first experienced it in a darkened room in Peckham in 2017, describing it then as “an almost subliminal flow of often violent images that is like a jolt to the senses compared to the prints-on-the-wall traditionalism of most exhibitions”. Hura tells me that there are now 12 different versions of the projection that play on a loop, describing the extended remix as “a vessel of infinity and randomness, history and absurdism wherein there is no one fixed truth”.The book is more considered but equally experimental – it concludes with 11 versions of the aforementioned short story, each one differing from the others in just a few carefully altered words. “In India, perhaps more so than anywhere else, fiction, stories, myths live longer than factual stories.” Hura elaborates: “They are allegories that people return to, constants in the ongoing turbulence of politics, religion and caste. For me, the notion of photography as fiction is a given.”In his self-created persona – “the idiot photographer” – he creates images and narratives that are ambiguous, unreliable and open-ended, reflecting the anxious instability of our times. “My images are not dogmatic, they always carry an element of doubt,” he says. “I am trying to find my own place in this complicated shifting ecosystem of representation that is so huge now that it is hard to know what the parameters are. Within that, the only person I can take responsibility for is myself. Not Indians, not men. Just me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e31ed468859d6ed3d6a9c9f1aea06ed05cb9da78/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d29f3eb8777a3f019f865269fbc0594d","title":"monzo urges 480000 customers to change their pin numbers","story":"Digital bank says ‘bug’ meant unauthorised staff had access to numbers for six monthsThe digital bank Monzo has urged nearly 480,000 customers to change their pins after it left banking information exposed to unauthorised staff for six months.The bank, which is now valued at £2bn, said it usually stored pin records in a “particularly secure” part of its internal system where it could tightly control which staff members could access them. But on Friday, the bank discovered that pins were also being copied on to log files, that while encrypted, could be accessed by about 110 unauthorised engineers. understands that pins were mis-stored for up to six months, and that the situation has since been reported to the Information Commissioner’s Office as a precaution.About one in five of the bank’s 2.6 million customers, or around 480,000 UK accounts, have been affected.Monzo pushed ahead with an app upgrade early on Saturday morning after discovering the flaw, and worked throughout the weekend to delete the information it had incorrectly stored. That process was completed on Monday.Monzo insisted that no one outside the bank had access to the pins and said it had no evidence suggesting the data was misused.“We’ve checked all the accounts that have been affected by this bug thoroughly, and confirmed the information hasn’t been used to commit fraud,” Monzo said in a blogpost.“Just in case, we’ve messaged everyone that’s been affected to let them know they should change their pin by going to a cash machine.”The bank also sent emails to potentially affected customers on Monday, apologising for having mismanaged the sensitive data. While the issue is said to have been resolved, it is one of the worst IT problems to hit the app-only bank since its launch in 2015.Last week Monzo was affected by a temporary outage that meant some card purchases were failing to go through. Others were unable to login or receive bank transfers.The brand, known for its hot coral pink cards, is particularly popular among millennials in the south-east but is quickly spreading across the UK. With plans to expand to the US its chief executive, Tom Blomfield, expects the bank to grow to 3 million customers in a matter of months.Blomfield’s growth plans have been fuelled by a fresh round of funding announced in June, which helped Monzo double in value to £2bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f4696ba75109387739653453622c6020f7c4cf/0_325_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0906e96c8ae93db1d3643e3d89bbca6e","title":"london is increasingly home to the top 1 by income study finds","story":"Highest earners in the country overwhelmingly middle-aged men living in the south-eastRobert Joyce, deputy director at the IFS, said: “This geographic and demographic concentration may be one reason why many of those on high incomes don’t realise quite how much higher their incomes are than the average.”The findings come amid growing concerns over the rise of inequality in Britain over recent decades.

There’s hope that the constitutional atrocities planned by the prime minister and Downing Street’s ‘dark lord’, Dominic Cummings, can and will be prevented by good MPs who will put saving the country ahead of their party.Most of these will be Labour, Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru, Green, Change UK and stray independents. But noblest of all will be Conservative MPs who, like the burghers of Calais (whose memorial they pass every day), will sacrifice their careers for the good of all. No “golden age” awaits Johnson: he will be hoist on his own outrageous hubris.“The majority in parliament against no deal is bigger and more resolute than ever,” says the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer. The Tory rebels agree. They are aghast at the arrogant strutting of Cummings who is, says one, the best recruiting sergeant for rebellion on the Tory backbenches. The No 10 supremo’s careless contempt affronts many Tory MPs – and he is defiantly in contempt of parliament. The cabinet of sycophants, signed up to no deal in blood to get their jobs, are told to say nothing without permission from No 10 – that is, Cummings.He orders myriad extra new special advisers to see that ministers say and do nothing without his consent, as he will “take no shit from ministers” who have “got to learn it’s in their self-interest to do what they are told”, the Sunday Times reports. “No one is indispensable” the cabinet has been told. “Don’t speak if you have nothing interesting to say,” Boris Johnson is said to have warned the 33 obedients round his table. How’s this for their powerless subservience? They do not discuss Brexit, which is left entirely to the “war cabinet” of six ministers in the Cobra room of the Cabinet Office, signalling the future chaos. The idea that Johnson, of all ill-disciplined politicians, can impose this omerta for long, let alone zip his own lips, is improbable. How much time before the cabinet of sheep start baaing? The insult to their amour propre already has many Tory MPs bristling at this ferocious upstart, only two weeks into the new regime.The fight is on. MPs will struggle to stop a no-deal Brexit by seizing control of the parliamentary timetable, but Johnson has refused to rule out proroguing parliament to prevent them. Returning on 3 September, Labour will call a vote of no confidence in the Johnson government, and this will be the moment of truth: are there enough burghers of Calais on the Tory benches? Rebels reckon there could be 30 or 40. Assuming only a Kate Hoey or two on Labour’s side fails to back it, there are 14 days in which Johnson, still prime minister, tries and fails to form a government. He is legally obliged to call an election, but Cummings said over the weekend the date would be set for after 31 October, Brexit day. The country will crash out without a vote, legal but outrageous. The only way that can be prevented is by a manoeuvre itself so outrageous it makes you gasp to contemplate it. Anti-no-dealers would set up a temporary government of national unity to outvote Johnson.The only purpose of this “government” would be to ask the EU for a delay, to conduct a referendum and a general election. Let the people decide, that would be its sole purpose. Who would be the interim prime minister? It would need someone from Labour, since the plan relies on Labour to make it happen. Let it not be an active player in future leadership or government, but a statesperson respected on all sides who would be no future threat to anyone. Rebel Tories suggest several names, but one stands out: Margaret Beckett, a previous interim Labour leader, who would be trusted to do only what the crisis demands – call an election and a referendum.This is no centrist party stalking horse, but purely a mechanism to ensure the country does not crash out of the EU without a deal unless the people actively vote for it. No deal was not even mentioned as an option in the referendum, where staying in the single market and customs union were regularly promised by Brexiteers.What seems likely is that Johnson and Cummings are planning to frame a future election as a fight between themselves as “the people”, with MPs usurpers of the people’s will. The opposite is the case. As no deal doesn’t have majority support, they would struggle throughout a long campaign to explain why they were denying both the people and MPs a vote.Social democrats are quick to despair when faced with full-frontal assault by the right. They are deemed too subtle, not assertive enough. But this Boris boosterism is all bogus. Look what a signally disastrous start he has made in just two weeks: the pound plunged and the shine came off his electoral magic when he lost a byelection in a Tory seat. His polling bounce has been relatively modest. His £100m spend on ads to “prepare” the public for no-deal Brexit will spark the panic buying it’s supposed to prevent. Overhyping his spending spree on the NHS and police makes some suspicious of his fiscal trustworthiness, while others plainly see that it’s only a pittance against the breaking dam of public service impoverishment.Now consider the insanity of the Cummings plan. He wants to crash out of the EU mid-election campaign, with lorry queues, food and medicine shortages, and goodness knows what unforeseen crises as the EU turns its back on us and our £39bn unpaid debt. Really? If this disaster can’t be prevented well then bring it on, and let’s see the Tories render themselves unelectable for a generation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2720dafba4a8fc28c583b9755570880f309b5803/0_90_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3af43a9ede89df129a6eee7c33430ccc","title":"whaley bridge dam very nearly went","story":"Effort to stop 1.2m tonnes of water flooding town began with one man desperately trying to lower the water levelLast Thursday, as water rushed over the dam wall holding back the Toddbrook reservoir, a lone Canal \u0026amp River Trust employee fought against the deluge, desperately trying to lower the water level.Heavy rain had led to an excess of water cascading over the spillway above the town of Whaley Bridge in the Peak District. This would not normally be an issue, but as the torrent continued the spillway started to erode and concrete ballasts began to rip away.Barry Rudd, a volunteer with the trust, said he arrived at the dam at midday to find the employee, who has not been named “desperately trying to reduce the levels by opening the valves. He was running up and down the reservoir with a rake clearing debris and adjusting and tracking the valves but there was just so much water coming over the top it began to wash away the clay wall.”As it became apparent that 1.2m tonnes of water could engulf schools, homes and businesses in the town below, the manager of the local bowling club, who has a direct view of the dam from his home, raised the alarm and police officers and firefighters raced to the reservoir.Engineers were soon on the scene and Toddbrook sailing club quickly became a temporary command centre. Drone footage was examined and just a few hours after the leaks were spotted, thousands of residents were evacuated from their homes.On Monday – speaking four days after the evacuation – Gavin Tomlinson, the fire incident commander, said it had been a near miss.He said: “On Thursday night it very nearly went. It was leaking and we were in a situation where we had five times as much water going in than we could take out. We absolutely thought it could fail. It was a very, very tense night.”As residents were evacuated an RAF Chinook helicopter was drafted in and began to drop hundreds of bags of sand and aggregate to shore up the slipped pieces of concrete.Since then seven tonnes of water a minute have been pumped out of the structure, built in 1831, drastically lowering the threat of flooding across the valley down towards the towns and villages of the High Peak.On a whiteboard Terry McDermott, Derbyshire’s chief fire officer, explained the operation, drawing an aerial picture of the dam, highlighting the point in the sluice channel where the water had to be let out.With only one pump available in those first crucial hours, rescue workers had to scramble to get dozens more. Meanwhile, a local civil engineering company hurriedly built a temporary road around the reservoir so they could move the pumps from the dam’s north to the south.The Chinook dropped more than 1,000 sandbags and 600 bags of aggregate to plug the hole, then concrete was poured in to seal the gap. Once the water levels had begun to drop ers were sent in to place steel tubes directing water into the channel.So far 11 steel pipe hoses, 500ft long and 12 inches in diameter, have been built into the reservoir’s edge, allowing workers to pump out about 700,000 tonnes of water in four days. Boat crews were sent in to clear debris and weeds clogging up the pipes and as water levels continued to fall, workers built floating platforms to take pumps further into the reservoir.Tomlinson said the reservoir level was now five metres below normal and workers would continue to pump out water until it fell eight metres, allowing for engineers to inspect the damage.It is understood it could take up to a year for the dam to be fully repaired and locals have begun to question whether it was properly maintained.But for now McDermott, Tomlinson and their teams are breathing a sigh of relief. “We have worked every hour since it started and only today have we started to feel like we are over the worst of it,” Tomlinson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dabe45c1a6111a2988c68d659979d09d20af456a/0_129_6474_3884/master/6474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df1b5d6918e1c3dd01551f573da37850","title":"rachel roddy cannoli recipe","story":"The perennial Sicilian favourite confection, the recipe straight from the kitchen of one of the masters of the artI have written about Sandro Pace before his progress from 11-year-old bar boy (to keep him out of trouble) to 17-year-old owner of bar Corallo his training as a pastry chef in Ragusa then return to Comiso to open Cantunéra. I have written about his exceptional arancine, but this time I have come for cannoli.The name cannolo comes from canna, the short length of cane the dough was traditionally wrapped around to form a tube, which was then fried and filled with sweetened ricotta. Apparently, cannoli evolved during Sicily’s Arab occupation, in a harem in Qal‘at al-Nisa (now Caltanissetta) where women made Roman carnival sweets their own, with phallic implications. The Arab domination ended, but cannoli did not. Not averse to certain habits, Christian nuns adopted the tradition of cannoli, which in time became ubiquitous in Sicily and beyond.There are various well-known dramatic scenes in which cannoli play a part, the most poignant being in an episode of Sicily’s greatest and grouchiest Inspector Montalbano. Specially written after the death of actor Marcello Perracchio, who played doctor Pasquano for 15 years, the scene is set after the funeral: Montalbano calls colleagues into his office and hands each of them a cannolo. They eat in silence, an edible last curtain call to the cannoli-loving doctor and much-loved actor. It is a scene with new significance following the death of Montalbano’s writer Andrea Camilleri sweetness as consolation. My Sicilian partner remembers cannoli from childhood, and packs of coffee being brought around during periods of mourning, when the body would be in the living room and everyone sat around eating cannoli and weeping.Back at Cantunéra, Sandro credits signor Marino, a granita maker, as the person who taught him to value the best ingredients. He is visibly distressed as he tells us about what he sees as the lack of care and respect for ingredients many bars and restaurants in Sicily seem to have, and their resistance to change. He says he owes his skill and dedication to a rigorous training under Gino Malandrino in Ragusa his kitchen is immaculate, with everything laid out ready to show me. He proudly reminds me that this is his own recipe for cannoli, and that there are many.Never buy a cannoli that’s been sitting ready-filled is Sandro’s advice. The tubes should be piped full of sweetened ricotta for each customer on demand, otherwise they get soggy. Both ends of the tube are then dipped in ground pistachios and decorated with a curl of candied orange or some red or blackcurrants.There are a few seats inside Cantunéra, but the best ones are on the pavement opposite. The impossible heat of the day has been replaced by a flirty breeze. While we sit, someone parks a car in an impossibly small space. Sandro’s cannoli don’t so much crunch as shatter between your teeth, giving way to the filling. It’s rich not just with ricotta and sugar, but with celebration, sex, abstinence, detectives and writers, life and death. In short, it’s sublime. We eat in silence.You will need 10-12 cannoli tubes, and ideally a pasta rolling machine.500g 00 flour50g butter50g caster sugar7g salt150ml red wine (ideally syrah)50ml rum1 orange, zested1 pinch cinnamon1 egg, beatenSunflower or peanut oil, for fryingFor the filling500g ricotta125g icing sugarCandied orange peel, for decoratingPistachios, finely chopped, for decoratingPut the flour, butter, sugar and salt in the bowl of a mixer and turn it on. As the mixer runs, add the wine, rum, zest and cinnamon, then let it continue mixing for 10 minutes. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and chill for six hours. Using a pasta machine on the second-to-thinnest setting, roll the dough through and lay it on a floured board. Using a five-inch (about 12cm) cutter, cut it into rounds, then wrap each one around a cannoli tube. Seal with a dab of beaten egg.Bring a pan of sunflower or peanut oil to 180C. Lower the tubes into the oil a few at a time and nudge them around until they’re golden and erupt into bubbles – 60-90 seconds. Lift them out and blot on kitchen paper. Once cool, slide the cannoli off the tubes.Mix the sieved ricotta and icing sugar, then scrape into a piping bag. When it is time to eat, pipe the filling into the tubes, then dip each end in the chopped pistachios and decorate with a curl of candied orange."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a65cb4eb60c9cc7a3b0858377372351599ec0d49/0_609_3530_2119/master/3530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9c287d7763ff0131de9090983b85ee1","title":"what spuds do you like tell us about your favourite baked potatoes","story":"After jacket potato chain Spudulike closed its last branches, we want to hear about your favourite jacket potatoes fillings – and what you love about the foodOn Friday baked potato chain Spudulike announced they had become the latest casualty of the British high street, with all 37 of their UK stores closing down.

On Monday, the master of negotiation completed the deal, paying £80m finally to secure the centre-back six days before Manchester United’s first game of the season.Perhaps such mockery is a little unfair, given interest from Manchester City did threaten briefly to push up the price – but only a little. United have got their man but they would have been far better off getting him earlier so he could have a full pre-season, sweating his way through Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s taxing new fitness regimen and learning what it is to play alongside Chris Smalling. Beyond that, though, this seems like a move that makes a lot of sense.At times towards the end of last season United fielded a back four comprising only players who had been at the club in Alex Ferguson’s time. They desperately needed to refresh their defence. Their board also seems to have made a decision at some point to focus on young players with Premier League experience but who are on the way up, rather than paying huge sums for pre-formed stars such as Alexis Sánchez and Paul Pogba.Maguire fulfils the first criterion and just about answers the second. At 26 and with 20 caps, he is coming close to full maturity but is perhaps not quite there yet. And it is easy to see why Solskjær should have been so keen to sign him, why he did not want to turn to other options such as Toby Alderweireld or Kalidou Koulibaly.It is not just that Maguire is an excellent defender, big and strong and good in the air. Or that he is adept at carrying the ball out from the back. Or even that he prefers to operate as the left of the two central defenders, unlike anybody else in the United squad other than Marcos Rojo. It is the sense of control and authority he exudes. Even if he does not wear the armband Maguire is a leader, and this is a defence that in recent years has desperately needed leadership.The fee has raised eyebrows, particularly when Alderweireld was available for £25m, and breaking the world record for a defender is not something United will have done lightly. It may also be noted that United’s four costliest signings are now more expensive than City’s record (based on the euro value at the time of the deal). This is a perpetual problem for Woodward: everything he does looks ham-fisted by comparison with City who, whatever qualms there may be about the source of their immense wealth, have invested it with almost superhuman acuity.But £80m is perhaps not so unreasonable. The record for the most expensive defender before Maguire was held by Virgil van Dijk who cost Liverpool £75m when, after a protracted pursuit, they signed him from Southampton in January 2018. Van Dijk has excelled and his value now would be significantly in excess of that. Nobody could seriously dispute that, at least within the inflated world of modern transfer fees, he has been worth every penny.Just because one expensive defender turned out to be worth the money, of course, does not mean that a slightly more expensive one will be. Nor is it the case that just because Liverpool were right to ignore other options to get their first choice United will equally be vindicated. But it is the case that the Van Dijk deal set a marker for a gifted centre-back just approaching the peak of his development.United, presumably, hope that Maguire can have the same impact for them that Van Dijk has had for Liverpool and, that being so, it is not unreasonable that they should pay a similar fee.But ultimately, all talk of the fee is fluff. If Maguire prospers, United could have paid double what they have and only accountants and financial fair play inspectors would care. If he fails, they could have paid half what they have and it would still seem disastrous. Maguire would seem to have all the attributes to be a success, but the bigger issue is the situation he is going into. Victor Lindelöf and, to a lesser extent, Eric Bailly arrived at Old Trafford with big reputations and struggled.The evidence of pre-season is that Solskjær wants to press and operate with a high line, which given Maguire is a little cumbersome on the turn is an immediate concern. Perhaps his positional sense will be enough to ensure that is not a problem but that then requires a good understanding with whoever plays at the back of midfield – on the evidence of pre-season, probably Nemanja Matic and Scott McTominay – an area in which United’s squad remains light.An understanding, of course, would have been rather easier to forge with a full pre-season. What that is worth is almost impossible to evaluate, but if a lack of understanding at the back costs United on Sunday against Chelsea, direct rivals for Champions League qualification, the odd £5m here or there might not seem too consequential. United may have got the right man but you cannot help but wonder why it took them so long to do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0fef080be7b42d33928ebc64e777cfba30edd6c/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6e66c1990d250253f45ac8b377ab297","title":"virgil van dijk harry maguire record price pressure","story":"• Manchester United’s new man world’s most expensive defender• Liverpool’s Van Dijk was previous holder after move in 2018Virgil van Dijk has warned Harry Maguire that his new status as the world’s most expensive defender will increase the weight on his shoulders but urged Manchester United’s new signing to do his talking on the pitch.Van Dijk’s £75m move from Southampton last January set a benchmark for defensive players until Maguire’s £80m switch to Old Trafford was confirmed five days before the start of the new Premier League season. The 26-year-old is expected to feature in Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s squad for the trip to Chelsea on Sunday and Van Dijk – who was voted as PFA Player of the Year last season as he helped Jürgen Klopp’s side to win the Champions League – insists he bears no grudges after being overtaken by the England defender.“Good luck to him,” he said. “I can’t say anything about that because there was always going to be a time when it was going to change. That’s the market. He doesn’t have any influence on that but I wish him well. The price comes with pressure but it doesn’t change too much because you always have pressure at big clubs like Man United. But I wish him well.”Asked how he coped with the pressure of such a high price tag, Van Dijk said: “Just focus on doing what you love to do and play your best game. Get your qualities out of the pitch, enjoy your game and don’t think about the other things. It is not easy to completely shut off all the pressure. Personally, I like to put things in perspective. Quite a lot of things are more important than playing football and what we do, we are blessed. We can do what we love to do and also to play for Liverpool – they are such a big club. You need to enjoy it but the pressure will always be there.”Having missed out on the Premier League title last season by one point to Manchester City, next year marks the 30th anniversary of Liverpool’s last championship under Kenny Dalglish in 1990. Yet while Van Dijk admitted the experience of beating Tottenham in the Champions League final has boosted the confidence of Klopp’s side, he acknowledged that it will count for nothing when the new season begins at home to the newly promoted Norwich on Friday night.“We have spoken about a lot of things, but the main thing is that we are starting over,” he said. “Last year was last year. Everybody was still enjoying having won the Champions League when we came back, but straight away it was down to playing again, and starting from scratch. Well, not completely from scratch, but it was time to start to get back to work and making sure he got the most from us.“We want to compete in all competitions. It is something we aim for. We won the Champions League last year but if you look at the other competitions we played we did not do too great. We are going to give it a go and try to get as far as possible in all of the competitions and everybody starting each competition will be trying their hardest.”Van Dijk added: “The traditional top six all want to win the Premier League and so do we. Last year we were close and we are going to try again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2640b2352c18a3e75c8fe111e30a4519428c0dc6/0_276_4542_2725/master/4542.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeb7d9e2079daa312d7a9df9afc767b0","title":"wayne rooney derby county talks player coach huddersfield","story":"Derby County have held talks with the former England captain Wayne Rooney over a potential player-coach role. The 33-year-old still has more than two seasons left on his DC United contract but Derby’s owner, Mel Morris, believes Rooney could inspire a squad which went so close to promotion under Frank Lampard last season.Derby appointed the former Barcelona midfielder Phillip Cocu as manager last month on a four-year contract following Lampard’s move to Chelsea.Initial talks between Derby and Rooney’s agent, Paul Stretford, have taken place and Morris is expecting more discussions in the near future.The former Everton and Manchester United striker, who is England’s all-time record scorer with 53 goals in 120 appearances for his country, has made little secret of his desire to move into management and would be keen on a return to England.“I’m taking the steps to get my badges completed and when I finish playing I’ll see what opportunities come up,” Rooney said.“There’s already offers which have been made, but at the minute I’m still a player and I want to enjoy playing, and then I’ll see which offers are right when I do finish.”Asked if he had been contacted by clubs from England or the United States, he added: “Yeah, both. There’s an opportunity for me to go into management straight away and when I do hang my boots up, that decision will be made on what the ambition of the club is first of all, and what my ambitions are and what’s right for both myself and that particular team.”Derby won 2-1 at Huddersfield in their opening Championship fixture on Monday evening. Two first-half goals from Tom Lawrence ultimately proved enough despite a Karlan Grant penalty for the hosts. The result meant that for the first time, all three sides that were relegated from the Premier League the previous season lost their opening Championship games.Lawrence’s first came after an unfortunate defensive error from home debutant Tommy Elphick, but he deserved full credit for his second – a well-taken effort from the edge of the box.Kieran Dowell’s clumsy challenge on Juninho Bacuna in the penalty area opened the door for Grant – the Terriers’ top scorer last season with only four goals – to reduce Derby’s lead from the spot.Cocu, speaking after the Huddersfield win, said of Rooney: “At the moment I can’t say anything. We’re working on completing the team and I cannot say anything about names before things are done.“We have a lot of players who could be an asset for the team. You always try to get the best you can with the resources available at the club.“A few more days and hopefully I can tell you something more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d7169716497b81ad30c7c22a45bb478ffc3fb75/282_57_2112_1267/master/2112.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=860fa676604aff3387fee4768c40ba2b","title":"nigeria metoo moment accuser busola dakolo","story":"Busola Dakolo investigated by police after publicly acusing star pastor Biodun FatoyinboBusola Dakolo said she had been expecting to hear from the police. Three weeks earlier the photographer had filed a case against the flamboyant Nigerian celebrity pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo, accusing him of raping her years before.However, she recalled that the silver Toyota that tailed her as she was driving into her Lagos housing estate, and the white minibus with tinted windows already parked outside her house, had no police markings. By the time she got to her gate, the minibus had blocked her path. According to Dakolo, a man appeared and told her to get out of the car, get into the bus and speak to his oga – Nigerian pidgin English for boss.Dakolo said when she refused, three men got out of the minibus and walked towards her.The letter contained allegations of criminal conspiracy, falsehood, mischief and threat to life. These were not levelled against Fatoyinbo, however, but against Dakolo and her husband, a well-known musician.Dakolo’s description of the two occasions on which Fatoyinbo allegedly raped her, first at her family home and then on the bonnet of his car, shocked Nigerians. It also triggered a backlash both from the pastor himself – he denies the allegations “in every measure” – and from some of the 16,000 members of his church, the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (Coza).Dakolo had been hailed as a brave survivor whose speaking out, women’s rights activists hoped, could set off a #MeToo movement in the west African country where patriarchal traditions continue to stigmatise survivors. Now she found herself hounded in a seemingly orchestrated social media campaign.“Busola Dakolo was never raped nor had any form of intercourse with Biodun Fatoyinbo. She fabricated the entire story to garner sympathy for a bigger assignment of defamation,” wrote the controversial blogger Kemi Omololu-Olunloyo, who describes herself as “the Great Journalist of Nigeria”. Later, she posted: “Busola Dakolo should exit this web of lies now. There was NO RAPE!”“If God be for him, even all the celebrities, everyone that has made comments, even the over two million followers on Instablog can’t bring him down,” Ernest Esekhile, a Christian DJ, said on Instagram.The charges against the Dakolos were brought by a special police branch in a counter-case filed by Coza, despite investigations stalling on the initial case.“Our culture doesn’t allow speaking of these sorts of things against anointed men of God,” Dakolo said. “They’d rather hide it, and the party that is being victimised tends to live with that self-blame. The damage on the survivor is extremely terrible. The society, the church, keeps sweeping things under the carpet.”Fatoyinbo returned to the pulpit on Sunday after a month’s absence. “As a Christian, you must face opposition. If God, who is holy and faithful, has enemies, you are sure going to have,” he told the congregation.Pastors are often revered in Nigerian society, some leading church franchises with branches worldwide and congregations in the tens of thousands, building hangar-size places of worship and flying around in private jets. Fatoyinbo himself drives a Porsche.They often also wield significant political power: TB Joshua, the leader of the Synagogue, Church of All Nations, has received presidents from across the continent, and sometimes makes prophecies about who will win elections – including one that Hillary Clinton would win in 2016. Chris Okotie, a 1980s pop star turned pastor, has run for president himself four times.The country’s vice-president is a pastor at the Redeemed Christian Church of God, the country’s most economically and politically important religious institution, according to the sociologist Ebenezer Obadare. In response to condemnation of the delivery of the Dakolos’ letters, the Nigerian police force put out a statement saying: “A police invitation letter is not synonymous with a warrant of arrest, and must not be construed to be one. Rather, it is a polite investigative tool used in eliciting information voluntarily from parties to aid police investigations.”However, Dakolo said it was “extremely intimidating” to have a gunman emerge from a darkened minibus, and that while she had eventually acquiesced, she had been in shock.“Is this what everybody goes through, everyone that comes out to say their truth, everybody that says something about someone that is influential?” she asked. “I felt: who’s going to be there for the common man? Who is going to be there for someone who nobody knows?”The lawyer and women’s rights advocate Ayisha Osori said Nigeria had “a very strong rape culture” and that men and the state felt a sense of entitlement to women’s bodies. “That’s why the state doesn’t typically play a supportive role, but instead plays a role to maintain power structures,” she said.Osori said that if it was not quite Nigeria’s #MeToo moment yet, it was a “huge deal” to have an educated, public-facing woman speak out, with a supportive spouse alongside her, and would be looked back on as a milestone.“It’s not done for women who have everything to lose to come out and say: ‘This has happened to me.’ That a middle-class family, a well-known family responds as they do – it’s extremely positive.”She said she was praying for justice and she hoped it would encourage others to come forward.“This issue is beyond me. This is what’s happening, and the church is a place where they don’t talk about this.“I decided to come out for me,” she added. “It’s for me and others, so they can begin their process of healing, so they can begin to live freely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7580dc07095d208e89d7bffef935317b0710392/0_464_5100_3061/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d1d0f22b061325b2ba93549deaa29d","title":"how to eat on a first date to make sure you get a second one","story":"Avoid stringy food, be polite to the waiter – and don’t mock your date’s pronunciation of ‘quinoa’What are the secrets to a successful dinner date? For an activity that, in basic terms, involves little more than sitting down to a meal and not mentioning your ex, there is a surprisingly extensive list of dos and don’ts.“Never. Order. Spaghetti,” says my boyfriend’s mum, in the sort of tone you might reserve for a conversation with an the undertaker. “Plan conversation topics in advance,” screeches the part of my brain forever warped by 00s teen magazines’ edicts on “how to talk to lads”.But there is more to impressing over dinner than forgoing your final churro. (Indeed, endearing yourself to someone to the point that you are offered said churro is a feat of seduction in itself.)There is choosing the right food, for a start. This is no mere case of picking whatever is most tempting from the menu several staples seem to be on a kind of universal dating blacklist. Most obvious is the aforementioned spaghetti, which few can pull off like the leads in Lady and the Tramp. Love coach Persia Lawson warns against “any sort of stringy food” after an unfortunate first date during which she almost choked on a piece of Parma ham. “It got lodged down my throat and I had to pull it out. It was so gross.” One friend tells a cautionary tale about mackerel: those hairy little bones really cleave to the canines, apparently.In short, especially challenging food is best avoided – but don’t feel as though you have to abide by arbitrary bans, says Olivia Potts, a cook and author of A Half Baked Idea. “The old cliche of not ordering garlic on a date is a bit outdated now,” she says. “Just make sure your date indulges as much as you do, and you’ll be A-OK.”Besides, most people agree that a date’s behaviour is more important than what they order or how they eat it. From personal experience, I suggest refraining from taking someone to the cafe where you passed many happy moments in your last relationship (“Jen loved the carrot cake,” is not a phrase Gwen wants to hear) or trying to assert your metropolitan foodie status by mocking your companion’s pronunciation of “quinoa”. And unless you know – and by that I mean you have proved beyond reasonable doubt, in a way that would stand up in court – that your date shares your interest in wine, refrain from droning on about the list. It will bring to mind Jacob Rees-Mogg filibustering in the Commons. And this is not a sexy vibe.The verdict is mixed on how much table manners matter. Somewhat predictably, William Hanson, an etiquette coach and co-host of the Help I Sexted My Boss podcast, holds them in high regard. “In the west, our eating implements are knives, forks and spoons. If they can’t deftly handle the cutlery they have used since their childhood, then I would raise an eyebrow.” But Potts says a lack of table manners “doesn’t mark out a bad person – or a bad partner”. A better indication of character, she says, is how they treat the staff. “Never sleep with someone who’s rude to a waiter, for God’s sake.”My own manners are dubious. I hold my knife and fork in the “wrong” hands and regularly bring along my own water bottle, suggesting offputtingly Gwyneth Paltrow levels of H2O devotion. But I would argue that pointing out someone’s poor table manners is more frightful than simply exhibiting them – I’m looking at you, old flame who instructed me to start holding my fork in my left hand so as not to “upset” his family. Far better to focus on conversation than cutlery usage – though, on this note, mind that you’re not nattering so intently in the first 10 minutes of meeting that the waiters give up on you. Yes, you have made a vivacious first impression, but you are now starving and forced to observe a tense 20-minute silence while you attempt to flag someone down to belatedly place your order.And now to the issue that befuddles even the canniest of daters: the bill. In 2019, women have jobs and their own money, which means it is frankly preposterous to cleave to the embarrassingly patriarchal and heteronormative notion that the man should pay. But while the breakdown of traditional etiquette is good for equality, no new rubric has taken its place, which can be confusing. Fresh guidelines are required if we don’t want to end the night with a boring discussion of finances. Hanson has a suggestion. “Whoever initiated the date pays – whether that is a man or woman, whether the other one on the date is of the same or different gender,” he says. “Only split the bill if it was a terrible date and there is zero chance of another one happening.”So what if it is not your first date, but your 101st? Can you let standards slip if you’re dining with a long-term partner? I put this query to the relationship therapist Val Sampson, thinking of my tendency to denude my boyfriend’s pizzas of their olives when he’s in the loo. “Just because you’re a long way down the line doesn’t mean you don’t have to bring your best self,” she says. “This is the person you’re meant to care about most in the world.” I am momentarily chastened. But unfortunately, my best self just really likes olives.Ultimately, the rules about eating on dates have not changed: even if you’re generous with your chips, a host of other pitfalls could ruin the romance. Being kind and interested is more important than wielding cutlery correctly and choosing the right restaurant. Reassuring, eh? Except, of course, if you’re strong on etiquette but low in humanity. But then you can look at it another way: if you don’t want to admit to being terrible company, you can always blame your choice of spaghetti."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42a693ab5c57834135940df1832569ae3d15b137/620_271_2576_1546/master/2576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fc00cfa19453c919bf45a1844c87330","title":"i dont smell meet the people who have stopped washing","story":"A growing number of people are eschewing soap and trusting bacteria to do the job instead – and an entire industry has sprung up to accommodate themDavid Whitlock has not showered or bathed for 15 years, yet he does not have body odour. “It was kind of strange for the first few months, but after that I stopped missing it,” he says. “If I get a specific part of my body dirty, then I’ll wash that specific part” – but never with soap. As well as germs, soap gets rid of the skin’s protective oils and alters its pH level. Although Whitlock appreciated gaining an extra 15 minutes a day from soap-dodging, his primary motivation was to encourage friendly microbes to live on him in symbiotic harmony. The bacteria get to feast on the ammonia from his sweat and he gets low-maintenance, balanced skin.Just as awareness of the importance of the gut microbiome has led to a boom in probiotic and fermented foods and supplements, there is increasing interest in our skin microbiome: the trillions of microbes that protect us from pathogens and keep us healthy by making vitamins and other useful chemicals. In this unprecedentedly sanitised era, in which eczema, acne and problems associated with dry skin are rife, consumers are hungry for solutions. Even the mainstream brand Dove claims vaguely that its products are “microbiome-gentle”.Sarah Ballantyne, a medical biophysicist turned author and lifestyle guru known as the Paleo Mom, has been an advocate of living in a more “stone age” way since reaching a healthy weight after adopting the Paleo diet. She, too, uses only water to wash, even though she is “at the gym sweating buckets six hours a week”. “I use coconut oil to shave and that’s it,” she says. “Over time, my skin has adjusted. I don’t smell.” She is working on a book about the human microbiome and is convinced her odour-free armpits are a sign that her skin microbiome is healthy.Jackie Hong, a reporter in Yukon, north-west Canada, has eschewed soap in the shower for nine years. “I use my hands to scrub myself and get any grime off, but I’m sitting in court or at my desk most days, so it’s not like I’m getting bombarded with filth.” She was curious to go without soap after an artist told her that he hadn’t lathered up in 20 years. She says she saves time and money and needs “a lot less body lotion”.“There’s nothing wrong with just rinsing,” says Sandy Skotnicki, a Toronto-based dermatologist and the author of the 2018 book Beyond Soap. “I’ve talked to people who haven’t used any kind of detergent in years and they’re perfectly fine.” She says that, since 1950, we have gone from bathing once a week to every day. “Has that changed our skin microbiome? I think the answer is yes. And has that caused a rise in inflammatory skin diseases? I think the answer is yes, but we don’t know.”For Whitlock, a former chemical engineer based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, not washing has been a serious science experiment, the success of which has led him to become a trailblazer in a skincare revolution in soap-free, microbiome-friendly and probiotic products. His inspiration came from researching why horses roll in dirt. His conclusion? To top up their ammonia-metabilising bacteria, making the skin less susceptible to infection.Whitlock had hoped that he would naturally acquire this type of bacteria simply by stopping washing. He didn’t – and grew quite pongy. So, he harvested bacteria from the soil at a local farm and fed them with ammonia and minerals. When they turned the ammonia into nitrate, he knew he had what he wanted and started narrowing them down to a single strain that seemed happiest on human skin. After he applied the bacteria he had cultured – the stuff the horses were apparently after – he stopped smelling.After co-founding the company AOBiome in 2013, Whitlock launched it as a spray: Mother Dirt AO+ Mist, billed as containing “ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB), a peacekeeper that once existed on our skin, but was cleaned away with modern hygiene and lifestyles”. As most people still want to take showers and purchase nice products for their skin, the Mother Dirt range now includes hair, face and body washes free from preservatives and detergents.“There isn’t a whole lot of definition for things like natural probiotics,” says Kit Wallen Russell, the co-founder of the British startup JooMo. “There’s no regulation in the cosmetics industry, which means it’s the wild west for companies saying their products do certain things.” JooMo’s products don’t contain live cultures, but they are preservative-free and, Wallen Russell says, create the conditions for microbes to be attracted from the environment.Hard evidence is lacking in this field. There are no studies demonstrating the negative effects of soap or overwashing. “It sounds like something people just say and pass around like: ‘Well, that makes sense to me,’” says Julie Segre, a senior investigator in microbial genomics at the National Institute of Health in the US. She says there is limited medical evidence for the efficacy of skincare targeting the microbiome. “My position is there’s a lot of promise in this field, but we need a lot more basic science.”Even in her own clinical work with childhood eczema, she says, there is a long way to go before microbes could become part of medical intervention – although that is not to say there is no potential. Segre singles out the possibilities of prebiotic ingredients “where you put creams on your skin that can help the beneficial microbes grow”.While Mother Dirt, as a cosmetic brand, makes no health claims, its owner, AOBiome, is a pharmaceutical company running clinical trials on a surprising array of treatments: not only acne, eczema and rosacea, but also allergic rhinitis, hypertension and migraine. Whitlock says that, after using AOB, he was able to stop taking a drug for his high blood pressure, a result that was replicated in AOBiome’s acne study.“When we looked at the safety data, people’s blood pressure dropped,” says Jim Hoffman, one of the company’s directors. “Nobody’s blood pressure dropped dangerously. All of a sudden, you’re looking at hundreds of people and saying there’s really something here.” In the resulting blood pressure study, it was observed that no one trialling AOB treatment had had a headache. “In the placebo group, people had the normal number of headaches, but in the drug group: zero headaches,” says Hoffman. A hypothesis for a migraine treatment evolved from there. Trials are continuing.Meanwhile, the jury is out on the best way to ensure a healthy skin microbiome. Mother Dirt’s CEO, the biochemist Jasmina Aganovic, says detergents such as sodium lauryl sulphate and sodium dodecyl sulphate should be avoided, so as to protect the sensitive AOB. Even essential oils, such as lavender and tea tree, have antimicrobial capabilities. “It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use them, but you need to be careful about how – not all over the body, not super-concentrated,” she says.Spending time outdoors, and “forest bathing” in particular, has also been shown to be beneficial to the microbiome. But, Aganovic hastens to add: “The tempered approach of the scientist is there’s a lot we don’t know, and we’re excited about the potential, but we must also be careful not to overclaim.”There is one area where most agree that soap is still useful. Ballantyne continues to reach for soap for hand washing, but opts for a lower pH type. Segre also recommends hand-washing with soap. As Skotnicki puts it: “Washing your hair and your body has very little to do with hygiene. But washing your hands is essential.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3bc940f7cb37d36d04d702e917a5869a837f63b/510_138_4143_2486/master/4143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44d5c0f19232e61880e90a9f68052266","title":"bbc apologises after presenter calls muslim prayer sign is salute","story":"The broadcaster edited the documentary due to be shown on BBC One on Monday nightThe BBC has apologised and amended a Panorama documentary presented by Stacey Dooley after she inadvertently described a Muslim prayer sign as a terrorist salute.Stacey Meets the IS Brides, which is due to be shown on BBC One on Monday night, features the presenter travelling to camps in Syria to meet women who left their own countries to join Islamic State.In one scene, trailed on Sunday night’s News at Ten, Dooley described leaving a camp and watching “women raising their index finger in an IS salute” – without making it clear that the gesture also had another meaning.Isis fighters have often deployed the single-finger gesture in propaganda images but Tell MAMA, an organisation which measures anti-Muslim attacks, pointed out that the symbol had a much wider use representing Muslims’ commitment to monotheism.“Tawhid (Tawheed) is the defining doctrine of Islam, demonstrating the oneness of Allah (God),” they said. “To reduce such a fundamental and important concept to a mere ‘IS salute’ is grossly wrong, ignorant, and damaging. This again demonstrates the importance of having Muslim representation in media, and more broadly, improving religious literacy.”The BBC said they would remove the relevant voiceover from Dooley’s documentary before broadcast, in addition to editing programmes and online clips which had already been published.Both the Mirror and the Sun have since edited articles on their websites which repeated the claims that the hand sign was an IS symbol.“We wrongly described a gesture made by women filmed in a Kurdish controlled detention camp in northern Syria as an ‘IS salute’,” said a BBC spokesman.“While IS have attempted to adopt this for their own propaganda purposes, for accuracy we should have been clear that many people of Muslim faith use this gesture to signify the oneness of Allah.

The dome structures, which were reportedly influenced by the homes on the planet Tatooine in Star Wars, will eventually be used as low-income housing if all goes as planned, West said in a recent interview.West first outlined his concept for the community in another interview in April last year, boasting, characteristically, that he intended to change the face of real-estate development as we know it.“I’m going to be one of the biggest real-estate developers of all time, what Howard Hughes was to aircrafts and what Henry Ford was to cars, just the relationships I have with architects, my understanding of space and sacred proportions, just this new vibe, this new energy,” he said. “We’re gonna develop cities.”The domes, which sit on a 300-acre plot West owns, stand about 50ft high, it has been reported, and ideas for the architecture are said to have been drawn “from every period of man’s existence on earth”.According to TMZ, West has said the concept for the community is one “he believes will break the barriers that separate classes … namely, the rich, the middle class and the poor”.In the recent Forbes interview with West the writer Zack O’Malley was given sight of the structures. O’Malley reported: “He tells me they could be used as living spaces for the homeless, perhaps sunk into the ground with light filtering in through the top. We stand there in silence for several minutes considering the structures before walking back down to his lurking Lamborghini and zooming off into the night.”Calabasas, a city in Los Angeles county, is an especially wealthy area, home to numerous celebrities including the Kardashian Wests, Miley Cyrus and Drake.Earlier this year it was reported West pulled out of Coachella when the festival said it would not be able to construct a dome to encompass his performance. The dome, organizers said, would have displaced too many portable toilets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9def2229b9e3575caae4d6cd0791f3867047614a/767_1106_2003_1202/master/2003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b5231f249c9473d71c614693a7409db","title":"noel gallagher i liked my mum until she gave birth to liam","story":"Jeremy Corbyn, the climate crisis, nuclear war and feminism: the former Oasis songwriter has opinions to burn. But it’s all a bit of a laugh until it gets to his younger brother‘This,” says Noel Gallagher, nodding towards my dictaphone, “is going to end in trouble. It always does.” Well, let’s hope so! An hour spent in Gallagher’s company is thrillingly unfiltered territory. “Interviews are an occupational hazard,” he says, settling down with a cup of tea. “But that’s because they’re such weird situations. You’re sat in a room with some guy from Stockholm who you’ve never met and he’s asking you about your mum. It’s fucking preposterous. Because the honest answer to that is: ‘What’s it got to do with you?’ But the smart answer is always: ‘I liked her until she gave birth to Liam.’”Oh yes, Liam. There will be plenty more about the youngest Gallagher brother, some of it delivered with real venom now their relationship has sunk to its lowest point. Last month, Noel accused Liam of “intimidating women” after posting screenshots allegedly showing aggressive texts sent to Noel’s teenage daughter, Anaïs. And there will be plenty more on other subjects likely to land him in a spot of bother, too: including the rarely discussed benefits of global warming. “I’m walking around today in a T-shirt, and I’m thinking ...” Gallagher looks up to mock-assess the weather, fully aware he is about to send some  readers berserk, “... it’s not even remotely chilly. Sure, it’ll be bad for my grandkids. But I’ve not met them yet. They might be a load of cunts, d’you know what I mean?”But let’s start with the music, as Noel prepares to release This Is the Place, the second of three EPs planned for this year. It follows Black Star Dancing, his Nile Rodgers-approved disco single. That saw him throw away the shackles of the guitar-led sound that once dominated his career as it moved from incredible peaks – those glorious first Oasis albums, whose melodic euphoria led to generation-defining gigs at Knebworth in 1996 – to the troughs, in which the band became plodding and predictable, only to implode with a blazing backstage row before a gig in Paris in 2009.Gallagher admits to being “set in my ways”, but it sounds like he is having fun writing music again. He credits the producer David Holmes – “one of the biggest musical influences in my life” – for getting him to ditch his favoured instrument and write in the studio. This Is the Place (the title is taken from Tony Walsh’s poem to Manchester, read aloud in Albert Square after the Manchester arena bombing) takes a space-rock journey through Ian Brown, Primal Scream and the Smiths, and it is almost frustrating it has taken him so long to get here. You wonder how things might have panned out if he had written more adventurous songs like these for Oasis back in the late 90s.“And people started calling me a Nazi!” he says. “I thought: ‘Really? A member of the Third Reich?’ Look, I think it’s ridiculous that we’re leaving. None of us were even qualified to vote. You ask a guy above a chippy in Bradford if we should leave Europe. ‘Yeah!’ But I still think if there’s a second referendum, as a nation, we’ll never recover. We have to come out because, no matter how ill-informed people were, you’re saying to them their vote doesn’t count. And its symptomatic of shutting people’s opinions down.”Oasis were renowned for drunken debauchery, bust-ups and brawls, but what is often forgotten is the spirit of togetherness they fostered. While their Britpop rivals Blur examined the country’s condition with lofty detachment, Oasis were all about the collective experience. Noel says he has the Hacienda and rave culture to thank for it.“Acid house changed my life,” he says. “You look at the words to those songs ... it’s all about unity, ‘us’, the whole communal thing. So when I started writing songs, instinctively, that’s how I did it. It was never about me, it was ‘you and me’. It was never ‘us versus them’ because there is no them! So when people go on about Oasis, they miss the point. It wasn’t about snarling and shouting and gobbing in the street. It was inclusive. That’s why so many people turned up to the gigs. And that’s why if I got up tomorrow morning and said: ‘Let’s do it’” – he clicks his fingers – “the world would change again. Because people never forget the way you made them feel.”Can’t he just reunite the group and bring the country back together, then? He sighs. Despite his opinionated outbursts in the press, he is no more sure than any of us about how to get out of this mess. In fact, he seems genuinely curious about it all. “Do you think there should be a second referendum?” he asks at one point. Probably, I say, which is met with a sharp intake of breath. “Oooh, really? That’s just going to cause more ision, though, innit?”Despite all the ision, Gallagher remains sanguine about the future. “That’s the great thing about nuclear bombs,” he says, introducing the subject of apocalypse with alarming cheer. “Ever since they’ve been invented, everyone’s been like: ‘Hang on a minute, are we going for it or what?’ We’re all fed this thing that the guy from North Korea is an insane lunatic. But he’s into basketball! How mad can he be? So we’ll be all right. As for beyond that, well ... fuck the grandkids – remember, they might be cunts. I’ve said it to my sons many times. They go: ‘Dad!’ but I tell them they don’t know who they’re gonna marry. She might be an idiot. Or he might be. We’re all modern men.”Does Noel feel modern? Over the years, he has developed something of a grumpy old man persona.“I feel modern in some respects and old-fashioned in others.”How does he feel about gender fluidity?“What’s that?” he asks. “I know what gender I am – Mancunian.”Would he describe himself as a feminist?“Oh, absolutely. I didn’t realise until my wife told me I was and I said: ‘Really? Well, I’ve got to announce that to the world then.’ But definitely, I am. When you’ve got a teenage daughter, you better get with it pretty quick. She comes to my gigs with her teenage pals now and … it’s something else, believe me. They can talk to you, lucidly, without missing a beat, while texting someone in Ghana, while buying a pair of shoes and listening to music at the same time ... who invented these people?”Gallagher is 52 now, but it seems Anaïs and his boys, Donovan and Sonny, are helping him keep up with the changing cultural landscape. Last month, on tour in the Netherlands, he turned on his hotel TV to watch Stormzy headlining Glastonbury and thought: “Oh, so that’s what my two lads are on about. Because they’ll be doing these dances in the kitchen when they’re getting ready for school and I’ll be thinking: ‘What’s a vossi bop?’ I didn’t realise it was to do with grime.”Stormzy and Oasis are musically worlds apart, but both are products of working-class Britain, even if Stormzy’s union flag stab vest is a different beast to the one painted on Gallagher’s guitar for Oasis’s triumphant shows at Manchester City’s ground in 1996 – a symbol of Cool Britannia, an icon of a country shaking off years of Tory rule.“It’s music as English as Pulp, or the Jam or the Kinks,” says Noel of grime in general. “And it’s their own language, which is a great thing that something born on council estates out of poverty and street culture has got to the main stage at Glastonbury. Now, if I’m a 52-year-old father of three living in Maida Vale, then he’s talking street jive to me. He’s talking about some guy stabbing him in the back when he was a kid – I’m not humming along to that! He is good, though, and Skepta is great. I remember seeing him at the Brits – just him under the spotlight, and thinking: ‘Wow, it’s fucking powerful, man.’”In 2008, Gallagher was criticised for saying Jay-Z was the “wrong” act to headline Glastonbury (“Glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music,” he said. “I’m not having hip-hop at Glastonbury.”) Does he regret that now?“That happened because I’d been away in the States for four months and some reporter told me Glastonbury had hip-hop on and hadn’t sold out. So, I was just like: ‘Oh well, hip-hop’s shit!’ That was it. Of course, your esteemed colleagues at the  seemed to make a lot more of it than it was …”So, it is all our fault then?“Absolutely it’s your fault. Everything is your fault.”There is, however, one person Gallagher thinks will always be wrong to appear at Glastonbury: Jeremy Corbyn, who received a rapturous reception when he delivered a speech there in 2017.“I saw him walk onstage to ‘Oooh, Jeremy Corbyn’ and thought: ‘Really? For a start, your name’s Jeremy.’ I don’t trust him. I think that the bare requirement for a politician, particularly a leader, is to be forward-looking. When I watch the news, I just think that, for these people, the big picture is communism, right? And that’s not British.”They are not communists, though.And just wait until we get to Liam’s recent solo performance at the festival. “I’d read somewhere that it was a headline set in the making, so I thought: ‘Fucking hell, better watch this,’” he says. “I don’t think I’ve ever been so embarrassed for a man in my entire life. He’s pulled off the incredible magic trick of making those Oasis songs sound weedy and thin. And he looked like he was having the worst day of his life, walking around in what looks like a pair of my son’s pyjamas, shouting into a mic about some perceived injustice ... if you can’t sing ’em, don’t play ’em!”Noel hasn’t seen Liam’s recent documentary, As it Was, although he plans to: “Because I’ve heard it’s hilarious.” The film is clearly a PR job for Liam’s side of the story, although it is an entertaining watch due to Liam’s onscreen charisma and the fact it shows a different side to the singer – one who displays self-doubt and admits to being lost after the breakup of Oasis. Noel isn’t the focus, but he is portrayed as aloof and uncaring, the brother who wasn’t there for Liam when he was struggling through his orce from Nicole Appleton.Noel bursts out laughing when I bring this up: “I wasn’t there for him? Well, he wasn’t there for his wife either, was he?”Noel’s tone changes dramatically when we talk about Liam. Most of his outrageous comments are said for a laugh, but when it comes to Liam he seems genuinely angry. What did he mean when he accused his brother of intimidating women?“That’s not the first time he’s sent texts to my daughter, or left threatening phone calls on my wife’s answering machine. So when he’s threatening my wife via my teenage daughter, I’m thinking, you know, if you weren’t a rock star, if you were just an uncle who worked in a garage, you’d be getting a visit from the police. But because you’re a rockstar, wahey, you get away with that shit.”Has this gone past the point of you two ever making up?Noel nods: “Because I’ve got one fatal flaw in my otherwise perfect makeup as a human being, which is I don’t forgive people. Once you start texting my children – and his two sons have been going for her, too – and legitimise my wife being bullied on the internet, where she has to shut down Instagram accounts because of the vile shit being written about her and my daughter, then it ain’t happening.”When did he last see Liam?“At the Etihad Stadium when City won the league about three years ago. Whenever I see him, he’s actually very polite, and you can see in his eyes that he’s just about to piss his trousers. But then he comes up with these scenarios of when we meet, that only ever take place in his own head.” He puts on his Liam voice again: “Ah fuckin’ went over and flicked him in the ear and said: ‘Eh, fuckin’ ’ell, keep it dangerous, you cunt.’”Has he heard Liam’s solo material?“I don’t listen to the albums, because I can’t stand his voice. But I hear it on the radio.”What does he think?“I think it’s unsophisticated music. For unsophisticated people. Made by an unsophisticated man. Who’s giving unsophisticated orders to a load of songwriters who think they’re doing the Oasis thing. Which goes back to what I was saying before. You can turn the Marshall amp up to 12 all you want and do a bit of glam, but Oasis words were about including people, everyone in it together. And what I hear from him is just a load of bile ... angry nonsense.”It is time to wrap up, but Gallagher’s still going.“I reckon if I put my two sons in a room – one’s nine, one’s 11 – for about 45 minutes, they could probably muster up something better than that new single of his,” he says.Is this all just a crafty way of hyping up a future Oasis reunion?“I wish it was,” he laughs. “It boils down to, on a personal level, fuck him. But also, artistically, why do it again? You know, I was watching the news the other night and he was on there, threatening to break my jaw – live on the ITV news! Isn’t there a law against that? – and it’s about an Oasis reunion and he’s like: ‘Me bags are packed, mate.’ And I’m thinking: ‘Who are you expecting to call you? Me?’ Nobody wants to be in a band with him apart from a load of indie Championship players – journeymen, who are in it for all the crisps they can eat.”It seems silly to ask whether Gallagher has anything else he would like to add. Because of course he does. He always does.“Yeah,” he says, getting up and pointing again at my dictaphone: “Don’t quote me on any of that.”This Is the Place is out today, taken from the EP of the same name, which will be released on 27 SeptemberPhotographed at The Trafalgar St. James.

We take a look at the craftsmanship that goes into each trainer at the site in MassachusettsFew trainers can claim a fanbase as erse as that of the New Balance 990 series. The first trainer to cost $100 when it was released in 1982, it was a performance running shoe that was eventually embraced for its nerdy dad look (the late Steve Jobs was a fan), while also acquiring street cred in Baltimore and DC. Meanwhile, the 990v4, which was released in 2016, popped up at fashion shows while being name checked by rappers such as Meek Mill and Lil Yachty.Each pair of 990v5s takes three hours to make they’re constructed from more than 30 different components and are handled by more than 30 workers. Tejada is the leader of the “closing” team, which puts the final touches on the shoe – hand-sewing the leather and suede in the heel. She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation. So you have the mother who has been here that taught the daughter, who had taught the son,” he says.And at New Balance, the workers don’t just make the shoes – they are also integrated into the design process. This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts. I can’t tell them how to stitch the shoe. I have no idea how to stitch it. I know what I want to do, but they are experts and the value they add is incredible,” he says.And the atmosphere on the line embodies that spirit of collaboration. The workers move quickly – they each have just 22.5 seconds to complete their task – but still find moments to greet each other warmly.Luis Puello, a 51-year-old leather cutter, carefully runs his hands across a sheet of pig’s hide, looking for defects that he marks with a laser before a machine makes a cut. Over the years, he says, he has developed a better feel for the leather, quickly sensing which parts will function best in different areas of the shoe.He smiles when asked what he thinks about the 990s that he helps make every day. “When the job is done, you see what you’ve done, and you feel proud,” he says.New Balance’s 990v5s are available at the New Balance London flagship store or newbalance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45c4c0421651847b2fb3c89c779c96825af739a/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9104a8fbe287510bd6c4115b3bfdbaa","title":"the evolution of the new balance 99x series in pictures","story":"The New Balance 990v5 – which was released in the UK in May this year – is the latest trainer in a 37-year footwear dynasty.

The fact is that a lot of people living around Brecon are more insulated from the problems of society than people living elsewhere. Oliver ElkingtonA pretty close result in the end. Tory party would have held it if Brexit party hadn’t taken so many votes, or if GreensPlaid had not stood aside. The Brexit debacle is so serious party politics should take a back seat. Hopefully the progressive alliance will hold and Borish Johnson will be too up himself to get a pact going with Farage. Not sure where Labour fit in the battle of the coalitions, but not a great night for them either. RedSalamanderI’m delighted that a party which unequivocally opposes Brexit won last night.But we shouldn’t get carried away. Johnson will be pretty relieved at how the Conservative vote held up and if you add Conservative and Brexit Party vote share together, then their combined vote is higher than the Lib Dems. He will push the line that if you want Brexit delivered, you have to swing behind the Conservatives.On Labour: nobody is fooled by Corbyn’s ‘“constructive ambiguity” any more. It’s blatantly obvious that he wants Brexit and all his dithering and vagueness is intended to mug off his own party. TheGoodThiefThe remain-alliance’s total votes are less than the Conservative plus Brexit plus UKIP total, so expect plenty of politicians saying that this shows that the Tories need to move to a harder Brexit.More interesting to me is the Brexit politicians who are saying that they wouldn’t vote for a version of the withdrawal agreement without the backstop, showing that Boris Johnson either doesn’t know his own party, or has been lying whenever he’s suggested that a WA without the backstop could pass Parliament. octaariThe polls tell us there is a Boris Johnson bounce – they are back in the lead. And given the circumstances of this by-election, a seat they’d been widely expected to lose heavily from what I’ve read over the past few weeks, the narrow losing margin seems to confirm that.What the result shows is what can be achieved through electoral alliances. The winning margin was about the same as Plaid Cymru’s vote at the last election, and they didn’t stand this time. The Brexit Party’s 3,300 votes would have given the Tories a comfortable majority. Very grim result for Labour. stringvestorThere is still a substantial pro-Brexit vote out there. That is not surprising since we have not yet left the EU and what might happen is still speculation. Whereas we are still in the EU and people can blame everything they do not like on Brussels. Let’s see how the Brexit vote holds up after we have left and the consequences start to kick in.

But the England hooker insists international rugby and the cauldron of a World Cup will require a step up even from the mindset that delivered Saracens’ knockout rugby triumphs last season.England spent last week training in sweltering heat and humidity in Treviso, in north-eastern Italy, to experience conditions similar to those that lie ahead in Japan. While most players struggled with ball-handling in such greasy conditions, for George it was lineout throwing that provided the most strenuous challenge.“It was difficult. It doesn’t rain too much over there but the ball does get extremely slippery so it was a different type of challenge,” he says. “We didn’t use too many towels, so we didn’t get too much opportunity to dry the balls. It was a tough challenge but one you had to get your head around.”It has been a coming-of-age four years for George. In the summer of 2015 he had just been drafted into Stuart Lancaster’s preliminary World Cup squad, replacing Dylan Hartley who was left out after picking up a ban that would have ruled him out of the opening match. George made his international debut in one of the two warmup matches in which he featured, and he came off the bench in the dead-rubber walloping of Uruguay following England’s premature elimination from the competition at the pool stage.As Japan looms in the World Cup cycle he now has a Lions series to New Zealand under his belt, he has become a crucial cog in Saracens’ domestic and European dominance, and he is now England’s undisputed first-choice hooker.“It’s amazing. My first cap in the pre-World Cup games last time around seems a long time ago. It’s an incredibly exciting time to be involved in English rugby,” says the 28-year-old. “There’s huge excitement and belief amongst the group that we can really do something special.”The excitement for the World Cup – with England’s first match on 22 September against Tonga – is palpable in George’s every word. But, with consecutive warm-up matches against Wales to come –the first on Sunday at Twickenham – he is not getting ahead of himself.“Whenever England play Wales it is going to have an edge to it. They are Test matches, playing them home and away, and they are both amazing opportunities to put our best foot forward and right a few wrongs from that game in the Six Nations.”To do so England need all their experienced international-class players. Thankfully for Eddie Jones the experienced loosehead prop Joe Marler, who played for the Barbarians against England at Twickenham in July, has declared himself available for selection after announcing his retirement in September last year. George knows Marler well from England duty as well as the Lions tour to New Zealand and has nothing but praise for the 29-year-old.“Whenever Marler’s around, it’s always extremely entertaining. He’s been amazing,” George says. “It seems a long time since he left – a lot has happened. He’s a joker off the field but he’s a calm head on it and has a huge amount of experience. He keeps things nice and calm, adding some key points around the new scrummaging laws. He’s been vital around that. He just wanted to play with me again I think!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a984e63171d7b015f7cce140a23821208af6924/301_605_2076_1245/master/2076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f9cf7914646eb8de94ec9391d6b1df4","title":"kia super league starts","story":"Tuesday marks the start of the final Kia Super League which, after four years as the premier domestic women’s competition in England, will be replaced next season by the Women’s Hundred – part of a shake-up that will also result in the 50-over Women’s County Championship being supplanted by eight regional centres of excellence.With women’s cricket under the microscope after England were dismantled in the Ashes series, a lot is riding on the success of the changes. The ECB director of women’s cricket, Clare Connor, admitted the disparity between the sides’ domestic structures was a “big contributing factor” to the defeat.Since August 2017, professional contracts have been provided to all Australian women’s state players, while the English women’s county set-up has remained amateur. However, the ECB will invest £20m into women’s and girls’ cricket over the next two years to establish the centres of excellence made up of a consortium of several counties in each region. For example, Middlesex will host the London and East centre, which is likely to include players from Essex, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Norfolk and Suffolk.The centres, which will be set up in October and also have feeder academies, will provide year-round training and coaching support for domestic players, who will become semi-professional. The centres will play each other in their 50-over and 20-over competitions.In an email sent to the counties last week and seen by the , Connor states the eight centres will “geographically align with the eight women’s teams that will compete in The Hundred” and that coaching and support staff will be sub-contracted to the Hundred franchises.This appears to confirm the Women’s Hundred teams will have their home at different grounds to the men: for example Taunton is likely to host to both the “Western Fire” Women’s Hundred side and the “South West and Wales” centre of excellence whereas the men will be based in Cardiff.The email also confirms the ECB, having threatened to withdraw funding from women’s county cricket, will continue to run a women’s county Twenty20 competition next year and 2021.Richard Bedbrook, the coach of Surrey Women and the Surrey Stars KSL team, says the changes are “very exciting”. He said: “It will allow players the opportunity of really taking the next steps, from all their cricketing skills to their physical condition to then hopefully bridging the gap with the mental side of it, and allowing them to challenge for the England squad.“If you keep streamlining the talent pool, you create more competition because the teams are much more evenly balanced. The games are played between the best players at the highest standard and therefore more pressure moments occur.”For the England squad, who spend all their time in a “Loughborough bubble”, the centres will provide a much-needed fresh environment. For domestic players, who have always had to juggle work or study with cricket while receiving no remuneration, the revamp is also welcome.“You put in so much effort for so many years, and the fact that now you might actually get a chance to be rewarded for your efforts all year round and become that bit more professional is amazing,” said the 24-year-old batter Aylish Cranstone, who plays for Surrey at county level and in the KSL.There remains widespread concern about the replacement of the Super League with the Women’s Hundred. The KSL attracted more than 40,000 fans to matches across the past two seasons, including two sellout Finals Days at Hove. Players such as Kirstie Gordon, Sophia Dunkley and most recently Mady Villiers have made international debuts largely as a result of impressive performances in the Super League.Cranstone feels she has benefitted enormously from “being around high-level players – seeing how they train, how they go about things and how they deal with high-pressure situations” and admits she is concerned about the future.“It’s taken a few years to get a real fanbase,” she says. “We’ve got Surrey fans and they’ll always be loyal to Surrey but for the other franchises, say Western Storm or Loughborough Lightning, they’ve really gained a fan base that will just come to see them. So it’s upsetting that that’s grown year on year and developed, and that’s now not going to be there any more.”Another area of concern is the lack of information provided to players regarding the amount they can expect to earn and the time commitment required should they win a place at one of the centres. Katie Levick, the Yorkshire Diamonds leg-spinner who juggles cricket with her role as a marketing manager, said: “It’s causing a few headaches from a work perspective!”One thing is certain. The changes represent the biggest shake-up domestic women’s cricket in England has ever seen. The final season of the KSL looks set to be given added impetus as players seek to make their case for inclusion in the new semi-professional setup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6fa276affa673516fe09b868c09f092752db972/44_0_2273_1364/master/2273.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6890b3564fac9cc419d61771b64b5231","title":"england red faces neglecting test cricket ashes australia","story":"It should come as no surprise that batsmen who have been told to whack a white ball into the stands cannot bat the day outWell, that wasn’t supposed to happen. On a mild, sunlit Birmingham day Australia bowled straight, fielded well, swarmed around England’s batsmen and took wickets with disarming ease in front of stands filled with garrulous southern hemisphere voices.As the final clatter began in earnest after lunch the endgame to this first Ashes Test began to feel a little giddy and light-hearted. There were ironic cheers for Moeen Ali as he successfully defended a straight ball from Nathan Lyon. England batsmen were barracked from the centre by the touring support en route to a 251-run defeat. Tim Paine’s team weren’t just in control here. They were enjoying themselves.There is, of course, nothing to be gained from talking up your own home ground as a fortress or a cauldron. Just as in reality a group of drunken men in ostrich costumes are never likely to have any tangible bearing on the fine-point skills, the high-stress internal mechanics of Test cricket. But England will now retreat from one of their most impregnable home venues required to go against the dominant history of modern-day Ashes cricket.In the past 50 years there have been 27 Ashes series. In this time England have only twice lost the first Test and gone on to win the series. Those two occasions were the miracle series of 1981 and the miracle series of 2005. Perhaps we’re heading for another miracle series now. Thirty years on they might still be talking about Rory’s Ashes or the Annus Mo-Rabilis. More ominous for England is the fact that in 17 of those 27 series Australia have won or drawn the first Test and gone on to take the series.There will, of course, be hand‑wringing now, as there must be hand-wringing. But it is also hard to know what England might have done differently. In the past they have lost Ashes Test matches because the players have performed poorly or their selection has been obviously muddled. This is not really the case here.England had one appalling stroke of luck, losing their best bowler in the first hour of play. But even with Jimmy Anderson in the XI some things are now clear. Australia have the best batsman in either team – and indeed the best batsman of the modern era. Australia have the best spinner. Australia have the best pace attack unless conditions even things up.Whereas right now it is easier to pick out the areas of weakness in England’s Test team than its strengths. By the end of this match England reached a point of critical mass, with six players either injured, unproven or in the doldrums (Anderson, Jason Roy, Joe Denly, Jos Buttler, Jonny Bairstow and Moeen) and just five in form and unarguably in the right spot.England batted quite well in the first innings. Joe Root’s presence settled the top order, Stuart Broad bowled well until he was worn down. Chris Woakes was weirdly under-bowled. But that lurking brittleness was there even during those periods when they had the upper hand. Ben Stokes bowled poorly at times on the first day just when England needed to turn the screw. Moeen just needs some time to collect his game. It was at times painful to watch him here.As for Denly, well, perhaps in nine years when he has 25 Test hundreds people will say, can you believe it, they picked him at first as a part time leg-spinner: look at him now, the 42‑year‑old new Bradman. But this will require some fast work.Jos Buttler, England’s Test No 5, has one hundred to his name in first‑class cricket in the past five years. Here he was bowled trying to defend a ball from Pat Cummins that hit the top of off stump. Nathan Lyon bowled superbly, finding just the right line and the right pace to make the fifth‑day pitch work for him.Otherwise there were few surprises in this performance. Members of the team who were looking short of confidence or class at this level continued to do so. And this is pretty much it for England and red‑ball cricket. The options are circumscribed.Jofra Archer will come in, all being well. He is a hugely talented cricketer. But he will be expected to help change the trajectory of an Ashes series having not played a red‑ball game since last September. Otherwise the prominence of white‑ball cricket means there is no cab off the rank, no one in form, no one hammering on the door. The last round of County Championship matches ended on 16 July.Plus, of course, this is a structural thing. Don’t call it a hangover. England’s losing start here is not to do with the aftershocks of the World Cup. It’s to do with the pre‑shocks, the pre-effects. For four years this team, the red ball one, has been secondary in planning and resources. Men who were being asked here to bat the day out have been encouraged to whack a white ball into the stands rather than work on gritty defence on English pitches. England’s team here is pegged around explosive white-ball talents: because these are the talents they have.Not that anyone has anything to answer for here. It is extremely hard in any sport to be good at all the formats, all the competitions. And this was the result for England: a Test team with some loose parts that were expertly exposed here.If there is encouragement to be taken it is that an undercooked, underdone England have four Tests to finesse the gameplan. A change of conditions at Lord’s is more likely to help them than a change of players. But they will have to work fast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fe90788f6977035233d82a30512c27057e5bd2c/75_0_5005_3003/master/5005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f958832a53f0a4dc9df0680a41cb05ec","title":"share your bame experiences of the edinburgh fringe festival","story":"We want to hear from BAME people who are attending - or have attended - the festival.

One theatre-maker has even gone so far as to reject the fringe, instead encouraging black artists to focus on other platforms that serve the BAME community better.The fringe has acknowledged these things as issues, and has placed ersity as a key strand of their Fringe Central programme - but is this enough?We want to hear from BAME people who are attending - or have attended previously - the Edinburgh fringe.Whether you’re a performer, an audience member, or even an Edinburgh native, what have your experiences been during the festival?

Last year Sawant took on one of the word’s biggest corporations, Amazon, with a tax intended to fund public housing, and nearly won.Butterfield reasoned that Amazon, along with the rest of Seattle’s formidable business sector, would make its presence felt as the primary election day on 6 August drew closer.So it has happened. Well over a million dollars in political action committee money has poured into Seattle’s local elections, with the city’s Chamber of Commerce Pac alone spending $1.1m (Amazon contributed $250,000), and two other Pacs pouring in another $477,00.Together, the Pacs have spent over $312,000 on Sawant’s race alone, much of it coming in the form of attack mailers.More than a dozen of Amazon’s top executives have also now donated to one of Sawant’s primary opponents, Egan Orion. The list includes Jay Carney, the former press secretary for the Obama administration who is the PR and policy chief for Amazon. Two of Amazon’s three CEOs have donated to Orion as well, with Jeff Bezos being the only one not to have personally chipped in, according to numbers from the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission.Butterfield, a 35-year-old healthcare worker, was surprised at just how effective the money was, even when spent on campaign mailers. Dozens have hit mailboxes in the district since mid July, and he didn’t grasp their impact until he started seeing – and hearing – it as he went from door to door.“It’s just shocking when you go knock on somebody’s door, and it’s just a barrage of these talking points,” Butterfield said. “It’s not too hard to untie these knots, the arguments these talking points rest on, but you can’t do that with everybody. We can’t knock on every door.”But while the mailers might be effective, the role of business money and Amazon in the race could play well for Sawant, who is facing five other candidates besides Orion, with the top two going on to the general election on 5 November.“This race and indeed all of the city’s elections this year will be a referendum on one fundamental question: who gets to run Seattle? Big business like Amazon and real estate corporations, or working people?” Sawant told the .A 46-year-old former tech worker who left the field to obtain a PhD in economics and enter grassroots organizing, Sawant has built her political career on championing social movements and taking on big business. Her message has resonated in Seattle, a city with one of the highest rates of gentrification in the country, and where residents have become increasingly skeptical of the influence of Amazon and its large downtown campus.Sawant, a member of the Socialist Alternative party, drew national attention in 2015 as one of the driving forces that led Seattle to become the first major city to adopt a $15 minimum wage, and again was in the spotlight in 2018 as she pushed for the so-called “Amazon tax”.The proposal would have levied a $275-per-employee “head tax” on corporations making over $20m a year to fund new public housing and homeless services. Seattle has the third-highest homeless population in the US, behind only New York and LA.The tax initially passed, but was repealed only a month later after Amazon threatened to move jobs out of the city and teamed up with labor unions, who were afraid of job losses, in a campaign that attacked the plan as a job-killer that could drive the city’s largest private employer out of town.The differences between Sawant and Orion, both ideological and strategic, are telling in that they echo conflicts occurring between progressives across the country. While the two agree on the problems facing the city, like homelessness and affordable housing, they offer radically different ways of solving them.Sawant’s uncompromising style of confrontational, movement-driven politics has made her enemies – including some in labor – and critics often accuse her of being isive. Orion, an entrepreneur known for saving the city’s pride festival, PrideFest, says he represents a different approach.As the executive director of a neighborhood chamber of commerce, he accepts that business is backing his campaign. He criticizes Sawant for receiving a substantial amount of inidual donations from people outside the state – and she’s raised more money than other candidates, reflecting the fact that she’s an incumbent with a national profile. For his part, Orion sees the support he gets from business as a sign of the effectiveness of his less confrontational, more partnership-driven model of politics.”“Kshama Sawant is the worst partner for our large businesses. You know, a bologna sandwich would be a better partner,” he told the .On homelessness, Orion argues the city doesn’t need more tax revenue from business but instead should focus on “getting better outcomes”, with the funds currently being distributed to non-profits who work with the homeless population.The two also differ on how the city should create more affordable housing. Orion favors increasing urban density and cutting regulations to encourage developers to build more housing, arguing that would increase housing supply, and therefore lower prices.Sawant advocates for rent control, an idea, that despite its many critics in academia, is resurfacing as a force in Europe, with some traction in the US as well. Like the yimbys, she supports density and upzoning, but thinks the government and not the private sector should be doing most of the building, saying that purely market-based solutions are “naive at best”.For Rich Smith, a reporter covering the race for Seattle’s alternative weekly, the Stranger, a Sawant v Orion matchup, if it happens in the general election, would reflect a larger clash happening in the city between more well-off residents who identify as progressive on cultural issues like gay marriage or immigration, but are more moderate on economic issues like taxes or housing, and against younger, working-class voters who are generally more willing to embrace the ideas of socialist candidates like Sawant.“There is a whole contingent of people in Seattle who typically have money, who are Democrats or consider themselves progressive, and think that Seattle is the most progressive place on the planet,” he said. “And so they don’t like it when people point out that there’s huge issues, at least structurally in terms of homelessness, transit, economic inequality, housing or other crises that we’re facing,” he said.Butterfield, the Sawant campaign volunteer, thinks her direct style makes existing conflicts more visible, and he welcomes it.“That’s why people call her isive and claim that she won’t bring everyone to the table,” he said. “As though Amazon doesn’t have a voice in Seattle politics, it’s preposterous, right? I mean, they own the damn table.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0f3afb3e82df9999bdc8cd771beb0a8631d112e/0_187_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd72ee9c5527a4b097c110d97adf4d07","title":"feral hogs memes twitter 30 50 running into my yard small kids","story":"A Twitter user’s loaded question has been widely mocked, but there’s actually more to it than many have assumedAs the gun control debate rages in the US in the wake of a weekend of devastating mass shootings, calls for an assault weapons ban have resurfaced. While this has led many Americans to cite their second amendment rights, one man in Arkansas has asked a simple question: “How do I kill the 30-50 feral hogs that run into my yard within 3-5 mins while my small kids play?”It all began when Willam McNabb, who identifies as a libertarian, waded into a debate about assault weapons (high-powered rifles were reportedly used by the gunmen in both El Paso and Dayton).The feral hogs have also been woven into already popular meme formats, and song lyrics:Meanwhile, some people have just appreciated the brief moment of levity that the moment has provided:However, while McNabb’s tweet has provided some well-needed levity, the reality is that large groups of feral hogs are a real problem across parts of the US.Evan Wood, an editor for Missouri Life magazine who has covered hog problems in his state, told the : “They are actually a huge problem, both on private property and public lands. They live in groups (called sounders) of up to 60 hogs. They are very harmful for farmers because when they eat, they upturn the ground to get things out.”According to estimates from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), feral hogs cause $1.5bn in damage nationwide every year. Meanwhile, the Missouri Department of Conservation has declared feral hogs “invasive pests that need to be eliminated from Missouri” that can “destroy a crop field in a single night”.Does this mean Americans should have access to high-powered rifles to deal with the problem, as McNabb seems to suggest?Wood says no. “If you go after them with a gun your chances of getting all of them at once are pretty much nil, even if there are only like 10 of them,” he says. “So the ones that survive often scatter, and because of how quickly they can breed, that creates more groups and impacts new land. Plus a lot of times they’ll end up coming back”This is supported by conservation experts. “From what we’ve seen in Missouri and in other states, we know that hunting is not effective at eliminating feral hogs,” wrote Missouri’s Department of Conservation last year. “Here in Missouri, a shoot-on-sight strategy was encouraged for over 20 years. During that time, the feral hog population continued to grow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/459c2ea5585a432ea88713591263720dc503dc59/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50e9d6cd1374dfce8e0eadfc471f279b","title":"pro lgbt coca cola ads spark boycott calls in hungary","story":"Campaign linked to Sziget festival criticised by senior member of ruling Fidesz partyAdvertisements by Coca-Cola relating to a popular music festival in Hungary that promote gay acceptance have prompted a boycott call from a senior member of the conservative ruling party.The posters are timed for the week-long Sziget festival – that takes the theme of “Love Revolution” and starts on Wednesday in Budapest – and show gay people and couples smiling with slogans such as “zero sugar, zero prejudice”.That has annoyed some supporters of Viktor Orbán’s nationalist Fidesz party, which opposes same-sex marriage.Born in 1963 in Székesfehérvár in central Hungary, Viktor Orbán has been leader of the Fidesz national conservative party in two long stints since 1993. He has been Hungary’s prime minister between 1998 and 2002, and again since 2010. After two years of military service he studied law in Budapest, and then political science at Pembroke College, Oxford.For nationalists across Europe, Orbán has become a hero, the embodiment of a nativist leader willing to eschew liberal political correctness and speak aggressively about the need to defend so-called Christian Europe. Steve Bannon has called him Trump before Trump, and Nigel Farage and Italy’s Matteo Salvini are admirers.For many liberals, and increasingly for some of his supposed allies in the EPP, he signifies all that is rotten, corrupt and downright scary in contemporary politics on the continent.“The age of liberal democracy is at an end,” Orbán told the Hungarian parliament shortly after Fidesz won a third successive electoral victory in 2018. “It is no longer able to protect people’s dignity, provide freedom, guarantee physical security or maintain Christian culture.”His messaging, repeated in speeches and interviews ad nauseam, is that he is on a mission to protect Hungary and the rest of Europe from the evils of migration from the Middle East and Africa. He has frequently accused the Hungarian-born financier George Soros of a conspiracy to overrun Europe with Muslim migrants.Orbán’s Fidesz party has a two-thirds majority in the Hungarian parliament, which gives him leeway to make sweeping constitutional changes, and he has spoken of a plan to reshape the country over the next decade. He has installed loyalists in previously independent institutions, put a vast media network under the control of cronies and brushed off protests from the disgruntled urban elites.One thing Orbán’s admirers and detractors agree on is that he has become symbolic of something bigger than the fate of a smallish central European state with a population of fewer than 10 million. The man himself clearly relishes his increasingly large role in European political discourse.Frustrated with Brussels and other European critics, Orbán has built alliances with neighbouring countries, notably throughout the V4, which comprises Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, all of whose leaders have at times expressed varying degrees of unhappiness with the EU, and whose unity in messaging is growing.For Orbán, the idea that he is up against an exhausted, decaying vision of Europe is one that he has returned to again and again in his speeches. In October 2018, he implicitly compared today’s EU to the Nazis, Soviets and other imperial powers.On Sunday, Fidesz’s deputy speaker István Boldog called for a boycott of Coca-Cola products during what he labelled a “provocative” campaign. But with gay acceptance rising among Hungarians, it was unclear if his call would gain traction.Still, rightwing news portals echoed his antipathy. “The homosexual lobby is laying siege to Budapest, leaving no space to avoid this,” complained one, Pesti Srácok.Orbán, who rails against immigrants, promotes ethnic homogeneity and claims he seeks to protect Europe’s Christian traditions, opposes equal rights for same-sex couples while advocating quiet gay-straight co-existence.On Monday Coca-Cola said that the Sziget festival, expected to draw more than half a million people, echoes core principles of the US multinational. “We believe both hetero- and homosexuals have the right to love the person they want, the way they want,” the company said.Fidesz stopped short of endorsing Boldog’s boycott call, saying Hungarians were free to choose whether to drink Coke.Tamás Dombos, an advocate with the Háttér gay rights group, said the government was homophobic but also aware of society’s growing acceptance of gay lifestyles.“We have a feeling they are testing people in this subject,” Dombos said. “The entire government propaganda is built on conflict, and they need enemies. After the EU, migrants, NGOs and even the homeless, now it may be LGBTQ people.“Sometimes it’s hard to dissect whether it’s a political strategy or just an inherent real homophobe getting mad at something like Coke’s campaign.”According to a 2018 Háttér study, nearly two-thirds of Hungarians believe gay people should be free to live as they please, up from less than half in 2002.Gay rights have caused more of a stir in Poland, where ruling rightwing Law and Justice (PiS) party, a Fidesz ally, has launched an anti-gay campaign in an apparent attempt to re-energise its mainly rural base. One conservative magazine distributed “LGBT-free zone” stickers and some towns have declared themselves “LGBT-free”.In Hungary, the parliament speaker this year equated gay adoption to “paedophilia in a moral sense”.Orbán has rarely addressed the issue head on, though in a 2016 interview he said gay people “can do what they want but cannot get their marriages recognised by the state… An apple cannot ask to be called a pear.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07095768f6217a3b38d95b53035e63b05afdb2e8/0_210_5669_3402/master/5669.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b0b609ec6d9f393d411a4ef59d29619","title":"sally rugg as queer people we open up the most intimate parts of ourselves to the majority","story":"In a new book, a erse group of Australians share their stories of growing up, coming out and finding community Benjamin Law: when did you first think you were different to the heterosexual kids around you?Sally Rugg: When I realised I was gay, I was about 19. It was honestly like this penny-drop moment, where all of a sudden everything made sense. All this information about myself – all these memories and feelings – suddenly crystallised. Retrospectively, it’s like, “Oh my god, of course.” But I didn’t know. I was having sex with women and didn’t ...Put two and two together?No!What changed at 19?I had a crush on a girl in a way that was different from anything before. I couldn’t get this person out of my head. I would go to sleep-thinking about this girl. I remember driving down Stirling Highway in Perth and it clicked in my head, this sudden realisation. I had an autonomic response to this realisation. And it felt like realising I had cancer.Gee. How so?I was driving and crying because all of a sudden there was a thing inside me. I didn’t choose it, I couldn’t get rid of it, I couldn’t control it.You don’t want to be the thing people tease you about.Exactly. One of the other things I was scared of was that friends of mine would say, “I told you so.” The shame that other people knew this thing about me before I knew it. I hated that.A distraction from other important LGBTIQA+ issues?Exactly. And I kind of thought the institution itself was gross and weird. And I took umbrage with the fact I was given the campaign: “Well, it’s just ’cause I’m gay!” Whereas now I look back on it and I’m like, “That’s good. We should have people from affected communities involved and leading.”What swung you around to the fight?At the end of 2013, the ACT accidentally legalised same-sex marriage for six days it was a bureaucratic fuck-up. I went to Canberra in my capacity as a same-sex marriage campaigner and attended a bunch of weddings as a guest, making videos and lobbying – stuff like that. And I went to the wedding of Ivan and Chris Hinton-Teoh. It was the first time I’d been to a wedding where I didn’t think it was gross and weird. I felt like I belonged there. When I looked around, there were my people.Suddenly it was a queer space.Yeah. Watching Chris and Ivan get married, seeing this demonstrated to me, I realised marriage belongs to us as well. It’s not a heterosexual thing that’s being extended to us. We’re just as entitled to it. From that moment on, I became completely obsessed with it. I remembered being 19, discovering I was gay and feeling like I had cancer. And I didn’t want other young people – when they’re discovering who they are – to feel like that. That was the other part of my obsession with marriage equality. My belief was – and remains – that if kids grow up knowing it’s OK to be gay, they’re going to have the same opportunities and the same acceptance.In what ways do you feel you’re still growing up as a queer person in Australia?I grew up a lot over the five years I worked on the marriage equality campaign. For better and for worse, I developed a hardened shell to withstand that much criticism – from opponents and community alike – to withstand the torrents of anonymous abuse and attacks in the rightwing media and to withstand the constant setbacks on the campaign.It’s a trade-off, isn’t it? On the one hand, emotional vulnerability is a really important asset to have but it can be a liability.Totally. And the nature of the marriage equality campaign – but also the nature of all LGBTIQA+ reform – is built on the back of people telling their personal stories. As queer people, we open up the most intimate parts of ourselves and our lives and our families in order to appeal to the majority.For them to recognise our basic human dignity.In the desperate hope they’ll see their humanity reflected in ours.And that’s taxing.Yeah. So I think in the wake of opening up myself repeatedly, again and again, once my book is out, I’ll close myself up for a little bit.You mentioned attacks from enemies: that’s expected. But attacks from within the community might be less expected for some people.“Attacks” is probably too strong a word. But when I first started receiving hard criticism from the LGBTIQA+ community, it hurt so much more.You can never please everyone, even if ostensibly you’re on the same side.Absolutely. But at the end of the postal survey, I understand that being an almost self-appointed spokesperson for our community’s issues and having a public profile means I might get reported in the media as a spokesperson for a community. So it’s not only fair but right that I’m criticised and held accountable.That’s a healthy way of looking at it. For a lot of people, it’s really challenging to get any criticism. Our immediate reaction is defensiveness.Especially when it’s criticism about work that’s taken so long and required your blood, sweat and tears. It’s hard. But if I’m not getting criticism, I’m not progressing the conversation around our rights and the legislative reform we need.Say you could go back in time and go back to little Sally Rugg and give her advice about her burgeoning queerness, what would you tell her?I’d tell her to stop having sex with men to try to figure out who she is. I’m surprised I didn’t get pregnant! And I’d tell her to try to find her community. Had I found a queer community sooner, I would’ve known I had the belonging and unconditional love of the community as chosen family.• This is an edited extract from Growing Up Queer in Australia edited by Benjamin Law (Black Inc, $29.99)"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3972952.1564572254!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"that new car smell and other consumer enigmas","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDoes a new car  really smell good or do you just think it does?

Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe Government is taking over too much control of the third-level education system and is frequently ignoring the expertise of State advisory bodies, according to the former chief executive of the Higher Education Authority (HEA).In his first public comments since resigning as HEA chief executive last year, Dr Graham Love has expressed concern at how the authority’s work has been marginalised.In an opinion article in The , he writes that the authority is the national advisory body on higher education and its role is to develop higher education policy and provide advice to the Minister.“In my experience, the HEA’s advice was often ignored by the department, in some cases was unwelcome and sometimes the agency was actively discouraged from developing advice in the first place,” Dr Love writes.During his time as chief executive, he says the publication of sensitive reports – such as the international panel review of teacher education – were delayed by more than a year.In another case, the department took over the development of a system performance framework to measure the performance of third-level institutions and sidelined the authority.“What is the point of having a specialist agency, conferring functions upon it and then ignoring or discouraging its advice?” he writes.Dr Love says best practice in public service usually reserves policy-setting for Government departments and policy implementation for their agencies. “Since the recession I have observed an increasing tendency of Government departments to pull operational matters back under their control,” he writes.“As examples, the way in which capital funding and funding for under-represented students in higher education is allocated is tightly controlled by the Department of Education and Skills. There is a thin veneer of HEA involvement, but the important decisions take place in Marlborough Street. This must stop.”His comments follow the publication of the department’s plan to reform the governance of third-level education.They include replacing the authority with a new Higher Education Commission (HEC), along with new powers to carry out reviews into the performance of third-level collegesDr Love said many of the changes in the planned legislation were worthwhile and would give greater powers to the authority. However, he warned that the new commission would need to be “able to do its job”. IndependenceSeparately, Trinity College Dublin’s provost, Patrick Prendergast, has warned that Government plans to reform the governance of third-level education run the risk of curtailing universities’ independence.During an interview with The  in Cape Town, where the college is seeking to forge closer links with other universities, Mr Prendergast said he believed one of the great strengths of the Irish higher education system was its independence.“We value that highly,” he said. “We realise that we have to be responsible for public money when we get it. Absolutely we are accountable for that. But we think independence of the university systems is very important.”When asked if the new legislation could curtail universities’ independence, Mr Prendergast replied: “well, that is the risk”.“Take away autonomy take away freedom for decision-making about how best to use our funds, then we could easily damage the university system, so we have to be very conscious not to do that.”The department said in a statement last month that its reform plans would not undermine the autonomy of universities.In a statement, it said they would have “no implications for the vital principle of academic freedom which is fully protected by the existing legislative framework for higher education”.Mr Prendergast went on to say he did not think there was intention to curtail university autonomy, “so let’s work collaboratively together to ensure that the regulatory environment that we have in Ireland promotes improvement, further development and the global competitiveness of our universities, and not the opposite.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3977820.1565027359!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nuns exit muckross park after 120 trailblazing years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSixth-year students at Muckross Park College on their last day of school alongside nuns from the Dominican conventSome 120 years after they established one of the best known girls’ schools in the capital, the last remaining Dominican nuns have left the Muckross Park campus in Dublin 4.For staff and past pupils, there has been sadness at the departure of the nuns and the closure of the convent building in Donnybrook.But there have also been glowing tributes to the legacy of “pioneers” and “trailblazers” who quietly pushed the boundaries of education for young women of the time.“If you look at the roll-call of students in the early years, there were suffragists, there were campaigners for all the social issues of the times and champions of education,” says Deirdre Mac Mathúna, a history teacher at Muckross Park College and president of the History Teachers’ Association of Ireland.“There was an attitude of, ‘Why shouldn’t young women become scientists, engineers, doctors, lawyers or teachers?’ It was a case of giving them the opportunity to be who they were meant to be.”Historical records show science was on the curriculum of the girls’ school in the early 1900s, at a time when the subject was only available in boys’ schools.It was also a time when women were allowed to sit university exams but, in a classic Catch-22, were not allowed to attend lectures.The nuns organised lecturers for female undergraduates at the school – establishing St Mary’s University College on the grounds – which ended up producing graduates such as suffragette Hanna Sheehy Skeffington.“If you can’t join them, outmanoeuvre them, seems to have been the philosophy,” says Breda O’Brien, a teacher of religious education and English at Muckross Park College and an  columnist.Profound commitmentMany recall nuns who could be tough and unsentimental, but who also showed a profound commitment to educating women.Among the roll-call of nuns through the years was Sr Barnabas, or “Barny”, as she was known to staff and students.She organised driving lessons in the 1960s for sixth-years, part of a plan to make young women independent, participating citizens. She is also said to have promoted sex education long before it was mandatory.Sr Benvenuta, a historian who taught at the school for a time, ended up playing a key role in writing women back into Irish history. Also well-known as Margaret MacCurtain, her work formed part of the second wave of the feminist movement in Ireland in the late 1960s.When she was researching a religious figure for her PhD, the then-Dublin archbishop John Charles McQuaid is said to have demanded to see her thesis and notes prior to publication. The response was a firm “no”.Staff also say there was a strong sense of social justice and a determination to provide education to the wider community.While many religious schools in south Dublin opted not to join the free education scheme in the late 1960s, Muckross entered it immediately.“The Dominicans were one of the first to say, ‘we’re going to join,’” says the principal of Muckross Park College, Anne Marie Mee.“It was a case of allowing their role as educators to be available as wide as possible. It was beyond class . . . It speaks volumes about their desire to make education available to all.”Close associationWhile the last nun left the teaching staff in the early 2000s, the school has continued to have a close association with the convent.Sr Norah, a former principal, is still the school’s chaplain, while the sixth-year girls have had a traditional final-day breakfast in the convent, along with a graduation mass in the chapel.The 11 remaining nuns on the campus included former teaching staff who, say teachers, have been contributing to school life.“These are women in their 80s who might as well be in their 40s,” says O’Brien. “They have email accounts, iPads. Education is their mission. They never stopped educating themselves and are just as interested now in what is going on in the school.”With the closure of the convent and the departure of the nuns to other Dominican communities, there is uncertainty over whether the grounds will be sold (see below).Sr Bríd Rowe of the Congregation of Dominican Sisters in Cabra declined to comment on the future of the site, except to say that it was a moment of heartbreak for many of the nuns.“We hope there will still be plenty of contact with the Dominican Sisters. Although we won’t be on-site, we will still be within easy reach.”Whatever happens, the school’s principal is hopeful the school ethos will continue.“It’s been very emotional for all of us. We’ve had the last carol service and the last graduation service.“It was heartening to see the young staff and pupils so engaged and moved by it all . . . there is a belief that we have something good here that is worth bringing into the future.”Convent lands located in prime real estate territoryThe Dominican Sisters have declined to say whether they will place the convent and surrounding lands at Muckross Park in Donnybrook, Dublin 4, up for sale.The lands on Marlborough Road – sold to the Dominicans just over 120 years ago for £4,000 – are likely to be worth tens of millions of euro.Sr Bríd Rowe of the Congregation of Dominican Sisters in Cabra confirmed that the convent building on the site had closed but declined to say what its future plans were for the site.The site includes a listed convent building – built by the family of Joseph Mary Plunkett – and a chapel built in the 1940s.Muckross Park College, the girls’ secondary school, will be unaffected if the land is sold. However, it would lose access to the chapel which it uses for ceremonial occasions.The school’s portion of the campus was transferred into the hands of the Le Chéile schools trust a decade ago.Similarly, St Mary’s National School, which adjoins the site, will not be affected.In recent years, the Dominicans sold a part of the site to the Department of Education for a new building for the primary school.Planning permission was granted earlier this year for the demolition of the UCD Muckross Halls building and the erection of a temporary two-storey school comprising 12 classrooms on the site.Religious orders have been selling large tracts land across the city over recent months.The Carmelite order is set to secure up to €35 million from the sale of eight acres of land attached to its student and novitiate house at Ballinteer in south Dublin, while the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin and GAA are selling lands in Drumcondra worth up to €100 million.A combination of declining congregational memberships, property values and the cost of caring for the elderly are among the factors cited as being behind some of the land deals.Sr Rowe said the closure of the convent was an occasion of “great sadness” but it was necessary to move the remaining sisters to more suitable accommodation.“That is why this is happening. It has been a worry to us for some time. So, we had to come to that very sad decision,”she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3977888.1565033588!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"building on dublin bay could help the environment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSandymount Strand: Ireland would fail to address climate change problems if it continued to allow Dublin to sprawl outwards, said RIAI president David Browne. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Reclaiming Dublin Bay would help Ireland meet its climate targets, as well a providing much-needed housing for the city’s growing population, David Browne, president of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, has said.The Government’s Project Ireland 2040 plan, which aims to guide sustainable development, was not adequate, said Mr Browne, who is a director of RKD Architects.“We need to be taking a longer view than the Government is taking in project 2040. We have to think and plan much further than the next 20 years. We have to imagine where the city is going to be, not where it is now.”Ireland would fail to address climate change problems if it continued to allow Dublin to sprawl outwards instead of creating greater density in the city area, he said.“We need long-term planning now with a roadmap for sustainable city development to 2070,” he said. “We know we have a window of about 12 years to address climate change, but we can’t do that if we continue to allow sprawl to erode agricultural land, with development densities that are too low.”The new Poolbeg strategic development zone, centred on the former Irish Glass Bottle Company site right beside Sandymount Strand, is already designated for apartments for more than 8,000 people, and construction has yet to start. However, Mr Browne said this development will serve only to meet immediate housing needs, while reclaiming and building on Sandymount Strand and the Tolka estuary could provide enough homes for 150,000 people.“There is nowhere else for the city to go. At the moment we have the docklands under construction, but that is almost finished. Then there will be Poolbeg, but again that will be built out in a few years . There are vacant sites between the canals, but they are very patchy and they don’t offer the potential we need.”Waterside livingA new, planned, Dublin Bay neighbourhood would offer people the attractions of waterside living, close to the city in environmentally sustainable neighbourhoods.“I would envisage a mix of 80 per cent residential and 20 per cent commercial based of the principal of the ‘five-minute neighbourhood’, with civic quarters that have self-contained amenities within a five-minute walk,” he said.“We need to convince the public how much more attractive urban living is, than living in an isolated place where the only option is to get into your car. It’s been done in Copenhagen. Building beside the water creates a really enjoyable urban space you can spend your whole life in.”Developing Sandymount Strand would allow more value to be derived from the rail line, which was “one sided”, with development only to the west after the Merrion gates. It would also protect homes in Sandymount, many of which were at or below sea level, from flooding.Mr Browne points out that Dublin’s existing docks and most of the eastern side of the city centre is on reclaimed land, and modern engineering solutions, including building up the level of land, would protect the new development from flooding.‘Construction waste’“Reclaiming land in Dublin is nothing new. What we need to do is build up the level of the land. You could go out to the Kish bank and bring in sand in a pipe and spray it on. It would take two or three years to build it up to the level needed. Another approach would be to use the huge amount of construction waste in the area. Obviously it would have to be screened.”The environmental impact of the scheme would have to be assessed, he said.“There would be many environmental issues to be thought about. There are of course special areas of conservation and special protection areas that have to be considered. But if it could be shown to be viable environmentally, socially it could be an enormous asset to the city.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3977831.1565027909!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"over 1 700 affordable homes to be built on council sites","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Department of Housing says 1,770 affordable homes will be delivered out of a total of 6,200 affordable homes planned under the services fund. Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe BloombergMore than 1,700 affordable homes will be built as part of an €84 million package to deliver infrastructure on local authority sites, Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy has said.Mr Murphy said the Government had agreed to provide a second tranche of funding to 25 projects around the State under the “serviced sites fund” which supports the delivery of infrastructure on local authority sites.The projects given the green light are in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Kilkenny, Limerick, Waterford, Wicklow and Wexford. The Department of Housing says 1,770 affordable homes will be delivered as a result of the funding, out of a total of 6,200 affordable homes planned under the services fund.“We’ve seen recently that house prices have been cooling down, even falling in some parts of the country as supply increases. But for too many people home ownership still remains out of reach,” Mr Murphy said.“Unless the Government steps in to bridge the gap, young couples and workers may not be able to afford to buy their own home in our cities and large towns. That’s why we are using local authority land to build more affordable homes for young workers and couples, and that’s why these approvals announced today are so important. “The market will not fix our housing problems alone the Government must lead on providing more affordable homes.”Rebuilding Ireland planThe serviced sites fund has a total of €310 million available out to 2021 as part of the Rebuilding Ireland plan. Mr Murphy said the eventual aim was to build 10,000 affordable homes as part of the same scheme.“Housing, and in particular affordable housing, is one of the critical challenges facing our country. That is why I sought and achieved a trebling of the serviced sites fund in last year’s budget, to provide €310 million to get local authority sites up and running to deliver at least 6,200 affordable homes, working towards a programme of 10,000, where they are most needed. My department will now work with local authorities to develop these proposals and bring the plans to fruition.”Speaking in June, Mr Murphy admitted the first tranche of homes would not be built until next year.He said the “overall cost and timing of delivery for these projects is contingent upon the completion of planning and procurement in the first instance, and local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible, with the first tranche of affordable homes expected to be delivered next year”.Selected by picture editor Frank Miller"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3977869.1565032282!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sandymount strand housing plan public reaction","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWalkers on Sandymount Strand: Building in scenic natural areas like Sandymount Strand, before using unused land further inland, was heavily criticised.

They’d be digging in their heels.”Róisín Murphy from Ballsbridge agreed. “People would be really unhappy about that happening here.”Building in scenic natural areas like Sandymount Strand, before using unused land further inland, was heavily criticised.“There are so many other areas they could do it without ruining this area,” said Gemma Carroll of Glasnevin. “It seems like they’re going for the natural places, when there are lots of areas that are not being developed that should be more inland.

Photograph: Eric Luke Ireland achieved “significant improvements” to European copyright reforms to “allay the concerns” of Google and other major technology firms, a Minister told the online search giant earlier this year.Minister for Business, Employment and Innovation Heather Humphreys made the remarks in a phone call with a senior Google executive about new European laws on copyright.While advocates say the laws protect the future of professional journalism and combat misinformation, several major tech companies including Google lobbied against their introduction.During the call, Kent Walker, a senior vice-president with Google, outlined “key concerns” about the latest text of the European Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, which was adopted earlier this year.In response, a record of the call shows Ms Humphreys “noted the significant improvements to the text that have been achieved by Ireland to allay the concerns of platforms, including Google”.The Minister went on to state the proposal from Brussels was about balance between stakeholders and protecting “rightsholders” – usually publishers – “and that Ireland had already been successful in reducing the burden on platforms and sharing it better with rightholders”.Under the directive, which was approved by the EU parliament in March, Google, YouTube, Facebook and others will have to sign licensing agreements with musicians, authors, news publishers and others in order to use their work. Directive Among the concerns raised by Google with Ms Humphreys related to an article of the directive which will force services such as Google News to take out licenses with publishers and newspapers to show short snippets of text. Tech firms also opposed article 13 of the directive, which would make the Google-owned YouTube legally responsible for user-generated material hosted on its platform. Google opposed this reform, and the company also raised this issue with the Minister. The record of the call states that the Monaghan TD “noted Ireland’s agreement on the need for sufficient information” on article 13 and “indicated that we can make the point” in relation to issues arising under article 11.Angela Mills Wade, executive director of the European Publishers Council, told The  that “nobody involved in, or close to, the negotiations will be surprised at this level of access and influence – not to mention the apparent desire of the Government to please Google”.Ms Mills Wade, who campaigned in favour of the directive, said that while lobbying is part of the democratic process, she bemoaned “the surprising but also disappointing gullibility of some parties and even governments who bought the Google narrative without any proper analysis of what was really at stake, not least the long-term sustainability of an independent free press, and the livelihood of millions of iniduals whether freelance or employed”. She said the campaign was characterised by disinformation and scaremongering from big tech firms. A spokeswoman for the Department of Business said the government negotiates EU legislation “acting in the best interests of Ireland and the Irish public”.She said in developing Ireland’s position on the copyright directive, the department “encouraged and welcomed input from all stakeholders to help achieve a balanced approach. This included the receipt of input during the period of the negotiations from a wide range of stakeholders including digital platforms, such as Google, and press publishers”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3977687.1565018813!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"overspend on pay rises and pensions costs 1 5bn","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBarry Cowen, Fianna Fáil’s public spending spokesman, said the scale of overspending shows Fine Gael ‘can no longer lecture anyone on fiscal matters’.  Photograph: iStock The three worst government departments for keeping to their budget have blamed pay rises, pensions and Christmas allowances for overspends costing the taxpayer more than €1.5 billion over the last three years. The Department of Health ran up €850 million in surplus spending, over and above its original budgets, in 2017 and 2018, latest figures released by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe show.The department cited compensation pay-outs as a significant factor. The Department of Education’s overspend reached €442 million over the past three years, while the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection needed supplementary budgets totalling €258 million over the same period. Department of Housing overruns tipped €230 million while the Garda ran up €113 million in excess spending. The figures were disclosed in response to a parliamentary question by Fine Gael TD Bernard Durkan, who asked Mr Donohoe about the extent to which government departments “have disregarded public expenditure requirements” since 2016. Mr Donohoe said the need for supplementary estimates can arise for a number of reasons, including policy decisions, timing issues and overspends.Health spending has continued to escalate above budget limits, prompting concerns in the Department of Public Expenditure that greater control is needed within the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. Latest figures from the Department of Health show a financial deficit in the HSE of just under €170 million at the end of May this year.Barry Cowen, Fianna Fáil’s public spending spokesman, said the scale of overspending shows Fine Gael “can no longer lecture anyone on fiscal matters”. Spending ceilings“Despite what they would like us to believe, the facts show a different story,” he said. Mr Cowen said the spending ceilings introduced by 2014 are “meaningless” because the Government “simply ignores them”.Despite huge overspending in areas such as health, the country “is not seeing any tangible benefit on the ground”, he added.A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said it was given €450 million in additional funding in 2017, before getting a further €195 million in “supplementary” spending. More than €175 million of its initial additional funding went on pay and pension costs while €27 million was taken up by cases before the State Claims Agency (SCA), she said. Of the €195 million “supplementary” overspend the same year, €75 million went towards the “acceleration of the restoration of pay under the Lansdowne Road Agreement” while another €50 million was needed for the SCA. For 2018, 45 per cent of the additional funding provided for in the budget was needed for pay restoration which resulted in “a very modest increase for services, and the consequent need for a further supplementary estimate”.“When account is taken of pay restoration, costs associated with the SCA and other demand-led areas, there is a reason for the level of increased expenditure year on year,” the spokeswoman said.“Further, the nature of the health service is such that the normal budget management levers available to other sectors, such as reduction of services, are simply not available to us and consequently, overruns can and do occur.”Additional expenditureThe Department of Education said its need for additional expenditure over the past three years was “primarily related to the funding of pensions, which was a public sector-wide issue”. There was also €72 million needed for “contingency provisions related to the treatment and timing of receipts, rather than expenditure”, a spokesman said.

The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection said it restored the payment of a Christmas bonus to long-term social welfare recipients over recent years. The cost was not included in the revised estimates as the decision to pay the bonus in any particular year is made in the October budget, said a spokeswoman. “The respective costs of the Christmas bonus in the years 2016-2018 was €220 million, €219 million and €260 million,” she added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3977846.1565029859!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sf leader rejects o toole s no deal brexit plan as a non runner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald: ‘Does anyone seriously think that we will stop Boris Johnson on a technicality? Photograph:  Charles McQuillan Getty ImagesSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has described a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit which would involve the party’s seven MPs standing down as a “a total non-runner”.Fine Gael TDs and Senators have now said the idea should be considered in light of the serious implications that a no-deal scenario would have for Ireland.Debate on the proposal has been generated by a column by  writer Fintan O’Toole, the idea being that the seven Sinn Féin MPs would stand down temporarily, triggering elections. If the writs are moved on September 3rd when parliament returns from its summer recess, the elections could be held by the end of the month.The four main parties would agree a candidate for each constituency who is not politically aligned. They would support all measures to stop a no-deal Brexit and stand down as soon as Brexit is either accomplished or aborted. They would respect Sinn Féin’s policy of abstention on all issues except the ones that relate to Brexit.Ms McDonald said the suggestion was “unworkable”.“We published proposals which set out the need for designated special status within the EU, much of which is reflected in the current backstop, we went on a diplomatic offensive internationally, worked as part of a pro-Remain alliance in the North and also alongside the Irish Government. We will continue to stand up for Ireland’s interests.“As October and the increasing likelihood of a hard Brexit gets closer, we will undoubtedly see more commentators grasp at straws and try to find a loophole which will stop Boris Johnson and the Tories from proceeding with Brexit. This is not real politik does anyone seriously think that we will stop Boris Johnson on a technicality?“Fintan O’Toole’s suggestion is a total non-runner and it is unworkable in the real world. More worryingly, it would only heighten the political crisis and farce at Westminster and strengthen Boris Johnson’s hand. The focus needs to stay on delivering the backstop and not fantasy politics.“If we are faced with the scenario of a no-deal Brexit and the undermining of the Good Friday Agreement, then the people of the North should be given an opportunity to vote for which union they want to be part of in a unity referendum,” she said.Sinn Féin TD and health spokesman Louise O’Reilly said the suggestion was “unviable and potentially destabilising”.‘Imaginative’But Fine Gael senator Neale Richmond said the proposal was “an imaginative one”.“Every party and person must do all they can to assist in averting this it is not good for Sinn Féin to sit on the sidelines when they can make a meaningful difference in a Westminster parliament where the government has a majority of just one.“If they won’t take their seats, perhaps they should indeed step aside and let others who really care about this island’s future step up,” he said.Fine Gael TD Noel Rock said the plan was “innovative” and represented “outside-the-box thinking”.“The practicality might be a little trickier, not least because the byelections to replace the Sinn Féin MPs would likely all be contested and some could well fall to pro-Brexit candidates.”Fianna Fáil MEP Billy Kelleher said he believed Sinn Féin should take up their seats at Westminster and vote only on Brexit issues that affect the island of Ireland.He said the proposal itself was “a non-runner for many reasons including the logistics and the reality of politics but primarily because Sinn Féin only ever thinks of what is in their strategic interests”.Fine Gael TD Alan Farrell said he believed Sinn Féin was “squandering an opportunity to work in the best interests of their constituents and Ireland as a whole by continuing to boycott the Houses of Parliament”.“If ever there was a time for them to take up their seats then surely the threat of the untold consequences of Brexit is it.”However, he said the idea that they should give up their seats was “an interesting proposition but not one that is based in our political reality”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3977684.1565016466!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cashless society improves community resilience in somaliland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn the village of Jir Jir in Somaliland, shopkeeper Roble Barkad accepts cashless payments confirmed by text. Photograph: Gavin DouglasSomaliland is a place of contrasts: most people don’t have a toilet or a water tap they have to boil water (which they have to buy) before consuming it yet most have a mobile phone, even in the most remote locations.In camps and settlements, homes vary from igloo-shaped huts with cloth covering to shacks made from corrugated iron. In cities the mix is similar but with the odd brick house and larger home surrounded by high walls and lookout posts for armed security guards.Amid the homesteads you will find the odd solar PV panel, a little bigger than a book, which recharges mobiles and, if lucky, provides some basic lighting. Occasionally, there is even the odd TV satellite dish. But the ubiquity of the mobile phone stands out, and it has become a lifeline in more ways than one.In the village of Jir Jir, a few tiny shops selling agricultural products and basic foodstuffs, soft drinks and sweets line the single street. Shopkeeper Roble Barkad demonstrates how easy and quick going cashless is.A purchaser indicates what he wants to buy, texts an identifier and the agreed amount (US dollars or Somali shillings) followed by a hashtag. He accepts the payment, which is confirmed by text. Almost half of 350 households located nearby benefit from cash support via electronic transfer.Business is good. He has a small freezer (a rare sight), a mobile charging service using a car battery, while LED bulbs light up the premises and shelves are dominated by sachets of vegetable oil and bottles of Coca-Cola.The broader benefits are spelled out by Alessandro Bini, director of Somali Cash Consortium. It is supported by development organisations, with Concern Worldwide acting as lead. The system, which is free to use, emerged following the 2017 drought and a European Union wish to provide what is called “a safety net”. It ensures people survive in the short term by way of unconditional support, while also having sufficient funds for longer-term needs.Bini describes it as “a social protection system”, usable for education, health and disability payments – some $18 million was disbursed by the consortium in 2018.“It overcomes security risks and efficiently delivers aid to those who need it most with families sharing a mobile phone,” he says.In effect, sim cards are used as a type of bank account. Known places such as markets or village shops are equipped to receive payment by mobile phone, and sometimes to dispense cash. People have what might regarded as a primitive existence, yet it is a practically cashless society – with a highly efficient system that could be deployed in any European country.Bini says the consortium hopes the system, which is an excellent way to directly support communities where there is no banking, will be taken over by the government to support long-term development rather than just short-term humanitarian aid."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3977662.1565015390!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"somaliland a profile","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSahra Mohamed and Marya Abdulah get drinking water from the Concern and Echo-funded water catchment tank in northern Somaliland. Photograph: Gavin Douglas Concern WorldwideSomaliland is a region in the north of Somali with its own government and ambitions for statehood. The former British protectorate received independence in 1960. Five days after gaining sovereignty, it united with the Italian-colonised Somali to the south. After 31 years it declared independence at the same time as the dictatorship of Siad Barre fell in 2001.Since then, it has had six presidential and local council elections based on the one-person, one-vote principle. It has seen peaceful transitions the handing over of power from one group of clans to another in stark contrast to other east African neighbours and the rest of Somali.It has its own functioning political, judiciary (though Sharia law applies in some rural areas), law enforcement, a police force and an army. It has its own currency though the US dollar has supremacy.Nomadic populationIt has an estimated population growth rate of 1.3 per cent 55 per cent of the 3.5 million population have either a nomadic or semi-nomadic existence, with the remainder living in urban centres or rural towns. Average life expectancy for women is 55 years 50 years for men.Somaliland has been relatively calm since independence unlike south and central Somalia where the al-Qaeda-linked extremist group al-Shabaab has had a destabilising influence.Somaliland’s relative calmness can be marred by “sub clan” conflicts over territories in some regions, notably with neighbouring Puntland, and fighting over water points. Concern Worldwide has operations in three regions. Outside the capital Hargeisa, all movements of international staff require an armed escort by a special government unit call SPU.While Somaliland is among the poorest countries in the world, it has proven reserves of oil and natural gas. Concerns about the potential political volatility, combined with uncertainties around the country’s unrecognised statehood and the protection that can be given, most major international energy companies remain hesitant to embark on any big investment project in Somaliland."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Key figures in Manson case: Cult disciples, rich and famousNorth Korea fires more projectiles as nuclear talks stallUS faces challenges in stopping domestic terror attacksFathers\u0026#39 stress during pregnancy leads to child behavioural problems, study findsRecord number of adults pay no tax - as top one per cent of earners shoulder quarter of tax burden, study revealsSearch warrant on soldier falsely accused of being a paedophile by \u0026#39Nick\u0026#39 should never have been issued, it emerges\u0026#39MAGA bomber\u0026#39 Cesar Sayoc jailed for 20 yearsNo-deal Brexit now expected from Boris Johnson as Dominic Cummings sets \u0026#3948 hour\u0026#39 Whitehall exit plans deadline in shock to EUPrince Harry wishes Silver Spitfire pilots luck on \u0026#39audacious\u0026#39 round-the-world mission, admitting \u0026#39more than a tinge of jealousy\u0026#39Up to 30 Labour MPs are prepared to vote for a Brexit deal if Boris Johnson secures fresh concessionsComment: Opening our arms to the world\u0026#39s most brilliant people will prove Brexit isn\u0026#39t about pulling up the drawbridgeBoy racer destroys £500,000 worth of supercars after speeding through Chelsea street and flipping vehicleHeathrow passengers demand compensation for \u0026#39ghost flights\u0026#39 after workers call off strike at last minuteRetiring police could be offered pension incentives to stay on in bid to hit 20,000 officer targetBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson says \u0026#39last thing\u0026#39 he wants is general election as MPs told they cannot block no-deal Brexit Nicola Sturgeon: My pain and anguish at separation from Alex SalmondTottenham murder: Police arrest man after 89-year-old pensioner killed in suspected burglary at her homeHow India\u0026#39s actions in Kashmir could spark a new war with PakistanBritish Airways flight makes emergency landing in Valencia after cabin \u0026#39filled with smoke\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"best telegraph audio boris first 100 days 5g future","story":"Every Friday the  will bring you a selection of our best articles, comment pieces and features in audio form to be listened to at your convenience.This week saw Boris Johnson enter No 10, and promptly embark on a speedy cull of Theresa May\u0027s cabinet.Our associate editor Camilla Tominey analyses what the new PM\u0027s appointments tell us about his plans for the country.While Daniel Capurro looks at what Mr Johnson\u0027s first 100 days in office could look like.Elsewhere, the Technology Intelligence team discussed what 5G means for the future of city surveillance and Julia Bradshaw looked at who actually owns the North Sea\u0027s oil and gas.Here are this week\u0027s recordings:To listen,  click the \u0027play\u0027 button of the recording you wish to listen to.Who owns the North Sea\u0027s oil and gas?Who owns the North Sea\u0026#039s oil and gas?Analysis: What the new cabinet tells us about Boris Johnson\u0027s premiership Analysis: What the new cabinet tells us about Boris Johnson\u0026#039s premiership NOA  The first 100 days: What can Boris Johnson get done?Boris first 100 days NOADystopia or Utopia: will 5G pave the way for increased city surveillance?5G: dystopia or utopia?

He stopped to swap backpacks on a boat in mid-Channel, which took no more than two minutes. The 40-year-old’s first attempt had ended in failure when he tumbled into the sea while trying to refuel last month. This time, the refuelling boat was bigger and the landing area was larger.Frenchman who has spent years developing a jet-powered hoverboard will again try to zoom across the English Channel on August 4The French maritime authorities granted permission to keep the boat in French waters, which they had refused to do last time, citing safety concerns. Mr Zapata had blamed that decision for his initial failure.This time he was escorted by three helicopters while French navy ships kept an eye out in case of mishaps on one of the world’s busiest shipping routes.“There were no problems,” he said after reaching the picturesque bay where dozens of supporters and journalists were waiting.“Thanks so much to my team, and my wife,” said the former jet ski champion and army reservist from Marseille.“For the last five or six kilometres I just really enjoyed it. Whether this is a historic event or not, I’m not the one to decide that, time will tell. We made a machine three years ago… and now we’ve crossed the Channel.”Breaking into tears of joy, he added: “It’s crazy.”Franky Zapata stands on his jet-powered \u0026#34flyboard\u0026#34 next to helicopters as he arrives at St. Margaret\u0026#39s Bay in Dover, on August 4, 2019His team had been racing to repair his “Flyboard” after it was damaged when he crashed 10 days ago. Before his successful crossing, Mr Zapata said he feared that the hoverboard might develop “a little problem” as there had been no time to put it through prolonged tests, which he would normally have done before “a big event”.The weather was perfect, with a calm sea, hardly any wind and temperatures just above 25 degrees C. Mr Zapata hopes his device will eventually be used as a revolutionary piece of military equipment. “We created a new way of flying,” he said. “We don’t use wings. You are like a bird. It is your body that’s flying. It is a boyhood dream. We want to follow a little bit in the footsteps of the pioneers of aviation.”North Korea fires more projectiles as nuclear talks stallUS faces challenges in stopping domestic terror attacksFathers\u0026#39 stress during pregnancy leads to child behavioural problems, study findsRecord number of adults pay no tax - as top one per cent of earners shoulder quarter of tax burden, study revealsSearch warrant on soldier falsely accused of being a paedophile by \u0026#39Nick\u0026#39 should never have been issued, it emerges\u0026#39MAGA bomber\u0026#39 Cesar Sayoc jailed for 20 yearsNo-deal Brexit now expected from Boris Johnson as Dominic Cummings sets \u0026#3948 hour\u0026#39 Whitehall exit plans deadline in shock to EUPrince Harry wishes Silver Spitfire pilots luck on \u0026#39audacious\u0026#39 round-the-world mission, admitting \u0026#39more than a tinge of jealousy\u0026#39Up to 30 Labour MPs are prepared to vote for a Brexit deal if Boris Johnson secures fresh concessionsComment: Opening our arms to the world\u0026#39s most brilliant people will prove Brexit isn\u0026#39t about pulling up the drawbridgeBoy racer destroys £500,000 worth of supercars after speeding through Chelsea street and flipping vehicleHeathrow passengers demand compensation for \u0026#39ghost flights\u0026#39 after workers call off strike at last minuteRetiring police could be offered pension incentives to stay on in bid to hit 20,000 officer targetBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson says \u0026#39last thing\u0026#39 he wants is general election as MPs told they cannot block no-deal Brexit Nicola Sturgeon: My pain and anguish at separation from Alex SalmondTottenham murder: Police arrest man after 89-year-old pensioner killed in suspected burglary at her homeHow India\u0026#39s actions in Kashmir could spark a new war with PakistanBritish Airways flight makes emergency landing in Valencia after cabin \u0026#39filled with smoke\u0026#39Comment: Why would you let a mentally ill person buy a machine gun?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 5 august 2019","story":"Bright colourful rhododendrons in front of Whitburn Windmill on a bright summer day in Sunderland.

However, it took more than a year of legal wrangling before the initiative could come into force.Jimmy Jansson, a Social Democrat local councillor in Eskilstuna, said the law would help the vulnerable and homeless by bringing them into closer contact with the authorities and social services.“We’ll see where this goes,” he said. “This is not about harassing vulnerable people but trying to address the bigger question: whether we think begging should be normalised within the Swedish welfare model,” Mr Jannson told the Aftonbladet newspaper.“I hear a lot of criticism of any attempts to regulate begging, but I don’t see the same strength and energy directed at the fact that people are forced to beg in the first place.”Some beggars have tried to sidestep the licensing scheme by selling blueberries.So far, according to the state broadcaster SVT, eight applications have been received and three other unlicensed beggars have been moved on by the police.Key figures in Manson case: Cult disciples, rich and famousNorth Korea fires more projectiles as nuclear talks stallUS faces challenges in stopping domestic terror attacksFathers\u0026#39 stress during pregnancy leads to child behavioural problems, study findsRecord number of adults pay no tax - as top one per cent of earners shoulder quarter of tax burden, study revealsSearch warrant on soldier falsely accused of being a paedophile by \u0026#39Nick\u0026#39 should never have been issued, it emerges\u0026#39MAGA bomber\u0026#39 Cesar Sayoc jailed for 20 yearsNo-deal Brexit now expected from Boris Johnson as Dominic Cummings sets \u0026#3948 hour\u0026#39 Whitehall exit plans deadline in shock to EUPrince Harry wishes Silver Spitfire pilots luck on \u0026#39audacious\u0026#39 round-the-world mission, admitting \u0026#39more than a tinge of jealousy\u0026#39Up to 30 Labour MPs are prepared to vote for a Brexit deal if Boris Johnson secures fresh concessionsComment: Opening our arms to the world\u0026#39s most brilliant people will prove Brexit isn\u0026#39t about pulling up the drawbridgeBoy racer destroys £500,000 worth of supercars after speeding through Chelsea street and flipping vehicleHeathrow passengers demand compensation for \u0026#39ghost flights\u0026#39 after workers call off strike at last minuteRetiring police could be offered pension incentives to stay on in bid to hit 20,000 officer targetBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson says \u0026#39last thing\u0026#39 he wants is general election as MPs told they cannot block no-deal Brexit Nicola Sturgeon: My pain and anguish at separation from Alex SalmondTottenham murder: Police arrest man after 89-year-old pensioner killed in suspected burglary at her homeHow India\u0026#39s actions in Kashmir could spark a new war with PakistanBritish Airways flight makes emergency landing in Valencia after cabin \u0026#39filled with smoke\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/07/21/10/ruby-rose.jpg","title":"batwoman ruby rose lgbt lesbian cw orange is the new black","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsRuby Rose is playing the first out lesbian superhero in new CW seriesClick to followThe Independent CultureBatwoman is set to hit the small screen in October and Ruby Rose will be playing the titular character.As the first out lesbian superhero, this will be\u0026nbspa positive step\u0026nbspforward for the representation of the LGBTQ+ community on television.Rose, a genderfluid lesbian herself, was initially wary of committing to a TV role but gave in as:\u0026nbsp”It’s telling the story that I wish was on television when I was a kid.”She continues:\u0026nbsp”I believe there are going to be people that this changes their life.\u0026nbspWe want everyone to watch this, especially young people, who can identify and relate to people they’re watching on the screen and hopefully be empowered by that.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The best TV shows of 2019 (so far) Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different.

Almost 40 per cent of all food consumed in the UK comes from the EU or from other countries via EU trade deals.Professor Lang warned that Britons, particularly those on lower incomes, already under-consume fresh fruit and vegetables,\u0026nbspand food banks are not fully prepared for shortages, which could have a negative impact on diets and public health.Created with Sketch.The front pages on what would have been Brexit Day Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.March 29 2019 -

They said on Monday they would block administrators from entering the site.“There has been a series of board meetings, the result of which is that administrators will be appointed over the course of the day,” a Harland and Wolff spokesman said.The business was put up for sale last year by Norwegian parent Dolphin Drilling, which filed for bankruptcy in June. The Norwegian administrator of Dolphin Drilling did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.Opened in 1861, Harland and Wolff employed more than 30,000 people in its Second World War heyday and remains a potent symbol of Belfast’s past as an industrial engine of the British Empire.Created with Sketch.Curse of the Titanic: What happened to those who survived?

Almost 40 per cent of all food consumed in the UK comes from the EU or from other countries via EU trade deals.Professor Lang warned that Britons, particularly those on lower incomes, already under-consume fresh fruit and vegetables,\u0026nbspand food banks are not fully prepared for shortages, which could have a negative impact on diets and public health.Created with Sketch.The front pages on what would have been Brexit Day Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.March 29 2019 -

It’s got incredible acting, directing and writing and that’s one I think awards bodies will be paying attention to.Alongside\u0026nbspJordan and Foxx, Bailey predicted that voters will pay attention to Meryl Streep, Joaquin Phoenix and Renee Zellweger.Created with Sketch.The 37 best actors who have never won an Oscar Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jake Gyllenhaal has been nominated for one Oscar – for Brokeback Mountain. And while his performance in that film was certainly worthy of the accolade, you could argue the actor deserved nominations just as much for Nightcrawler, Nocturnal Naimals, Stronger, Prisoners, Enemy, and Donnie Darko. Pam Grier was not only robbed of an Oscar for Quentin Tarantino’s classic thriller Jackie Brown, she was robbed of a nomination full stop. Conversely, her co-star Robert Forster picked up a Supporting Actor nomination. Certainly, an oversight from the Academy.Jim Carrey has been nominated for more Grammy Awards than Oscars, having picked up a nomination for Best Spoken Word Album for Children in 2006 for A Series of Unfortunate Events. The academy, sadly, has never given Carrey a fair chance, despite winning over the world in the likes of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Man on the Moon and The Truman Show.Chastain has the aura of an Oscar winner. Somewhere down the line, surely one her roles won her an Oscar? Yet, despite nominations for The Help and Zero Dark, plus stand-out leading roles in films such as Molly’s Game, the actor still does not have a statuette.Of James Dean’s three credited film roles, two were nominated for Oscars – Giant and East of Eden (Rebel Without a Cause was not nominated). Only one of his films, Eden, was released before his tragic passing in 1955.The Academy members should hang their heads in shame for never nominating John Goodman, one of the finest ever character actors, for an award. Considering his brilliant performances in Raising Arizona (1987), Barton Fink (1991), The Big Lebowski (1998), O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) – and those are just his collaborations with the Coen Brothers – he must be wondering what he has to do to be acknowledged by the Academy. Salma Hayek’s career highlight, Frida, came within inches of bringing her an Oscar. Yet, it was not to be – the actor was beaten by Nicole Kidman in The Hours, and Hayak has since been ignored by the Academy.Michelle Pfeiffer was one of the most popular actors working in the 1980s and 1990s, nabbing Oscar nominations for Dangerous Liaisons (1988), The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989) and Love Field (1992). However, as the ceremonies came and went, no victory followed.That Rosario Dawson has become more associated with Superheroes than awards is a tragedy. Her roles in Rent, 25th Hour and Sin City have won her praise from critics and fans alike, but there’s still not an Oscar or Golden Globe mention on her IMDB page.You\u0027d think that Angela Lansbury, having won five Tony Awards and six Golden Globes, would have at least one Oscar at home. Not so. Despite her three nominations – for Gaslight (1944), The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945) and The Manchurian Candidate (1962) – the Dame is yet to triumph at the Academy Awards. Oscar Isaac, his many fans argue, was robbed of an Oscar nomination for Inside Llewyn Davis. The critically acclaimed Coen brothers film failed to make the Best Picture cut, and poor Isaac, who played the eponymous struggling folk singer to perfection, was left without a nod. He was also overlooked for Ex Machina and A Most Violent Year.The Princess Bride, Forrest Gump, Moneyball: Robin Wright has consistently left critics and audiences impressed. And while no Oscars have followed, her work on the TV series House of Card has earned her seven primetime Emmy award nominations.Bradley Cooper’s directorial debut, A Star is Born, had won acclaim across the board and looked set for Oscars glory (with a Best Actor award almost within grasp). However, Rami Malek stole victory away from him at the last moment. Perhaps the best run of his career came between 2013 and 2015, when he was nominated for three consecutive acting Oscars: Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle and American Sniper.You would be forgiven for presuming Joaquin Phoenix has an Oscar statuette somewhere at home. Yet the star of The Master, Walk the Line and Gladiator – all for which he was nominated – has no such award lying around. Instead, Phoenix will have to make do with a Golden Globe, a Grammy (for his work on the Walk the Line soundtrack) and a People’s Choice Award.Angela Bassett has had one of the most prolific careers in Hollywood history, starring in dozens of TV shows and films. Her roles in What\u0027s Love Got to Do with It (1993), Malcolm X (1992) and Music of the Heart (1999) won awards elsewhere – but not with the Academy.Sigourney Weaver on the set of the original Alien film in 1979Despite playing multiple roles that seem like certain Oscar winners, David Oyelowo has never even been nominated for an award. His role as Martin Luther King Jr in 2014’s Selma has gone down as one of the biggest snubs in recent history and was one of many incidents that led to the #OscarsSoWhite movement.One of the most iconic actors of all time, Marilyn Monroe never received an Oscar nomination. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) and Some Like It Hot (1959) may have gone down as classics, but Monroe never stood out enough for the Academy.The Big Lebowski, Fargo, Reservoir Dogs, Miller\u0027s Crossing, Con Air, Armageddon, Big Fish, The Death of Stalin and Barton Fink... just several films Steve Buscemi was not nominated for an Oscar for. In fact, Buscemi has never been nominated for an Academy Award.Three Oscar nominations for Woody Harrelson, and three loses for Woody Harrelson – Larry Flynt in The People vs Larry Flynt (1996), The Messenger (2009) and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017). But, like that widely shared Zombieland GIF, Harrelson will be wiping away the tears with a wedge of dollar bills, his films having made more than $3 billion at the box office worldwide.Mia Farrow may have starred in the classics Rosemary’s Baby, Broadway Danny Rose and The Purple Rose of Cairo, but not a single nomination followed. Surprising for someone who has won three Baftas and a Golden Globe.While many people suspected Idris Elba would score an Oscar nomination for Beasts of No Nation, the Academy’s hatred for Netflix proved too strong (Bafta and the Globes nominated him instead). Even other prime Oscar-bait – Molly’s Game, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, Second Coming – failed to land Elba any nominations. No wonder, perhaps, that the actor has stuck primarily to multi-million-dollar blockbusters.Having had acclaimed roles in American History X, Fight Club and Birdman, Edward Norton will no doubt go down as one of America’s most talented actors. Unfortunately, the actor has no Oscars to show it.By starring in both Lost in Translation and Girl with a Pearl Earring, Scarlett Johansson shot herself slightly in the foot in 2003. For the two roles, she landed double Leading Actress nominations at Bafta (winning for Translation) and two Globes nominations. The Oscars? Not one. And despite standout roles in Lucy, Under the Skin, Match Pint, A Love Song for Bobby Long, she still has never been nominated for an Oscar.Samuel L Jackson is one of the most prolific actors working in Hollywood and has one Oscar nomination – for Pulp Fiction (1995). Considering he’s ranked as the highest all-time box office star, having made over $12 billion worldwide, the Avengers actor’s probably not all that upset.GettySamuel L Jackson poses at a portrait session during day three of the 13th annual Dubai International Film FestivalWith four Oscar nominations under her belt, Michelle Williams somehow still has no statuette placed on her mantelpiece. Her closest call came in 2016, when she starred in Manchester By the Sea, when she was up against the supreme Viola Davis, who went on to win the award for Fences.Few actors can attest to being as hardworking as Annette Bening. Revered for her work onstage, she also won acclaim for Oscar-nominated on-screen roles in The Grifters (1990), American Beauty (1999) and The Kids Are Alright (2010). That she was completely overlooked for 20th Century Women in 2017 was a glaring oversight. Kirk Douglas was a leading man in Hollywood’s Golden Age, his roles in Spartacus, Lust for Life and Champion inspiring a generation of actors after him. Still, the actor never won a competitive Oscar – only an honorary one in 1996, for his 50 years in the creative industry.Irene Dunne – nominated five times – is one of the few recipients of the Kennedy Centre Honours for her service to the performing arts. Yet her performances in Cimarron (1931), Theodora Goes Wild (1936), The Awful Truth (1937), Love Affair (1939) and I Remember Mama (1948) all went unrewarded by the Academy.One of the world’s most accomplished character actors, Arthur Kennedy was best known for his supporting roles in films such as Champion (1949), Trial (1955), Peyton Place (1957) and Some Came Running (1958), all of which won him Oscar nods. And despite a leading actor nomination in 1951 for Lights Out, Kennedy still couldn’t manage a win.One of Britain’s premiere Shakespearean actors, Albert Finney was nominated five times across almost four decades, for Tom Jones (1963), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Dresser (1983), Under the Volcano (1984) and Erin Brockovich (2000).Six-time nominee Dame Deborah Kerr famously failed to win for the musical The King and I – losing to Ingrid Bergman in Anastasia. Thankfully, the Academy realised their error years later, awarding Kerr an honorary award and calling her “a dedicated actress whose motion picture career has always stood for perfection, discipline and elegance.Another actor with six nominations and no wins. Even a role in 1950s All About Eve, which would win Best Picture, couldn’t push Thelma Ritter to victory. She went on to be nominated four more times that decade, for The Mating Season (1951, With a Song in My Heart (1952), Pickup on South Street (1953), and Pillow Talk (1959).Another much-nominated actor without a win, Glenn\u0027s most recent Close shave came at the 2019 Oscars, when she was nominated for The Wife. She has previously been nominated six time, including roles in The World According to Garp (1982). Fatal Attraction (1987), and Dangerous Liaisons (1988) .Amy Adams comes just behind Close, with six nominations (including The Fighter, The Master and American Hustle). None of those were for Arrival, the sci-fi film that saw Adams pick up Bafta, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations. Unfortunately, that same year, she was competing against herself in Nocturnal Animals, which likely split the Oscars vote.Richard Burton holds the record for second-most Oscar nominations without a win (seven to Peter O’Toole’s eight). While Burton’s performance in Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is often heralded as his best, the actor lost out to Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons.Peter O\u0027Toole is the Oscar’s most-nominated actor without a win, with eight nods in total. Although the actor did not take home a trophy for Lawrence of Arabia, The Lion in Winter and Goodbye, Mr Chips, O\u0027Toole was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2002.Jake Gyllenhaal has been nominated for one Oscar – for Brokeback Mountain.

These are so-called ‘feasting meats’.“The king would stop over at the manor and entertain guests with huge feasts, and this is where the bones would end up.“There is nothing better for an archaeologist than a rubbish dump.

That followed the capture of an Iranian-owned tanker, Grace 1, by Royal Marines off Gibraltar.Two British frigates in the Gulf, the destroyer HMS Duncan and frigate HMS Montrose, will continue to accompany UK-flagged and international shipping and two American cruiser-destroyers, stationed at each end of the Strait\u0026nbspof Hormuz, will protect British ships when called upon.The two countries will, however, operate, for the time being, under different rules of engagement.Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, said: “The UK is determined to ensure her shipping is protected from unlawful threats and for that reason we have joined the new maritime security mission in the Gulf.“The deployment of the Royal Navy assets is a sign of our commitment to our UK-flagged vessels and we look forward to working alongside the US and others to find an international solution to the problems in the Strait of Hormuz.”Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, added : “It is vital to secure the freedom for all international shipping to navigate the Strait of Hormuz without delay, given the increased threat. This deployment will reinforce security and provide reassurance for shipping. Our aim is to build the broadest international support to uphold freedom of navigation in the region, as protected under international law.“Our approach to Iran hasn’t changed. We remain committed to working with Iran and our international partners to de-escalate the situation and maintain the nuclear deal.”Iran has, however, repeatedly complained about the British seizure of Grace 1 and demanded the release of its crew and cargo.Speaking at a news conference in Tehran on Monday, Mohammed Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, accused Britain of collaborating with the US in “economic terrorism”.Straits of Hormuz\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The names on a device\u0027s home screen will stay the same for now, but it\u0027s likely that the new name will appear when you open it.The battle over government access to people\u0027s private chatsThe company said it had made the decision to be clearer about the products and services that are part of Facebook.Facebook already follows the same pattern with its app made for communicating around offices, which is known as\u0026nbspWorkplace from Facebook, and its virtual reality platform Oculus has similar branding. Even Instagram has an app with a similar name: Boomerang from Instagram.The change of names comes as Facebook also looks to integrate the three services more closely together, leaving them as separate apps but powering them with the same underlying infrastructure.That will allow people to send messages from Instagram\u0027s DMs to WhatsApp chats, Mark Zuckerberg suggested when the overhaul was announced earlier this year.The Facebook boss said the decision had been made as part of a move towards making making Facebook a privacy-focused platform.“People want to be able to choose which service they use to communicate with people,” he wrote as part of a long blog post. ”However, today if you want to message people on Facebook you have to use Messenger, on Instagram you have to use Direct, and on WhatsApp you have to use WhatsApp.“We want to give people a choice so they can reach their friends across these networks from whichever app they prefer.The closer co-operation between the three services has also led to some problems. Facebook has been hit by a series of outages this year, including some of the biggest in its history – and those outages now regularly take down WhatsApp and Instagram, too.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

We must be better at what we do.“The Russians are benefiting from a huge increase in research and development spending  to  years ago which is now producing this new class of super-quiet Kilo Submarines.”Six of the advanced subs - known as Project . or Varshavyanka-class - have already been launched.Another batch of six boats will be ready by the end of the year, it has been reported.According to the report, the situation has been compared to the  blockbuster film The Hunt for Red October, adapted from a Tom Clancy book, in which a super-stealthy Russian sub goes rogue and heads across the Atlantic towards the east coast of the US. This comes after Admiral Radakin said he wants a “less stling process” to transform the Royal Navy’ fleet.Writing in Navy News, he said: “We’re going to invest even more in the North Atlantic to maintain the freedom of manoeuvre of the nuclear deterrent.“I also think we need to do more to respond to a changing world where there is more competition [and] greater risk of state-on-state conflict.”"},{"url":null,"title":"stressed dads to be are more likely to have naughty toddlers scientists find","story":"A series of follow-up questions recorded how likely their child was to misbehave.The results showed two-year-olds were more likely to have conduct and attention problemstheir fathers had been anxious while they were in the womb.Scientists think their stress is picked up by partners, affecting their hormones and behaviour.And they said the findings show that a father’s mental well-being during conception and pregnancy is as important as a mother’s.Lead researcher Prof Claire Hughes said: “For too long, the experiences of first-time dads has been side-lined or treated in isolation.“This needs to change.“Dficulties in children’s early relationships can have long-term effects.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Johnson has been so public and categorical in his statements that it is hard to see how his Government can go back on them.”Yesterday it emerged Germany doesn’t believe the PM will be able to make good on his threat to take the UK out without an agreement on October .Officials in Berlin reckon MPs will block No Deal and an ensuing election would result in a new pro-EU government committed to a second referendum.Sources said Mr Frost also conceded to Eurocrats that alternative arrangements to the Irish border may not be ready in time for Brexit day.Downing Street told them they could not pick and choose the votes they respected and Brexit would be on October .And in a U-turn, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Parliament could no longer block No Deal.He added: “The parliamentary arithmetic did not play out as I anticipated.”One diplomat suggested the admission would help bolster EU unity with Ireland, saying: “It was useful for us to hear that from the horse’s mouth.“The message is now being sent out from Brussels loud and clear to national capitals that eventhe EU gave up the backstop there is no alternative.”Brussels sources said Mr Frost also told the Commission the PM will seek a bare-bones trade deal after No Deal that totally frees Britain from EU rules.Mr Johnson’s top negotiator said the UK just wants a “conventional” FTA with no level playing field obligations.Such an agreement is seen by the EU as a downgrade on its offer to Britain of a pact that eliminates all tarfs and quotas infor alignment.It would mean Britain could erge from Brussels regulations, possibly gaining a competitive advantage for our businesses over European rivals.But the further away from EU rules the Government chose to go, the more barriers would be put up to trade between the UK and the Continent.A UK Government spokesman said there was “abundant scope to find the technological solutions necessary” to the Irish border in a future FTA.They said: “We are ready to negotiate in good faith an alternative to the anti-democratic backstop.“We want a friendly and constructive relationship as friends and partners in facing the challenges that lie ahead, based on a deep Free Trade Agreement.“We hope the EU will rethink its current refusal to make any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.“If the EU wants a deal it needs to change its stance.

The reality is that maybe she only has time for one more.But, whether it’s for the environment or not, I don’t blame him for not wanting more than two children.I have two and the very idea of having had a third makes me feel weary.

And I commend them for that.I also think Harry should be applauded for speaking up about climate change, especially as this week the Met Office confirmed that the hottest years on record have occurred in the past ten years.So why shouldn’t he use his very public  to talk about things that matter to him and to try to inspire others But, as is often the case, this royal couple seem to be damnedthey do and damnedthey don’t.They’ve already learned the hard way — with their wedding their handling of Archie’s birth and their choice of residence — that you can’t please all the people all of the time.And that, in a way, is a liberation. Because all that is left is to please yourselves.  By ignoring pressures about how many children they “should” have, they are going to have as many as they damn well please.Although why they have to announce it is another question.

Apart from anything , you don’t know what your kids will ­contribute to the world.WhatThomas Edison’s parents had given up after two  .

An inquiry to make sure all the co-ordination worked effectively and everything I have seen shows it did but there are always lessons to be learned. I have just spent some time at a residentsapos meeting and they had wholly legitimate questions about how to get to work, how to get home, family, pets, medical supplies and things. It comes as emergency work to prevent a damaged dam from bursting is continuing, as residents refusing to evacuate their homes were criticised for putting lives at risk. A senior police officer warned there could be catastrophic consequencesthe dam at Toddbrook Reservoir collapses while people remain within the evacuation zone in the Derbyshire town of Whaley Bridge. Thirty-one people, including a small number who were initially evacuated but have since ed to their homes, remained in  properties in the town on Sunday evening.    Deputy chief constable Rachel Swann told a residents meeting those who have defied orders to leave are not only putting their own lives at risk, but also those of emergency services staff who may have to look for themthe dam does break. She said: Weaposve not evacuated this for no reason. Weaposve evacuated this because there is real prospect the dam could fail andit fails it is catastrophic. People would dietheythey were in that evacuation zone. So those people who are remain in that zone at putting their lives at risk. They are also putting the lives of the responders, primarily the police, at risk because we have to keep going in and speaking to them and asking them to leave.  In response to a question from a resident who said he had been burgled, the officer said the force was using a drone to patrol the streets. Water levels at the reservoir have been reduced by more than . metres and, fortunately for workers at the site, Sundayaposs forecast of thunderstorms did not materialise.The Met Office said there was a risk of some showers overnight into Monday, but these would likely amount to just one or two millimetres of rainfall in the area.Derbyshire chief fire officer Terry McDermott said specialist engineers have monitored the dam wall  hours a day with lasers and are reassured by their assessment. He said: There has been no signicant deflection in the dam wall according to the feedback weaposve had so far, which gives us some reassurance. He added that a seven-day estimate for how long people would be out of their homes was a worst case scenario.    He explained that the sluice channel around the reservoir was coping well with both the water being pumped out by  pumps and the inflow to the lake which has been blocked off by RAF Chinook drops. Six rescue boats have been deployed in the region in case the dam bursts. Workers from construction firm Kier were praised for working through the night at the weekend to build a road around the reservoir so the massive pumps could be moved from one side to the other. Both Ms Swann and Mr McDermott praised the majority of residents in the area and the community spirit which the fire chief said was humbling.

Megan Tanneraposs son Kian became unwell in April  - going from a healthy and happy child to being rushed to hospital with suspected meningitis. When the terried mum, from Frome, Somerset, got to the hospital, Kian was leless and was instantly whisked away for emergency treatment. Kian was worked on by seven doctors before eventually being resuscitated and placed in intensive care. Describing the horror of watching her tiny son fall ill, Megan, , said: We were at home and he was just white and had no le to him and I thought something was seriously wrong. Then he started to go floppy and we called an ambulance straight away - there was just no le in him. Megan described how Kian was leless by the time they got to Royal United Hospital in Bath, where she was told to prepare for the worst.    The mum-of-three added: It was so traumatising. He was taken away and I just had to take myself to another room, I thought he was going to die. There were seven doctors working on him - it was like a wake-up call that something was really, really wrong. I just couldnapost believe how fast Kian went from being fine to nearly losing his le. I felt helpless. Kian was brought around, put on antibiotics and taken to intensive care for the first  hours - where Meghan was first told he had sepsis. She said: We were told he had sepsis during those two days in the neonatal intensive care unit. Even then I wasnapost truly aware how serious it could be. He was in a separate room all on his own with a member of staff  . ■ Sepsis affects , people in the UK and kills , per year. That’s more than bowel, breast and prostate cancer and road accidents combined. ■ Sepsis is the body’s often deadly response to an infection. ■ Initially, it can look like flu or a chest infection, but it can swtly get serious. ■ Seek medical help urgentlyyou develop any one of the following… – are lethargic or dficult to wake – feel abnormally cold to touch – the skin looks mottled, bluish or pale – are breathing very fast – have a rash that does not fade when you press it – have a fit or convulsion   It was so distressing and the whole family were beside themselves. We felt helpless and didnapost know what to do. After two days in intensive care, Kian remained critically ill, but was moved to the childrenaposs ward at the Bath hospital. Megan was told he would be on long-term antibiotics and would remain in hospital for a long time. The mum continued: While in hospital, Kian had to have his head shaved as the intravenous antibiotics had to go through a vein and because he was so little they could only find a vein in his head.  After a long eight weeks of Kian being on intravenous antibiotics, he was stable enough to come home.  Before we left the hospital we were given oral medication that had to be given twice a day for two weeks. After the two weeks of oral medication was complete, Kian had to be seen regularly over the next few months to make sure he was recovering and to make sure he had no lelong injuries from sepsis. For six months he wasnapost fully right and he struggled to find the energy to play and engage in things. Now heaposs really healthy and happy and we feel so lucky that he beat such a dangerous condition.

The confectionery giant is set to shrink some of its most famous treats as part of plans drawn up to tackle the childhood obesity crisis .This means family favourites such as the Curly Wurly will be reduced to  calories by the end of next year. It comes as Public Health England says firms must use less fattening ingredients or cut product sizes in order to help beat obesity.   Now Cadbury is set to cut the size of some inidual snacks but has admitted only some treats will see a reduction in price.A Curly Wurly is set to become slightly smaller in order to reduce its calories from  to , and the caloric content of a Cadbury Fudge is set to fall from .

Because the Antrim coast in Northern Ireland was the Holmes family stomping ground when I was growing up. The -mile drive out of Belfast along one of the world’s most scenic coast roads was always exciting. Our mode of transport was my father’s carpet van. No seatbelts – my elder brother Leonard, younger brother Brian and I were protected from being buffeted about by a roll of underfelt. Our destination: the beaches of Carnlough, Portstewart, Portrush, Waterfoot, Ballycastle, and our regular haunt Cushendall at the foot of the Glens of Antrim. Preparation for the seaside involved using pester power to persuade our mum and dad to take us to Woolworths for buckets, spades and fishing nets attached to bamboo sticks.  In my day we had metal buckets, which were useless because water always seeped out but we still loved playing with them. Our trunks were from Woolworths too – a brand called Ladybird. They were leopard print and we all pretended to be Tarzan because my dad told us they were made from cheetah skin. We used the nets in rock pools around Cushendall, and finding a starfish was a thrill. My dad would eat willicks – maybe they’re known as whelks in England. Seafood was a statement for us. We would be given dulse, or dried seaweed, as a treat rather than a bag of crisps. The pictures here are from  or , when I was six, Brian was five and Leonard was . In our day, the pictures were from a camera bought at the chemist’s with a  or -roll film.  We only used a camera for our summer holidays and maybe a birthday. People take  pictures a day now. But then, we took  or  a year.There were always photos of us at the beach because it felt like special times, eventhe weather was not so good – it’s funny, I don’t remember.We bought sun tan lotion from the chemist too. Ruth says there’s no such thing, only sun protection. But I’m telling you, we got sun tan lotion in those days – that’s what it was called. My father, Leonard, was a great man for spinning yarns. As we paddled in the sea he would be telling us to watch out for sharks. Of course there were no sharks, but we wouldn’t know that.   Then he would say: “Look – there’s a whale out there.” There was no whale, but we would feel sure we saw one. Then he would tell us to look out for pirates. A ball always played a great role in what would do – Dad always kicked a ball around with his three boys. Food is not made to be eaten on the beach. Often my mum Josie would make picnics but we soon realised it was not a great idea. To this day,I eat something with crunchy salt in, it reminds me of eating a sandy sandwich on the beach. We felt great freedom there. We wore hardly any clothes, saw no cars, were off school and had no times to be in for tea. We’d get to our holiday destination, usually a guest house in Cushendall, and couldn’t pick up any TV. The signal could not get over the mountains in the Glens of Belfast to the coast, so the picture would be very grainy and we couldn’t see our favourite programmes such as Top Cat, Blue Peter and Crackerjack. That made us do dferent things.  And I thank my father for this. We would watch films at the cinema in Cushendall with him, andwe had seen a war film then walked in a leafy lane, my father would say: “This is the jungle.” He would convince us we were in Burma. He was able to transport us anywhere in the world so we forgot about TV and instead we played and escaped to dferent scenarios. That’s the great thing about fresh air and reconnecting: you do things you wouldn’t normally do, and that’s what a holiday is all about. I recently filmed at Giant’s Causeway and was down at Ballycastle where we used to have a caravan. Being there was better than medicine – the smell and the mood people were in.

Kenny Kennard changed his surname by deed poll to aposFu-Kennardapos for a laugh a few years ago, but now the joke has backfired. Despite the -year-old former squaddie getting a driving license under his new moniker he has been told he cannot have it on a passport. When it expired earlier this year and he applied for a new one, his application was denied because his name may cause offence. The supermarket worker from Bude, Cornwall, has contested HM Passport Officeaposs verdict three times- but the Home Office has refused to budge.    Keen traveller Kenny said he doesnapost want to change his name again - so faces a le of UK holidays instead. He said: Iaposd decided to change my name to Fu-Kennard a few years back. When I had to apply for a driving licence, it was accepted fine, so I figured it wouldnapost make much dference in applying for a passport. How wrong I was. I got refused on grounds that my name could cause offence or was vulgar. So I complained, but they upheld their decision so I complained again. I was then told theyaposd keep the fee for administration costs. If I wanted to take the matter further, they said Iaposd need to contact my MP. So I wrote to MP Scott Mann, and he replied saying theyaposre within their remit to refuse.  Now Iaposm skint with no passport, like a prisoner in my own country. On the one hand, I find the whole thing funny - as do all of my friends. But Iaposm also finding it hard to believe the name could be construed as anything but funny and slightly ridiculous. Itaposs just a joke. I agree with Home Office policy that not all names are acceptable, such as racial hate words or anything that invokes hatred. aposFu-Kennardapos is not offensive, and I object to them denying my chosen name. Kenny first changed his name to aposCoco Kennyapos when he was , but after he joined the Army aged  he said he was told to change it back because it was immature. After eight years serving his country, Kenny decided to change it to something with a bit of aposfunapos about it. Knowing that heaposd be applying for aposnormalapos jobs, he knew to play it a bit safe - and settled for aposFu-Kennardapos because not everyone gets the joke.  Leaposs too short to be boring, he said. Kenny successfully applied for a driving licence in , so had no reason to suspect that it would be any dferent applying for a passport. But the Home Office dismissed his application on three occasions in May, June and July this year, citing Section  on its longstanding policy on changing names. The official guidelines list a series of names that may cause outrage or offence that could be classed as unacceptable and not fit for a passport. They include the use of swear words sexually explicit references inappropriate religious connotation is vulgar, offensive, or libellous to an inidual makes use of a name of a person living or dead which may cause public concern. The guidance also states: This applies to phonetic, as well as actual use of words comprising of part or the entire name. In a letter dated June , the office even advised that it would even retain Kennyaposs £. application fee to cover the costs of administration.  Bemused and bewildered, Kenny wrote to local Tory MP Scott Mann, whose office also supported HM Passport Officeaposs decision. The July  letter from Mr Mannaposs office stated - under Section  of Home Office policy, concerning aposunacceptable namesapos - HM Passport Office was within its remit to refuse your request for a passport under the name you have chosen. Kenny said the Home Office has told him it will only proceed with an application for a passporthe either changed his name to one that was acceptable - or uses his previous name. Their letter dated July  stated: Your application is deemed to contain a name, which may cause offence to iniduals and the wider public. The passport is not an appropriate vehicle to carry names which may be considered as distasteful or vulgar. The application will be failed and the fee retained, in line with HM Passport Office procedure, to cover the costs of administration.

Obama responded to the weekend shootings in Ohio and Texas on Monday with a plea to Americans to reject the language of hatred, fear and intolerance from any of their leaders. Without referring to Trump by name, he wrote: We should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments. The shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, killed  people. A -year-old white man has been charged with capital murder in Saturdayaposs shooting spree in Texas.    Police in El Paso cited a racist, anti-immigrant manesto posted online shortly before the shooting, which they attributed to the suspect. Democrats said Trump was indirectly to blame for the attack in Texas, with some drawing connections between his rhetoric to a resurgence in nationalism and xenophobic sentiment. In Dayton, Ohio, masked Connor Bettsapos rampage lasted less than a minute but he managed to fatally shoot nine people, including his younger sister Megan using a modied .-calibre automatic rle. He was shot dead by officers at the scene. Following the shootings, Trump proposed tighter monitoring of the internet, mental health reform and wider use of the death penalty in response to mass shootings. Trump did not address accusations that his own anti-immigrant and racially charged comments have contributed to a rise in race tensions, nor did he call for broad gun control measures.    In a bizarre series of tweets the US President also linked the atrocities to migration despite both gunman being white Americans. The President tweeted: We cannot let those killed in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, die in vain. Likewise for those so seriously wounded. We can never forget them, and those many who came before them. Republicans and Democrats must come together and get strong background checks, perhaps marrying.... ....this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform. We must have something good,not GREAT, come out of these two tragic events! Mr Trump, who called for strong background checks, has overseen a ban on so-called bump stocks, but has not pursued large-scale gun control. Barack Obama took executive actions on gun control, including on background checks and mental health.

In one horrying scene an unborn calf was cut from the womb of its dead mother, at the dockside in the Faroe Islands. Young children can be seen in the images looking at the bloodied animals and tourists watch on and take photos from just metres away from the dead whales. Residents on the Danish islands - just  miles off the coast of the UK -  carry out the centuries-old tradition to help feed the population of the remote Atlantic island over winter. The Faroese claim it is sustainable and regulated by law, but campaign groups say it is inhumane and want the hunts banned.    Charity Sea Shepherd UK documented the killing on Friday in the bay of Hvalvik. It claims this is the th whale hunt in the Faroe Islands this year, with  pilot whales slaughtered in total. The charity heard reports of a hunt - known locally as a grind - happening in Hvalvik. It watched on as fishermen in boats drove the defenceless whales towards the shore. A spokesman for the campaign group said: Over the course of the y drive more and more members of the public and tourists could be seen stopping along the coastline to watch the family of pilot whales struggle and resist. As is often the case, the grind was swtly becoming a social event with parents laughing and chatting as children played on the killing beach. The level of excitement was clearly growing as anticipation of the brutality came closer, epitomising the social aspect of the grind was the sight of a youth group - possibly a guides or scout group - sat eagerly watching and waiting. The Sea Shepherd UK crew filmed and photographed the hunt. The spokesman added: Grind participants ran cheering into the pod to start attaching ropes and pulling iniduals out to begin slaughtering.    Though, as usual, the aposhumaneapos process of killing the pilot whales was far from it, with multiple unsuccessful attempts to paralyse the with the lance were observed on a number of the pod. Having previously observed other pilot whale drives our crew noted that this pod had clearly been worn out or resigned to their fate as little to no cries were heard from the pod. As the family were laid out on the docks the all too familiar and disturbing images of children jumping on and playing with the dead could be seen. As the process continued crew witnessed one juvenile being laid out to be butchered and the harrowing sight of one unborn calf being cut from their motheraposs womb.    The calf appeared to be mere days or weeks from being born. In another case a small foetus was witnessed being removed. Our crew learnt from one participant that the unborn are not eaten and would later be aposed to the seaapos, an eloquent way of saying their bodies will be unceremoniously dumped. The Faroese often talk of the tradition behind the grindadrap and specically the respect shown to the pilot whales.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D.

We challenged the soccer centre to increase the number of children participating and ask how far and often they could let the young players experience events and festivals where and I am delighted they were able to match our ambitions. For that reason and for the second year running we are providing £, of funding. We know our funding last season allowed well over  young players to receive new strips in the Red Star design and attend events across the UK and we look forward to watching their developments over the next season.#Ben Tustin of the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre was equally delighted and said that the Ardrishaig Community Trust #is an excellent partner for us without which we would not have been able to deliver many of our strategic objectives. We are wholly dependent on external funding and volunteers and we do receive generous funding from other organisations as well as the Trust. Players subscriptions covers pitch hire, insurance and other bits and bobs but it is the support from other organisations that allows us to be ambitious and grow not only the number of children participating but also development opportunities including bringing in professional coaches for development weekends which are free to local children.#"},{"url":null,"title":"aliens invade lochgilphead library","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowChildren at Lochgilphead Library had a fun afternoon creating their own alien friends.As part of the LiveArgyll Space Chase to keep young people reading throughout summer, the theme of space travel was expanded upon at a merry little get together, with the children making their own little alien friends out of clay.While they worked, librarian Sylvia Bolwell read them a story of a distant planet where everyone fits in.The youngsters had a lot of fun chipping in with the story and they all had a fun new friend to take home."},{"url":null,"title":"northern jolly for loch fyne anglers","story":"Nikki ThompsonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club couldn’t have asked for better weather for its annual soirée to the fertile fishing grounds of Stornoway.The crossing from Ullapool was as smooth as you like and a sure sign we were in for a good couple of days. Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre.

wedding parties, but not guests, in their mansion.The owners, Michael and Stephanie Goddard bought the th century house in , before spending around pound.m renovating the property and grounds.The Goddards were granted permission to turn the house into a wedding venue with marquees in July , but Scottish Borders Council imposed strict conditions on the use after receiving strong objections from neighbours.One condition, that the planning permission was only valid for two years, was removed on appeal but the condition that only two rooms can be rented out in the mansion at a time has remained

opportunity for the current owners to accommodate visitors who have wished to re-establish their connection with Hartree House.ldquoThe opportunity to offer accommodation in Hartree House to guests will add signicantly to the attraction of Hartree as a venue and will assist towards the upkeep of the house and grounds.A castle, known as Hartree Tower, was present on the site by at least the th

The opening piece by Saint-Saëns was the perfect choice for the more intimate style of the smaller-scale orchestra. The central work was Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto in which the orchestra’s Director, Benjamin Marquise Gilmore, played the solo part and gave a stunning performance.At the end of the first movement, the audience were treated to an outstanding display of professionalism from the orchestra, when one of the strings on the soloist’s violin snapped, but then watched the smoothest of transitions as the player at the first desk immediately handed the soloist her own violin and the music continued uninterrupted while another player repaired the broken string.The concert finished with Beethoven’s nd Symphony and it was especially good to hear the use of natural trumpets and horns in this early but most attractive work. Also singled out for praise was the woodwind section and knitting all the performances together was the New Zealand conductor, Holly Mathieson.

I#ve been on many a demonstration in my time and this was one of the best.Rolling off the ferry on the Friday evening we were welcomed by a guard-of-honour standing along the pier waving saltires.The townsfolk turned out in droves to welcome us, waving saltires from windows and even stringing saltire bunting across the street at fourth-storey level. I had the romantic impression that the good folk of Campbeltown had been following the ious pro-independence rallies as they worked their way around the geography of Scotland and had just been waiting for their own town#s turn!The sun stayed out for us right until pm. Then the rain suddenly came down and we took down our Pensioners for Independence stall.  That evening Yes Kintyre put on a special party for us all with local musicians in the Argyll Arms Hotel.On Sunday some of us stayed on and explored your beautul peninsula. As the ferry pulled away that evening members of Yes Kintyre stood along the harbour wall holding up saltires to bid us farewell.Thank you all again for a memorable experience.Yours,Mary McCabe,Glasgow.Sir,It was my great privilege to attend yet another Open at Royal Portrush and to witness  year-old Oban golfer Robert MacIntyre finish tied sixth in his very first Major Championship.It was a wonderful performance, and confirmation, of the talent and the temperament we, the journalists, felt sure that he had.  He is now a Euro millionaire, but he remains an open, helpful and cheerful lad with both feet firmly planted on the ground, thanks to a great family and a strong desire to remain in his home town.I was at Glencruitten for the first time in June and soon discovered why Robert wants to go back there on a regular basis after weeks on tour.  It#s a terric club, no airs and graces.  They are very proud of Robert, and rightly so, but I very much doubtthey would allow him to lose his down-to-earth approach to international recognition.Yours,Jock MacVicar, Southend-born Scottishgolf correspondent and long-time Dunaverty member. Sir,Through the columns of your newspaper, may I express my grateful thanks to all the businesses, organisations, and iniduals, who donated to our fundraising, allowing the dancers to compete in the United States Highland Dancing Championships held recently in Las Vegas.We had a very successful trip, placing in both the Highland and choreography events. It’s installed in the dancers they are there to represent Campbeltown and the Dance School rather than any inidual, and hearing the town name announced at the presentation of trophies to our four trophy winners was a very proud moment indeed.

Some sort of gathering must have taken place over the weekend. You cannot run a countryyou can#t distinguish between a glass bottle and a tin can.At least something sensible is going to be done about the Rest and Be Thankful road. It was acceptable to try to prevent the hillside from being washed onto the roadway.

There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation. However, the march went off without any incident and there were no arrests, with only one warning which was drug related.A spit of rain earlier in the day failed to develop into poor weather as the marchers would round the town to hear speakers and listen to musicians at the rally at Kinloch Green.Mr Wilson said he was particuarly pleased at the turnout as there had been some confusion over whether the march would go ahead due to internal sions within the hierachcy of All Under One Banner, which has organised independence marches across the country.Following Mr Singh#s sacking, founder Neil Mackay resigned from his position on its national executive pending an internal investigation.Pro-UK Unionist group A Force For Good met the march on the shore front and say they filmed and counted the marchers, as they have at previous events, and afterwards claimed the turnout was just .Director, Alistair McConnachie, said: #All Under One Banner is basically the marching wing of the SNP. AUOB, and SNP MPs and MSPs, lie about the numbers which attend their marches, sometimes up to  or  times.#Unfortunately, they are not challenged by the Scottish media. The good news is that A Force For Good has a presence at every AUOB march.

An eye mask normally helped and after running over  kilometres the body is ready to sleep.ldquoOn the plus side, I didnrsquot need a torch!Jamie slept on a blow-up mattress in a summer sleeping bag and bivi bag, under a tarpaulin.The former Belhaven Hill School, Stenton Primary School and Loretto School pupil caught the publicrsquos attention four years ago.He left his job at an international communications agency in London to run from Canadarsquos third largest city, Vancouver, to the capital of Argentina, Buenos Aires.The -month adventure raised more than pound, for CALM , Macmillan Cancer Support and WaterAid.Jamie iss busy putting pen to paper about the adventure, with more than , words already written.He told the Courier that writing the book was ldquoharder and more time consuming than the adventure itself.Since then, he has also scaled the highest mountain in the southern and western hemisphere ndash Aconcagua, in Argentina ndash and cycled from Sao Paulo, in Brazil, to Bolviarsquos La Paz. He has completed over , kilometres of adventuring over the last five years and visited  dferent countries.ldquoEven though my current adventures are as toughnot tougher than those in the past, people just assume I will successfully complete them, he said.ldquoI think I need to get better at making people realise what I am doing.

Are the faces staring out from the pages of glossy magazines shining with wellbeing  They might be tanned, toned, and expensively exfoliated, butany of these iniduals has a heart full of joy, it is unlikely to be as a result of their lestyle.In a recent talk, Nicola Sturgeon made an appeal to commonsense, stating what, deep down, most of us already know. She claims that when calibrating a countryrsquos standing and success, gross domestic product is not the most accurate measure. Not least among the misleading factors when using GDP as a guide is that its figures ignore unpaid carersrsquo work, yet put a value on illegal drug consumption. Just as worryingly, says Ms Sturgeon, ldquoIt values activity in the short term that boosts the economy eventhat activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.The First Ministerrsquos laudable aspiration is that ldquothe objective of economic policy should be collective wellbeing ndash how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is. Hoping to establish a fairer and truer scale of assessment, she is collaborating with the prime ministers of New Zealand and Iceland ndash women all, in charge of countries geographically on the fringes, who are prepared to challenge convention.Cynics might, of course, say that Ms Sturgeon is simply laying the groundwork for another independence bid, in which those predicting dire financial consequences will be brushed off as old-fashioned and out of touch by placing too much emphasis on our economic prowess. Yet with Brexit, not just economists but rabid Leavers acknowledge that orce from the EU will cause financial shockwaves. Clearly, this is a risk they think worth running. By the same token, idealists north of the Border, who want us to exit from the UK, often say that the possibility of diminished economic performance after independence would not in itself be a deal breaker. There are bigger issues at stake.That argument is for another day. At this point, were Scotland to become a pioneer in putting a fairer society ahead of a more affluent one, this would represent nothing less than a second enlightenment. The inequalities in health and housing, education and attainment that are nakedly apparent all around us, are shaming for one of the wealthiest countries in the world. No matter how much those at the top make, or how vibrant our financial markets, poverty and desperate hardship for too many people persists. Itrsquos tempting to think that those who see GDP and similar indices as telling the whole story have also embraced the biblical creed that the poor will always be with us ndash in other words, there is nothing we can do about their plight.While the SNP has not been far-sighted or proactive enough to combat the recent shocking rise in drug-related deaths, many of them linked to deprivation and hopelessness, nevertheless Ms Sturgeon and the like-minded leaders with whom she is allied, have a strong social conscience. If the message that money is only part of the equation takes hold, it could potentially prove a turning point for the way all rich societies see, and regulate, themselves.Naturally therersquos a danger when writing disparagingly about high-income earners of appearing either green-eyed or preachy. Despite spending a childhood in the pews, hearing how the widowrsquos mite was as valuable as the millionairersquos cheque, and that those who are hard up today will be blessed with eternal treasures in the hereafter, I nevertheless know that no pair of rose-tinted spectacles can make a terrying bill, an unattainable holiday or too-expensive winter coat, one bit easier to bear. As Mae West put it bluntly: ldquoIrsquove been rich and Irsquove been poor, and rich is better.When it comes to wellbeing, you donrsquot need a carbon monoxide monitor to recognise that the air in Stornoway or St Abbs is far better for us than that in the throbbing financial hearts of Edinburgh or Glasgow, or for that matter Tokyo and New York. Wellbeing consists of something way beyond liquidity, location, or assets. Those in their gated communities, who store their Cartier watches in a vault, have cut themselves off from the rest of society. Is that really enviable  This is not to say they might not be really decent, kind-hearted people who give generously to good causes. Perhaps some of them are. But no matter how open-handed they appear to be, money creates a spiralling gulf between the haves and the have-nots, and sometimes cause rts much closer to home, as family lawyers will attest.Far from solving the problem by capitalistsrsquo pet theory of ldquotrickle-down, too much capital at the top of society actually entrenches inequality. Thus, the endless pursuit of higher incomes, pricier properties, competitive conspicuous consumption, whether at a personal or national level, is intrinsically unhealthy. Once you believe that the GDP graph should show an inexorable year-on-year increase, you become blinkered. This is as true, I suspect, for those running the country as for the inidual.Hunger for amassing hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the power that comes with it, is a recipe for potential disaster. It is psychologically and spiritually corrosive.

But donrsquot think any of this means wersquore about to see an openly gay star in the menrsquos game, or that football is on the verge of a breakthrough. Wersquore not and it isnrsquot. Menrsquos football still has a serious problem with sex and sexuality.I know this because Irsquove dealt with some of the people involved. A while ago, I spent several months, through a friend, trying to convince a player with a Scottish premiership side to speak to me publicly about his sexuality. He appeared to be open to persuasion, but in the end he decided it just wasnrsquot worth the heartache.What was particularly interesting is that the playerrsquos team-mates and other players, the managers, and other staff, including my friend, all knew about his sexuality and were fine with it. Which leaves only one reason not to go public: the fans.:What its like to be a gay football fan in Scotland in Donrsquot misunderstand what Irsquom saying here: Irsquom not suggesting everyone in football management is cool with being gay ndash even now, most managers are older, working-class men who are often the last to adapt to changing social attitudes. Irsquove also spoken to a former youth coach who said he was told by a premiership side he couldnrsquot be employed with them because of his sexuality.However, itrsquos obvious that, on the whole, attitudes to sexuality within football have been changing and players and staff are generally much more open on the subject .The reaction of players has also possibly always been exaggerated. Karren Brady, the former boss of Birmingham City, said the other day that her husband, Paul Peschisolido, had played with Justin Fashanu in the s and no one in the dressing room had a problem with him being gay.The point is that, whether Karren Brady is right or not about the s, attitudes in the game have been improving, just as they have in society generally. There are several clubs in the UK now that have gay players who are honest about their sexuality within the team and even take their partners to club events ndash they are just not open about it in public.The Celtic captain Scott Brown was also clearly being honest when he said he would be supportive to a team-mate who was gay. And even players at Millwallhave said it doesnrsquot mattera team-mate is gay. As one football commentator put it to me: other players wouldnrsquot give a ****.:English menrsquos game could soon have its first openly gay professional playerThe problem is that some fans are unlikely to feel the same way. Recently, my colleague Neil Cameron spoke to one of the players with the LGBT team HotScots FC, Craig Anderson, who said there have been times when the homophobic abuse hersquos heard at games has made him wonder whether football is the game for him. Irsquove also spoken to some of the HotScots players myself and they pretty much all say the same thing: in the changing room, sexuality is not a problem out in the stadium among some of the fans, it still is.Itrsquos interesting to speculate on what the reasons for this might be. One theory that amuses me is that the fans who are most vocal with homophobic abuse are trying to come to terms with the fact they love a game that idolises physically fit young men. A game like football in which the players are so uninhibited about kissing and touching each other should be the least homophobic of all, but some male fans may struggle with that, so they shout about poofs and queers to try to prove to the rest of us that theyrsquore not interested in the sight of players kissing and hugging other men. But wersquore on to them. We know they secretly love it.The idea that homophobia in football might be a problem with specic types of men rather than fans more generally is also borne out by the recent womenrsquos world cup. Menrsquos professional football has virtually no openly gay players, but the womenrsquos game is the opposite ndash it is full of out gay women at the highest level.And even the homophobia the female players experience confirms this is really a male problem wersquore talking about: some fans like to assume all female players are lesbians because they think football is essentially a manrsquos sport and any woman who wants to play it must ldquowant to be a man.Unfortunately, there is only one way to tackle this. Players can, and should, do positive interviews like the one Scott Brown did at the weekend. Football clubs can also prove how open they are, as Partick Thistle did recently with their kit inspired by the LGBT rainbow flag. But sadly, none of it will be enough to change the attitude of fans ndash that will only happen when the first British professional player in the premier league goes public about his sexuality.Are we getting closer to that point  You might think the tweets from ldquothe gay footballer prove we are. The tweeter said he was a professional player and would go public at the end of July. However, he then deleted the account which must obviously raise doubts about its authenticity. It also disappointed a lot of football fans because they know the game needs its first openly gay player.Whoever that player ends up being, he will definitely get abuse and there will be a backlash from some fans, and possibly players on other teams. But until someone openly challenges the homophobia in football by being openly gay, the homophobia will not go away.I realise thatrsquos a lot for one person to take on and he will have to be a pretty extraordinary person. But after it has happened, others will follow. Gay players will then become more visible. They will then be just part of the team. And finally homophobia in football will become socially unacceptable.It will also become a little ridiculous.

As of yesterday however that fuse appears to have been lit and the resultant explosion could well prove catastrophic.The decision by Indiarsquos Hindu nationalist-led government to revoke the special constitutional status of Jammu and Kashmiris easily the most far-reaching move on the disputed Himalayan area in nearly seventy years.To say that citizens and watchers of the region are worried, would be a considerable understatement. Already India has flooded Kashmir with thousands of extra troops in anticipation of unrest and rioting.:Last man standing: President Putin and the worlds leaders-for-leKashmiri leaders meanwhile have been placed under house arrest, while Internet service and nearly all telephone communication have been cut off, schools closed and measures readied to evacuate foreign tourists from this stunningly beautul mountainous area.So just what exactly has happened, why now and what might the implications be for the already strained relations between arch-rivals India and neighbouring Pakistan For years the entire Jammu and Kashmir region has beendisputed between these two giant nations. Each claims it in full, but control only parts of it.But it wasamid an angry session in Indiarsquos parliament yesterday that the countryrsquosinterior minister, Amit Shah, proposed the abolition of article , which grants Kashmirits own constitution and autonomy over all matters except for areas such as foreign affairs and defence.Allied to this is articleA that also gave the Kashmir government the right to decide who qualies as a lsquopermanent resident.rsquoMr Shah claims the move was made in view of constant threats of cross border terrorism from an insurgency underway inMuslim-majority Kashmir.Critics of Indiarsquos efforts to revoke such status however say that in doing away with Article , the government hopes to changeKashmirs Muslim-majority demographics by allowing in a flood of new Hindu residents.The enormous sensitivity surrounding this issue and such moves is obvious. This was summed up yesterday byMs Mehbooba Mufti, formerChief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir who insisted therevocation of Article  would have serious implications not just for the state, but also for India as a country and the whole subcontinent.ldquoThey just want to occupy our land and want to make this Muslim-majority state like any other state and reduce us to a minority and disempower us totally, Ms Mufti warned.Worrying as the moves are, many say the timing should come as no surprise.Indiarsquos governing Bharatiya Janata Party,has deep roots in a Hindu nationalist ideology and one of its campaign promises during the election earlier this year had been removing the special status of Kashmir.Indeed the far-right BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi who won re-election stand accused of campaigning on a secular agenda that strives to make India a Hindu state.Over the past five years, Mr Modirsquos BJP bloc has been spreading an us-versus-them philosophy in a country already riven by dangerous isions. As a result, the Hindu right has perhaps never been more enfranchised at every level of government.:The suffering of Syrias childrenWhile many of Mr Modirsquos more moderate supporters hoped he might set the sectarianism aside in the wake of his landslide election victory this year, the latest moves over Kashmir now suggest otherwise.To date, Mr Modirsquos tough-guy approach has largely been a disaster in the disputed region. His heavy-handedness there appears only to have inflamed rather than quell the separatist insurgency in Kashmir. The latest moves too will only further alienate even moderate Kashmiris who already live under a heavy Indian military presence.This very muscular approach has been typical of Modirsquos approach to Indiarsquos foreign policy as a whole, especially in relation to Pakistan, which lies on the other side of the rivalry over Kashmir.Both nuclear-armedcountries have already fought three wars over the region, which both claimed as their own.The Pakistani-backed separatist insurgency in Kashmir meanwhile has claimed the lives of at least , security forces, insurgents and civilians.The capacity for tensions to boil over quickly was again exposed in Februarywhen a Kashmiri militant rammed a vehicle filled with explosives into a convoy of Indian paramilitary forces travelling on a highway, killing at least  soldiers.A banned terrorist group, Jaish-e-Muhammad, which is based in Pakistan, claimed responsibility.In the tense military standoff between India and Pakistan that ensued, warplanes from both countries engaged in aerial dogfights.:David Pratt: On the streets of Kabul, fear and optimism grip the cityAgainst this backdrop, Indiarsquos proposal yesterdayis the most radical change any government has suggested for Kashmirrsquos status since the region was granted autonomy in exchange for joining the Indian union after independence in .By any standards, itrsquos a highly contentious and potentially dangerous move, leading onesenior leader of the opposition party the Indian National Congress, yesterday to say ldquotoday the BJP has murdered the Constitution of India.For the moment though all eyes will be focused on what happens on the ground in Kashmir. Back in  the then US president Bill Clinton described it as arguably ldquothe most dangerous place in the world today.As of yesterday, Kashmir could once again be heading for that ominous distinction."},{"url":null,"title":"miles-briggs-sick-kids-buck-must-stop-government","story":"Itrsquos hard to imagine how this botched project could have gone any worse.

How do you sum up ldquoI worked my backside off to get one B and two Cs and now Irsquom going to college because university isnrsquot for me, it isnrsquot for lots of young people, and we shouldnrsquot be made to feel like second-class citizens because of it in one image Not so easy, not even with giant cardboard letters.Maybe triplets would help, on account of being able to hold up the most expansive flash cards.Remembering exam hell should be a universal leveller, but of course it isnrsquot because our education system is far from being a universal leveller.Some people will remember being well prepped by private tutors and surrounded by hard working peers in an environment where results matter because results paid wages.Others will remember a teacher from another class sneaking in to write Ode to Autumn on the blackboard and having you memorise it ahead of the Higher English exam because she knew your actual class teacher just wasnrsquot that into the whole teaching thing and you were all likely going to fail without a dramatic intervention.Seasons of mists and mellow fruitfulness came in very handy for passing the exam, indeed, but then what While I cannot envy young people having to sit exams ndash never, never again, thank you ndash what I do envy them is the push to lay out all options before them.More and more young people from Glasgow now are going to Oxbridge ndash still in tiny numbers, but tiny increasing numbers.Not because pupils from days before were not achieving the necessary marks, but because now young people are being encouraged to see all options as open to them, no matter their class or background.Last year I interviewed a young woman from a Glasgow comprehensive who was going to study in America.I would never in a million years have thought that Oxbridge might have been possible for me, that New York or Calornia might have been possible for me.Irsquom so glad that we are telling our working class, state educated young people that the world is really their oyster and that nothing is off limits.University, though, is not for everyone, not even those who are high academic achievers. It would be wonderful, on results day,this was more widely recognised. That going to college or into the workplace with fewer Highers and National s had just as much value.There are pupils now getting six or seven Highers in the one year. This is a stellar achievement and, of course, down to hard work. But a degree of luck is involved that yoursquove happened to have been born with an academic brain.Some of us might work our very socks off and never be able to achieve six A grades. And what of those who feel six A s are a certainty but who come away with less than they were expecting This is where not listening to advice comes in. Everyone will be ready to step in with a story about how disappointment makes a person stronger. Or how an unexpected result pushed them on a path better than the route they planned to take. They will say that it is not the end of the world.Rot. It is the end of the world as you know it, whether the results are what you planned or not.It is the end of the time when exam results matter and when the next stage of le is yet to begin.After an intense and stressful time, studying, sitting exams, it very rapidly becomes apparent how the meaning of these results depreciates.People will tell you that, ultimately, school exam results cease to matter. Itrsquos a complicated argument because yes, practically, there will come a point when your Higher results simply do not matter any more, yet they will always matter as a step to what you do next.You have to decide for yourself how seminal these results are, how make or break, and whether they mould you stronger or alter your plans for the better.I imagine it would help the decision-making processuniversity wasnrsquot perpetually touted as the highest marker of success.Exam results are only one marker of success.

Now, the environmental body hopes that this will be reduced by Scotland’s forthcoming depositscheme.Under the scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic or glass bottles and aluminium or steel cans. People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher. Steel and aluminium cans, glass bottles will also be part of the scheme. The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.

Orkney’s MSP highlighted the government’s continued failure to find a solution to the islands’ internal ferry services, including replacement vessels, and the lack of progress on implementing RET on external services, a year on from the promised start date. Mr McArthur said: “The National Islands Plan will be important in mapping out the areas where improvements are needed to secure a vibrant future for our island communities.“During the passage of the legislation, I moved amendments making clear that one of the most urgent priorities would be delivering changes and improvements to leline ferry services to meet the needs of people and businesses in Orkney.“This seems to be the message that is coming through loud and clear in the consultation, as demonstrated by the recent response from the NFUS.  It will come as a surprise to no one but should act as a clear signal to ministers that the continued failure to act is unacceptable.“We need a sustainable and long term solution to the funding and operation of our internal ferry services, on which some of our most fragile communities rely. This includes replacement vessels for a fleet that is ageing and no longer fit for purpose.“In addition, more than a year on from the date on which RET was supposed to be introduced, we seem no nearer seeing the reduction in fares. Those using these services are therefore continuing to pay over the odds. That is not good enough.“Having initiated the consultation, the government now have an obligation to act.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions.

The goodwill for such agreements was there, she added.It is easy to see the appeal of such agreements for those voters who believe that Brexit – especially the no-deal iety now envisaged by the Prime Minister – represents a catastrophic act of self-harm. If Swinson and the leaders of other avowedly anti-Brexit parties could reach agreements in key constituencies across the UK to stand only the candidate with the greatest chance of winning then, surely, the chances of the Johnson project being stopped in its tracks would be greatly enhanced.There are just one or two small hurdles in the way…The first of these is the fact that, although speculation runs feverishly, Johnson has not yet called a general election.It’s certainly true that many Conservative Party MPs would like the new PM to capitalise on a boost in the polls to try to increase their numbers at Westminster, but others believe this might be a risky strategy. If Nigel Farage’s Brexit Partysplits the right-wing Eurosceptic vote, then a snap election could bring the Johnson premiership to a sudden end.But let us imagine that Johnson goes down the general election route before the current Brexit deadline of  October and that Swinson sets about trying to build an anti-Brexit coalition. She might have been able to persuade Plaid and the Greens to step aside in a single by-election, but would these parties really be so keen to lay down their electoral chances across the country  Would they risk, by seeing their overall votes in a general election diminish severely, becoming less politically relevant And what about the SNP, every bit as opposed to Brexit as the Lib Dems  There are fewer seats in Scotland where anti-Brexit parties risk splitting the vote than there are in England, but one of them – East Dunbartonshire – is Swinson’s own.Swinson served as MP for that constituency between - and was then defeated by the SNP’s John Nicolson. She took the seat back in , largely, I suspect because of Nicolson’s unpopularity. But with a more impressive candidate, the SNP would surely have a fighting chance of snatching it back. The removal of the leader of the Liberal Democrats from the House of Commons would represent quite a scalp for the nationalists. Can you imagine Nicola Sturgeon passing up the opportunity to see off Swinson  I can’t. And nor would I blame the SNP leader for committing signicant resources to bringing down Swinson. Politics is a contact sport and Swinson is a major target. The suggestion from her that the SNP should give her a clear run at the seat would, rightly, be met with derision.Jo Swinson is not the only party leader now talking about pacts. Brexit Party leader Farage has raised the prospect of deals with the Conservatives, particularly in the north of England, to ensure the election of Eurosceptic MPs.Given the result of the  referendum, any such agreements would surely guarantee the evisceration of any anti-Brexit candidates in those areas.Yes, electoral pacts might be made to work for pro-EU parties but they could just as easily be the secret of Brexiteer success.Those now clamouring for agreements to be struck between the Lib Dems and other parties which take the same position on EU membership should, I think, be careful that they are not wishing for the creation of two-horse races in key constituencies across the country. That scenario would risk strengthening rather than weakening the Brexiteers’ squad at Westminster.Johnson is supported by a team in government that is fully committed to Brexit by  October at any cost. The PM will gladly sacrice the best interests of the UK economy to protect himself.This being so, and with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour still embarrassingly weak on the matter of Brexit, the idea that the Johnson project might be stopped is an appealing one to those of us who would dearly like to see Brexit cancelled at this late stage.But I fear that any plan to run a single anti-Brexit candidate in a constituency would be met with a plan to run a single pro-Brexit candidate. Jiggery-pokery would be fought with jiggery-pokery.It is abundantly clear that Brexiteers won the  referendum with a campaign strewn with lies. Their promises of an effortless, painless departure from the EU have long since been exposed.But rather than turning against campaign leaders, pro-Brexit voters appear to be hardening their positions and cheering on a damaging no-deal departure.It may now be obvious that Brexit is going to be dficult to deliver. But stopping it will be harder still.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll majority of scots now in favour of independence","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon hailed as phenomenal a survey showing that  per cent of voters would back independence, compared to  per cent who would vote to stay in the UK.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

Written by playwright Laurence McKeown and centred on events surrounding the pogroms, which led to the outbreak of the Troubles  years ago this August, the play details how sectarian violence erupted across the city, how families were forced to flee their homes and ended up taking refuge across the border. Brassneck Artistic Director Tony Devlin told the Andersonstown News how the play will coincide with the th anniversary of the events, which were the catalyst for the Troubles. “This play is a daring piece of writing that will force audiences to not only reflect on the  years since the Troubles began but through it we want to create a conversation for debate and discussion about how we collectively move forward for the benefit of future generations.“The play explores one woman’s journey from Bombay Street after that night when her family were forced from their home and forced to go to a place called Gormanston down south where these families stayed for a few months while Bombay Street was rebuilt or they were rehoused,” he said. “ years later, this woman, who was  at the time, is expecting a researcher from Dublin to come and talk to her about the events of that night. This character Rosie Murray is played by acclaimed actor Roma Tomelty who I have known for years and am delighted to be working with in this project.”Tony spoke of how the play was to be first performed at The MAC theatre back in May but had to be halted due to the tragic death of fellow lead actress Mary Jordan’s mother in a car accident in Dublin. “We cancelled the show and now are in a position to bring it back. Working on this, directing this has been an education for me having been born in the late ’s, I had never heard of Gormanston. I didn’t know we had refugees in our own country during this time in our history. “Myself and Laurence also wanted to focus on the North South ide which is an underlying theme in this play. We wanted to address how the North and South has been pulled apart since partition.”Roma Tomelty who portrays the character of Rosie Murray said she knew “exactly who she, Rosie, was” from the first few lines of the script. “I have known Tony a long time, he asked me to play the part and we have a long history. When I got the script, the first line is that ‘I went to St Vincent’s School’ – which I did so from then on in I thought I know exactly who you are. The play is marking this event. “I was on the road the night the burning of Bombay Street happened. We were trying to get home to Andersonstown, my aunt was burnt out of Dover Street. “There is a line in the play about ‘ordinary people living in extraordinary times’. I remember driving through the chaos that night, you just got on with it,” she said. Actor Mary Jordan’s character is now a researcher after “turning her back” on her former banking career during the Celtic Tiger. “My character becomes very interested in Rosie’s story and to learn that there were refugees from Belfast. She comes to visit Rosie to hear more and I can’t say anymore than that,” she added cryptically. “Audiences will find out more as the play progresses.”Something in the Air will run at the Roddy McCorley Social Club from Wednesday August  until Sunday August .Tickets are priced at £ and are available from the bar."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"family of joe burns raise over 3000 in","story":"THE family of a popular barman at The Chester have surpassed the £, mark in their fundraising efforts to keep his memory alive.Joe Burns died suddenly five years ago in July , aged just  after collapsing at his parent’s home.Joe was a fit and healthy boxer who trained regularly at the gym.Tragically, the day after his death, his girlfriend Sinead discovered she was pregnant with their daughter Bella who is now four-years-old.Soon after Joe’s death, his family learned Joe’s mum Una and sister Jeanette both carry the faulty gene for Long QT, an inherited condition that can cause heart rhythm disturbances. Left undiagnosed, it can cause sudden death where someone has an unexpected cardiac arrest.Every year since, Joe’s family and friends take part in the annual Belfast Marathon, with all proceeds going towards the British Heart Foundation who use the money to fund research into silent heart conditions.This year,  members of Joe’s family and friends raised £, from their Marathon efforts. Their recent fundraising efforts have brought their overall total since Joe’s death to an amazing £, for the charity.Joe’s sister Jeanette O’Neill said: “This is the third year we have taken part in the Belfast Marathon for the BHF in Joe’s memory. Each year we just keep getting bigger and better with more people from our community getting involved through the full marathon, fun run and relay.“When Joe died our family was absolutely devastated. He was a real character and everyone knew him. He made such a big impact on so many people and it’s amazing that so many of his friends are still so supportive and want to help our fundraising efforts.“We don’t want what happened to our family to happen to any other family so that’s why we fundraise for the BHF because their research into conditions like Long QT are making such a big dference.”Jeanette said they have been overwhelmed by the support from their local community since Joe’s death.“Friends and family have just been fantastic. We are also hugely grateful to the Thunderdome in Glengormley for hosting a buffet for Joe’s runners after the marathon. It gave us a chance to get together after the event and share stories about Joe. It was so lovely.”"},{"url":null,"title":"car strikes lamppost after driving erratically in belfast","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is perched above the Co Donegal village of Burt and attracts thousands of visitors every year.The fort is a powerful manestation of what remains of ancient Ireland and on a clear day, from its pinnacle, it is possible to get a glimpse of three counties-Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The commanding and spectacular waterways of Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle lie to its west and east respectively.But, in the th Century the fort, once home to kings of old Gaelic order, was rapidly disintegrating towards extinction. It was however saved by the vision of one man who spearheaded its restoration just over  years ago.Dr Walter Bernard was born on May ,  at Newmarket, Co Cork. His father was a captain in the th Rles, a regiment of the British Army and was amongst the reinforcements that arrived in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo in June of  but was apparently too late to take part in the famed history changing conflict.Walter became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in , a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in  and Fellow of that college in .Between - Dr Bernard served as a surgeon throughout the Crimean War attending the wounded British soldiers at Inkerman and witnessed the ravages caused by small pox and cholera. He later recalled that for every man that was shot, fty more were killed by those diseases, particularly in the notoriously harsh winters of  and .On the journey home from the Ukranian battlefields, he saved a man from drowning and was awarded with a certicate from the Royal Humane Society. Then, with his experiences of military conflict at an end, Dr Bernard landed back in Ireland and settled in Buncrana before building up a very large medical practice in Derry. He ran this surgery for over sixty years and was a prominent member of the city’s branch of the British Medical Association as well as holding many public offices throughout his career.One such appointment was to examine the quality of water in the city for Londonderry Corporation at public facilities such as the Creggan reservoirs built in stages between -, and which supplied much of the city’s domestic and industrial water needs.His experience of the waterborne disease cholera in the Crimea made him an ideal candidate for this job.Dr Bernard also addressed the Medical Society of King and Queens College of Physicians on the issuer of diphtheria in April . He cautioned the assembled medics that there was a reason why the disease was largely absent from statistics sheets.He said: “There are few diseases about which so many mistakes in diagnosis are made.”He feared the misdiagnosis rate was so high that it was almost impossible to ensure that ‘true diphtheria’ was as common in a town as reported.Dr Bernard added: “Diphtheria occurs in Londonderry, I have no doubt whatever…in my practice it has been my lot to treat many cases of this disease.”At some point in , Dr Bernard paid a visit to Grianan of Aileach and many years later in , he said of the experience: “Seventeen years ago, when this traditional and historical place was first visited by me, I found it in a very ruinous condition, and from that time I commenced to take an interest in its associations.“Year after year I witnessed further advance of its ruin, and I clearly saw thatsomething were not soon done to arrest the progress of its destruction, it would be in a few years a thing of the past.”Grianan of Aileach is a hilltop fort that sits on top of Greenan Mountain in Inishowen just over  feet above ground level.The ringfort was thought to have been built in the sixth or seventh century, although there is some evidence to suggest that the site had been in use before that.Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy penned a remarkably accurate map of Ireland in  A.D. from which maps were later created in the th and th centuries. He called the land ‘Iouernia’, thought to mean ‘abundant land’ from which the Irish names Eriu and Eire are derived. Amongst two sites identied as ‘regia’ or royal places in Ireland by the Greek map maker, one of them is believed by some historians to be the Grianan of Aileach.Whether Ptolemy pinpointed it or not, the Kingdom of Aileach was indeed one of Ireland’s royal sites of the Gaelic order. The fort was thought to have been constructed originally by the northern section of the Ui Neill clan, but between  A.D. and the thirteen centuries, over  kings from ious clans, some also High Kings of Ireland, held the throne of Aileach. The last man to be known as the King of Aileach was Aed Buide Ua Neill who died in .Despite ious interpretations, it is generally agreed that Aileach means ‘stony place’ and the word Grianan means ‘sunny place’ so that Grianan of Aileach broadly translates as ‘The Stone Palace of the Sunny View’.Whatever the actual meaning of its name, it is evident that it was an extremely important place. Aileach’s political and strategic importance was such that the annals of Irish history record that it was attacked at least three times. In , Finsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort.Again, in , when Muirchertach MacNeill was king, Viking raiders sacked the site when they settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. It’s also thought that King Brian Boru came to Aileach in , but it was destroyed once more in , when another King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briaincame to Inishowen and plundered the region and razed the fort. The fort was laid to waste by O’Brien in revenge for O’Neill’s destruction of his royal seat at Kincora and he reportedly told his soldiers to each take a stone from the Donegal hillside so the place would be reduced to rubble.The fort itself could have served two main s both as a defensive and a ceremonial one and moreover as a settlement that was surrounded by ringforts of lesser importance. Whatever its actual , it is known that buildings of this nature were very rare in North West Ulster and its presence signies that its inhabitants were regarded as being very important.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe linking of St Patrick to the site is seen as attempt by Christian converts to place it firmly in that tradition whilst acknowledging its pagan history and the naming of a holy well right outside the ringfort in honour of Ireland’s patron saint seems to confirm that.There is also a mythological and folklore version of the founding of Grianan of Aileach which says the ringfort was built by Dagda , a god and the king of the Tuatha De Danann-the supposed ‘Tribe of the Gods’-a supernatural race in Irish mythology. The Tuatha De Danann are said to have invaded Ireland before the Celts and built strategic stone forts on the tops of hills.Dagda was said to have fought the Second Battle of Moytirra against the Fomorians and the fort at Aileach was built over the grave of his son Aedh who had been murdered.In , a Derry based group called the Irish Irelanders, enthusiastic Gaelic revivalists travelled to the site on Sunday afternoons and carried out some repairs. But, the splendour and historical intrigue of Grianan of Aileach had largely been ignored for many years until in , Dr Walter Bernard decided to begin its restoration in earnest.In the s, painter, musician, antiquarian and archaeologist George Petrie examined Grianan of Aileach when he was head of the Royal Irish Academy’s antiquities committee which was linked to the Irish Ordnance Survey.Petrie’s findings suggested that the hill many have been enclosed by many other ramparts and a line of stones leading up to the entrance which were all gone by then.But, despite his efforts, the expert’s findings remained confined to the records of the Royal Irish Academy, there were no efforts by the organisation to attempt any restoration of the ancient site.It was Dr Bernard who took practical action beyond the analysis of the site. He paid for the entire project that took place between - and recruited his crew of labourers from the farms surrounding Burt. They ferried the materials needed for the restoration on the back up small carts up supplied by the local landowners up the incredibly steep hill.What the doctor found at the site was a disorganised mess of which he said it was: “An immense circular heap of stones, with its grey fallen masonry scattered over the interior-no vestige of a wall, entrance passage, or central building.”Remembering that Walter Bernard was a medical doctor with no detailed description of what an ancient ringfort truly looked like and that there weren’t enough stones on site to complete the job, makes this story even more remarkable.Dr Bernard discovered many animal bones on the site including sheep, cows and goats and items like sling stones and warrior’s clubs. The most interesting stone object discovered was a ‘slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares’, believed to be a games board of some type.The doctor and his crew of labourers used the measurements of other Irish forts such as Staigue Fort in Co Kerry as the comparative basis for the restoration project at Grianan of Aileach. The finished product is a fort that stands . metres in diameter and more than five metres tall with walls that are almost four metres thick.Dr Bernard later described a part of the building project by saying: “To bind our work into a complete unity we had to gather around the hill about  or  loose stones-certainly not more,so many-and to split from the adjoining rocks, cropping up through the heather,  coping stones. These are supposed to serve instead of those removed by King Murdock O’Brien in .”Only speculation can be used to assessthe interior of today’s fort accurately resembles its ancient predecessor, but when the alternative was the complete disappearance of the Iron Age construction, then surely Bernard’s efforts become even more admirable.The fort has stood for centuries as a silent witness to major events of Irish history. From the top of Grianan fort you can just make out the location of the Co Donegal village of Rathmullen on the western bank of Lough Swilly.It was from Rathmullen in  that the chieftains Hugh O’Neill and Rory O’Donnell sailed with their families after the final defeat by the English taking with them the last symbols of the old Gaelic order once enshrined in its pomp by places such as Grianan of Aileach. Behind them in the distance the old fort sat on its hilltop as a fading reminder of a society and its traditions that would never .A legend says that in a secret cave on a hill beneath Grianan O’Neill’s warriors rest in a bewitched sleep in full armour and sitting on their horses ready for the next fight. The spell, says the legend, will only be broken when the next destined leader of Ulster arrives to lead them to victory.It is a myth that would have no visible attachmentit had not been for the passion of Dr Walter Bernard in the late th century in restoring Grianan of Aileach to something approaching its former glory.A tourist road to the fort was opened on September ,  by President of Ireland Eamon De Valera who was accompanied by Fine Gael TD for Donegal West, Pat O’Donnell, then Minister for Local Government. In the early s the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland carried out further repairs to Grianan of Aileacgh after a wall collapsed. But as late as October  the Irish Government was being severely criticised by political representatives in Donegal for still failing to establish tour guides and other facilities at the ancient site.In his obituary contained in the Universities and Colleges magazine of December , , it was reported that Dr Bernard died suddenly at his residence in Buncrana on eight days previously on December . He was -years-old and was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Dr Bernard’s obituary ended: “He leaves a widow. His le was deeply scarred by three great sorrows, the deaths of his three children.”CAPTION: The volunteers involved in the restoration of Grianan of Aileach pictured at its official re-opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"national hunger strike commemoration take place strabane sunday","story":"This Sunday, August , for the first time the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will be held for the first time in Strabane.Thirty-eight years after ten republicans died in Long Kesh during the spring and summer of , thousands of people from across Ireland will march from Lford across the border to the west Tyrone town to remember the prison battle conducted against the Thatcher administration’s policy of criminalisation.Speaking at the announcement that Strabane will host the event, Sinn Fein’s West Tyrone MP Orfhlaith Begley said it was a privilege for Strabane republicans and the rest of the constituency to host the event.“The  hunger strike was a watershed in Irish history and had a profound impact in terms of radicalising communities throughout Ireland. This impact was particularly felt in areas like here in Strabane where pride in the hunger strikers, their courage and sacrice still remains undiminished almost  years on.”The roots of what took place in  began several years earlier, when in  Belfast republican Kieran Nugent became the first man to refuse to wear a prison unorm. In , republicans had been accorded what the British termed Special Category Status recognising the political nature of their offences.By the mid-s however, political status had been withdrawn and as the cages of Long Kesh were replaced by the concrete H Blocks, the new British policy of ‘normalisation’ was wholly designed to strike any notion of political credence away from the IRA campaign.When he entered the H Blocks, Kieran Nugent was instructed to put a prison unorm on by the authorities. He answered, ‘you’ll have to nail it to my back.’ This began five years of protest inside the prison and heightened violence outside it which resulted in dozens of deaths.The blanket and no wash protests of the first four years of the prison conflict yielded no concessions on the issue of political status.The years of isolation and living in dire conditions eventually brought the situation to a head. The choice was plain and stark. The protesting republican prisoners could either concede and serve out jail sentences classed as ‘ordinary criminals’ or escalate the protest to the last ‘weapon’ available to them inside a prison-the hunger strike.It was not a new tactic for the republican movement, and it drew its inspiration from stories from the old Gaelic order.It’s recorded in the annals of Irish history that when a citizen felt slighted by the ruling order, it was not uncommon for them to lie outside their dwelling and refuse food in the hope of publicly shaming the guilty party into reparation and or an apology.In , Thomas Ashe died in Mountjoy prison in Dublin after being force fed whilst on hunger strike demanding political status. Then, in , the Lord Mayor of Cork Terence McSwiney died after  days whilst on hunger strike in Brixton jail. And, next year in  to mark the centenary of the death of McSwiney, the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will take place in Cork city.Back in , Michael Gaughan died in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after  days on hunger strike, and shortly before the beginning of the prison blanket and no wash protests in Long Kesh, in February , another Mayo man, Frank Stagg died at Wakefield jail in Yorkshire after  days without food.The first Long Kesh hunger strike began on October , . The protestors set out a list of five demands: -The right not to wear a prison unorm -The right not to do prison work -The right of free association with other prisoners -The right to organise their own educational and recreational facilities and -The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel a week.Seven men, including Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said they would fast to the death in the pursuit of the re-establishment of political status. Simultaneously, three female republican prisoners also embarked on a strike in Armagh jail.As Christmas  approached, the British offered a deal which appeared to agree to the central demand of the right not to wear a prison unorm. One of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna was close to death at this stage and the strike was called off. It later emerged that was really being offered was a deal to allow prisoners to wear ‘civilian type clothing’ supplied by the prison regime. The scene was therefore already set for a second strike.It began on March ,  when Bobby Sands refused to eat. Raymond McCartney said: “Obviously everybody’s memory of  is the fact that ten people died on hunger strike.“On March ,  the British Government removed political status. I think most people thought that this was a half-hearted attempt and they’d roll over within a short period of time.“But, clearly what was emerging was a complete change in policy by the British Government who were intent on the idea of ‘normalisation’, ‘criminalisation’ and ‘Ulsterisation’.“Instinctively, any of us who found ourselves in prison at that time, knew we were political prisoners and any attempt to criminalise us just wasn’t going to work. It became a battle of wills.“But, I think by the end of the hunger strike in October, , most people looking on were saying that whatever was going on in the North that nobody in their wildest notion thought it was a criminal conspiracy. They certainly saw it as a political conflict. They may not have agreed with the armed actions of the IRA, but they certainly viewed it as a political situation.“So, for us by that stage, the process of criminalisation was in tatters. But, there was a very high price paid because  people had died in prison and  or  people had died on the streets.“Within the prisons we knew that we still had work to do because what we had to do was turn that acceptance of political imprisonment into every day conditions. By the end of the hunger strike I suppose there was a big recognition of the dference between the criminal’s unorm and our own clothes was one manestation of it. And, over the years we continued to ensure the conditions in Long Kesh reflected that.“By the late s and early s, journalists were frequent visitors to the prison and left with the overwhelming impression that we were a ‘dferent type’ of prisoner. They may have gone out and had questions about who you were and what you were about but they were in doubt that we were political prisoners. That was a big source of validation.”The intensity of the events and scale of death and destruction between  and  in retrospect now seems enormous, but Raymond McCartney maintains that it paved the way for future political developments.“It was only five years, but it was a very intense five years. It is only when you get a bit older you realise just how short a time span it was, because when you roll onto  and the Good Friday Agreement there was an acceptance of the framework that there was a political conflict which had to be resolved by political means-the recognition of political mandates, the political framework to address all these issues, but at the core of that was the acceptance of political prisoners.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“There is no doubt there is evidence that there were elements within the British Government were determined that political status should not be granted for whatever reason.“Even in , when there was internment without trial and up to , people were held in conditions where they wore their own clothes. There was a recognition of the political conflict of one nature or another.“How that was defined by dferent people is a dferent matter. I know that other people have made the observation that for too long the British tried to deal with the North as a security issue. therefore, when you have a security mentality or emergency laws, emergency courts, emergency interrogation centres, everything is changed and turned upside down.“If you follow their logic from that point of view and they say ‘you cannot now say you are political prisoners’ whilst trying to pretend that everything  about the situation isn’t political too then the penny drops in a whole lot of ways.”The almost  years since  have provoked much debate within wider nationalism about whether or not the hunger strike was harnessed as a catalyst for the republican movement to embark on the path to politics.The election of Bobby Sands to Westminster and Kieran Doherty to the Dail was followed quickly by a debate within Sinn Fein about ending their policy of abstentionism from political institutions that would lead to a split in the republican movement in . The Derry News asked Raymond McCartney for his view on this.He said: “It is interesting now, because everyone has their story about what the origins of the peace process was. But, there is absolutely no doubt that when you look back as far as  that Gerry Adams that there needed to be a political way of resolving the conflict, because military stalemate was exactly that.“The famous Glover Report from the British Army accepted that there was not going to be a military defeat, was them in their own way, saying the IRA was a political force and that the guys in Long Kesh were political prisoners. They job they were sent to do, they couldn’t do and that was to impose a military defeat and by extension their laws of oppression were not going to work either.“It made the situation painful and made the conflict last longer. Then, whenever the formula for the Good Friday Agreement was put forward, some former prisoners will tell you that it was too high a price to pay, but the core accepted it was a political problem and without political solutions it was never going to be resolved.”When the first hunger strike ended in October of , Raymond McCartney had gone without food for  days. So, what are his own personal recollections of the physical effects of what took place “I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.“In a very strange way hunger strike affects dferent people in dferent ways. Even the day the hunger strike ended in , I was still walking about, I was out of bed. But, there is no doubt that your body slows down.“My ability to see was greatly affected. But, the body is a remarkable piece of equipment and resilience is obviously built in. As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.“I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.

But, there is no doubt that your body slows down. My ability to see was greatly affected.“As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.”Undoubtedly, it was Margaret Thatcher more than anyone  within the British establishment at the time who demonstrated complete determination to use the protests in Long Kesh to ide and break the republican movement.Many commentators have pointed to the INLA assassination of her colleague Airey Neave in  as one reason why the British Prime Minister embarked on a path of total intransigence towards the IRA. However, Raymond McCartney believes that her thinking was a lot wider than that.“Whatever her antipathy towards Ireland was and what came with that, she was setting out a broader political stall. Look at how she treated the miner’s later on.“Reading state papers now, years after these events, her take on the miner’s strike wasn’t just a battle about conditions in the mines, it was about strategically tackling trade unions. It was a case of her saying who is the strongest union-who is the spine of the working class and acting on that.“I always remember that being in jail gives you the time to reflect and read and think and I also always remember that Bobby Sands out of all the people who had been in jail was very clear about what he was there for because he wrote it all down. Some of the things he wrote captures the way a writer works-it’s all encompassing and puts it out there in a very vivid way.“I had previously been interned, I had an understanding about what being a political prisoner was. You had your own clothes and a bit of freedom to associate with other prisoners and you didn’t feel that sense of captivity although you were locked up. Bobby Sands caught on very early that the British were trying to defeat us in the prisons. It wasn’t just about trying to give you a hard time or denying you your own clothes, it was that they had a core idea to break us.“One of the rewarding things for me personally was that the system we had in the end in jail was one based on equality. That we treated people as equals.

To provide housing support services to prevent problems that can often lead to hospitalisation, institutional care or homelessness.And finally, to assist with a smooth transition to those leaving an institutional environment to independent living.Following a review of the Supporting People programme by the Department for Communities in , it was recommended that payment rates across all Supporting People providers should be standardised.The new rates are supposed to ensure all schemes represent value for money.However, UNISON Community Branch members have questioned the commitment of certain employers within the sector.Niall McCarroll, UNISON Community Branch Chairperson said: “The Supporting People Programme has at its core the fundamental desire to improve the quality of le of those in our communities who need housing related support at any particular time.“However, the standards of living and quality of le frontline workers are experiencing does not reflect the work they complete, as a result of substandard terms and conditions of employment increasingly pushing them into debt, putting them at risk of homelessness and forcing them to use foodbanks.”‘Amoral employers’The UNISON delegation attending the Public Consultation impressed upon the NIHE that the current measures in place to protect frontline workers were inadequate and gave “unscrupulous employers” too much power. “Power which they use to disadvantage many workers whilst their inner circles led lavish lestyles on enhance contracts of employment,” Mr McCarroll added.He said the decision-making on how to manage staffing is at the behest of Supporting People funded organisations, this needs to change.UNISON told the NIHE that the current consultation process in place, designed to improve service delivery for vulnerable people would achieve nothing and fall short of any objectives,frontline staff were not valued and respected within the programme.The NIHE estimate that frontline workers should be in receipt of band  hourly rates with no mention of other band  terms and conditions such as sick pay or sht allowances. UNISON challenged this benchmarking estimate and its lack of detail in other areas, stating this was not the reality for many Supporting People Programme workers.Mr McCarroll continued: “A UNISON delegation of frontline workers will be meeting with the NIHE to further discuss our members’ concerns and we thank the NIHE for agreeing to continue the discussions on how best to protect and value workers, not forgetting that we are all involved in this programme to work together changing the lives of vulnerable people.“UNISON would like to put on record our appreciation of the position and approach taken by the NIHE in engaging with the trade unions and our continued disappointment at the right wing, anti-trade union position and approach taken by some Supporting People funded employers.“These employers operate with an arrogant, delusionary sense of entitlement, the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign will expose these employers and continue to organise workers to stand up and fight, bringing to an end the increasingly shaky gravy train which stops only at head office, bypassing frontline services.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"Head office staff receive  months full sick pay while frontline workers receive just  week in any year.  This particular contractual entitlement along with signicant dferences in take home pay is leaving frontline workers feeling undervalued.\"A NIHE spokesperson said the objective of the consultation is to hear the views of service providers, current and potential service users and their families and carers to enable the Housing Executive to identy the best option and approach for implementing this recommendation.The consultation runs for  weeks, it began on  June  and ends  August .Interested stakeholders are invited to participate by completing an online questionnaire at: https:consultations.nidirect.gov.uk nihe-supporting-people srpr"},{"url":null,"title":"waterfoot park residents take council task proposed construction development","story":"Derry City and Strabane District Councilhas pledged to engage fully with a group of residents in the Waterside after they accused the local authority of failing to fulfil their obligations in relation to their objections to a potential building development in their district.In July last year, residents of Waterfoot Park in the city lodged a formal objection to plans for a housing development in the area seeking to construct four semi-detached houses, two detached houses and six, two-bedroomed apartments.The Waterfoot Park residents objected to the proposed development on several grounds which included the potential impact of the construction project on existing properties at the site and that the planning application had not indicated accurate separation and height dferences between the proposed new project and the existing homes.A statement from the Waterfoot Park Residents Objectors Committee to the Derry News said: “The proposed dwellings are three stories in height on ground over two metres higher than the existing houses with restricted separation distances between both.“The layout would result in loss of privacy, natural light, sunlight and overbearing dominance, creating a sense of being hemmed in for us existing residents living adjacent to the boundary line.“Our concerns are also for the natural habitat of wildle species and the overall vast vegetation and trees. No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"prime minister s powys visit","story":"Prime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson talking to County Times Chief Reporter Rory Sheehan..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson and Chris Davies talking to County Times Chief Reporter Rory Sheehan..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson, Iain Burgessand Chris Davies..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengte by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson meeting members of staff..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth carnival 2019 event celebrates","story":"Moon landers : Olivia Garrod , Harry Smithand Izzy Owen ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt drop in on Machynllltspan classtruncate-full-screengteth Carnival.

They opened the scoring through Gareth George and he added a free to give the visitors an early cushion.Indeed, Bright had plenty more chances to add to this score, but were wasteful in their shot selection. The Holywood men finally woke up and a tidy score from Connor McAnespie after  minutes opened their account.Bright again replied with a fine score from Marc Burke before Martin Cox opened his account for Holywood with a point after  minutes. Barry Kilkey levelled the contest three minutes later from close range and Freddie OrsquoConnor scored for Bright to edge them ahead again.Foolish tackling and unnecessary frees were costing St Paulrsquos in the game and helped Bright dominate the play In the first half.The gamersquos opening goal, however, swung the play towards the Holywood men again. Fantastic work from Seaacuten Tucker around the middle of the park and his long ball into the danger area found Marty Cox in space.Cox caught the ball in mid-air, landed and turned in one motion before smashing the ball past Michael Ferrand, who had no chance. The sizable crowd roared with delight and momentum was now with St Paulrsquos as Tucker added another score from play.Once again, however, ill discipline and poor tackling would cost St Paulrsquos.

The game was tied at - to - drawing at  when St Paulrsquosadded their second goal in the th minute.Fine work from Daniel Eastwood and Cox set up Tucker who danced around two Bright defenders before slotting the ball home from  metres. The home crowd were again in raptures, expecting St Paulrsquos to see the game out.However, game management has been a big problem this season for the Holywood men, given the average age of the team is  it is perhaps understandable that experience to see games out is just not there yet.St Paulrsquos tried to slow the game down, but with about  minutes still to be played, it was far too early for that. Bright caught St Paulrsquos in possession on numerous occasionsand turned the ball over for score after score.George was a constant threat and punished each mistake by the Holywood men with a score.

He did, however, admit that the itinerary has been sent to Rome.Venues for the Popersquos visit are pure speculation and certainly newspapers are free to speculate, he added.It is understood that Downpatrick was one of the three venues north of the border suggested by the committee of  bishops, headed by Cardinal OrsquoFiaich, when they met last week.The decision on whether the Pope will include Northern Ireland in his tour will be taken in Rome, but it is believed that alternative venues in the Republic have been suggestedthe Pope decides not to cross the border.The choice of Downpatrick mdash with its strong historical links with Christianity and St Patrick mdash is understood to have been a move to give the Pope the opportunity to see as many people as possible.It is also thought that Armagh mdash the ecclesiastical headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland mdash and Londonderry were studied as possible venues for a visit.Until the programme is finalised, the only places certain to be included in the itinerary are Dublin and the Marian Shrine at Knock, County Mayo.Dr Joseph Maguire, Parish Priest of Downpatrick, said that he personally had not been contacted about any visit from Pope John Paul II, but he admitted that Downpatrick would have been one of the first places to think of.ldquoWe would be delighted to be so honoured with a visit from the Holy Father and he would be most welcome he said.KILLYLEAGH mdash A one-day token strike by production workers closed the Killyleagh Mill yesterday.Around  workers walked out, seeking a wages increase.

Two special zones will be developed for car parking on either side of the beach and a park for upwards of  cars will be provided in the centre, off the beach area.Under no circumstances, however, will cars be allowed to drive up and down the beach area and the council is expected to appoint full-time beach inspectors to supervise parking during the summer season.The private entrances presently used by beach-goers will be blocked off and two new public driveways will be constructed. It is thought that charges for cars to the beach will be scrapped.Other developments at the beach will include the provision of new toilet blocks and the construction of - self-catering holiday homes for renting.NEWCASTLE mdash A new peal of six church bells will ring out over Newcastle this year.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives. I look forward to what we can achieve in the future.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives. I look forward to what we can achieve in the future.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
