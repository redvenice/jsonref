Dogs were kept \u0027inside of a rotting caravan, with a filthy duvet for bedding\u0027 said Ms Wiltshire          Ms Wiltshire claimed bedding was thrown over droppings instead of it being cleaned          Cats were allegedly left to roam free or lived in sweltering caravans and even began \u0027panting\u0027          Because bigger dogs \u0027posed a danger to other animals they were each kept in decaying caravans with small outside runs\u0027          Cats and their litters were kept in cramped caravans with wooden partitions She added: \u0027They (sanctuary owners David and Julia Vaughan) will see my story as a betrayal. Perhaps it is - I feel like it is. But if I kept silence, it would be an even bigger betrayal of the many animals unable to speak up for themselves.\u0027Joanna added that Mr and Mrs Vaughan do care about the animals but said there is no way the couple are able to look after their 200 plus animals that includes ponies, sheep, goats, alpacas, pigs, dogs, cats, chickens, rabbits and guinea pigs.Local resident Whitney Dawson visited the site last month and said: \u0027I\u0027ve never seen anything like it.\u0027          Cats were described as feral and left free to breed at their leisure on the rubbish-strewn site          Joanna said cats that were too young to be mothers gave birth to several litters, like Eeyore (pictured)           Conditions in one of the dogs caravans show a heavily littered ground and stagnant water           Eeyore (pictured) stands out as having had three litters in the space of a year          The former volunteer said rabbits were kept in tiny huts that were rarely cleanedThe 22-year-old added: \u0027It was horrendous. There was rubbish everywhere including broken bricks and mouldy food.\u0027The whole place stank and I had to dump my clothes after leaving one of the caravans because I was covered in fleas.\u0027Some of the dog bowls were full of black stagnant water and there were a lot of abandoned cages and fish tanks. It was just awful.\u0027          The sanctuary, run by David and Julia Vaughan, is moving to a new location after complaints from locals and activists          The yard was strewn in rubbish after the owners upped and left to start fresh at a new site          Residents described seeing dog bowls full of black stagnant water, flea-infested caravans and abandoned fish tanks at the site          It was home to 200 animals, including pigs, goats, chickens, ducks, cats, dogs and turkeys          Outdoor mess at the sanctuary which is moving location after fierce complaints from residentsMr Vaughan responded to those claims and denied any wrongdoing. He reported the site to police - because it was a target of break-ins by animal activists stealing cats.He said: \u0027I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on. They have stolen four of our cats, ransacked the place and cut open a fence.\u0027We needed to leave the cats on the site until we had a suitable home for them at the new site. They have been fed and watered twice-a-day, every day.    \u0027We are doing our best overall. We are on our own and at this 12-14 hours a day.\u0027We\u0027re just here to give a home to animals nobody wants and we wish everyone would leave us alone to get on with our job.\u0027          Shocking pictures reveal squalid conditions at the sanctuary facing fierce criticism from localsJoanna said she had to pay for animal care out of her own pocket on several occasions. She added that she also took a kitten home to care for because its mother couldn\u0027t provide sufficient milk because of inadequate food.  The kitten died less than 24 hours later. Joanna also took videos and pictures of emaciated kittens and others panting with droopy eyes. Joanna described the heat in the caravans as \u0027stifling\u0027 and said she even had to buy a cool pad to offer the kittens some relief. She said: \u0027The cats also suffered with flies as the pens built for them were mostly inside the rotting caravans and were stifling. Cats and kittens were shut in the caravans and panting in the heat.          A petition started by Nicole Knight, says: \u0027Shut down Didcot Animal Sanctuary for good!\u0027          The owners of the site deny any wrongdoing and even claim some of their cats were stolen\u0027Ventilation was poor and there were so many flies that one day I discovered a food bowl literally alive with maggots. It wasn’t just one or two. It was a writhing mass that filled the entire bowl. \u0027The fly situation was not helped by the fact that the cats were not accustomed to litter trays and frequently went in corners of the pen. Sometimes the mess would be cleared up, but often it was dealt with by just throwing a blanket down to hide it.\u0027Joanna added that the RSPCA had made a visit to the site but is \u0027failing the animals\u0027.She said: \u0027In response to public opinion, the sanctuary are re-inventing themselves as a small-holding and are now refusing entry to all members of the public.           A rubbish strewn yard at Didcot Animal Sanctuary in Oxfordshire which has come under fire          David and Julia Vaughan and their mess were blasted in a 1,700 word Facebook post 18 months ago\u0027If action is not taken, this can only mean that things will become even worse as they will have no volunteers to assist them with the daily care of the animals. \u0027The RSPCA have failed these animals. They have inspected at least once and passed them despite seeing the deficiencies in care.\u0027     Mail Online contacted the RSPCA, who said: \u0027We are so grateful to people who report suspected animal suffering to us and we would like to reassure people we will always look into and, if necessary, investigate any complaints made to us about animal welfare.\u0027Unfortunately we are unable to discuss complaints about specific people and what action may have been taken. We understand how frustrating that is for animals lovers but releasing information could prejudice a future investigation or could lead to us being fined.\u0027    "},{"url":null,"title":"Kanye dons MAGA hat Free Hoover sweatshirt final performance SNL","story":"    Kanye West wore a MAGA hat and a Free Hoover shirt for his final performance on SNLKanye West caused a stir on the SNL stage with his fashion choices on Saturday night.The rapper, who hours earlier renamed himself \u0027Ye\u0027, promoted President Donald Trump and \u0027Hoover\u0027 - believed to be jailed gang leader Larry - with his outfits, as he performed three times during the show.In the finale, West was seen in a Make America Great Again Hat as well as a Free Hoover sweatshirt.Earlier this week, the rapper claimed to have redesigned the MAGA hat, by changing the brim and the shape of the front.

We will no longer outsource to other countries. We build factories here in America and create jobs. We will provide jobs for all who are free from prisons as we abolish the 13th Amendment.

He is currently serving six life sentences in Florence, Colorado. The sweatshirt is available for sale at $90 on Kanye\u0027s online store.     Donald Trump took aim at Saturday Night Live once again, after his embattled Supreme Court nominee was made the punching bag for the show\u0027s season premiere          An hour later, Trump seemed to feel confident that he would be able to garner the \u0027Black vote\u0027 It\u0027s not the first time West has shared controversial opinions about slavery. The rapper sparked outrage in May when he called slavery a \u0027choice\u0027 during an interview with TMZ. \u0027When you hear about slavery for 400 years — for 400 years? That sounds like a choice,\u0027 he said. \u0027You were there for 400 years and it\u0027s all of y\u0027all. It\u0027s like we\u0027re mentally imprisoned.\u0027It wasn\u0027t until months later that West finally apologized for the outburst during a radio appearance in late August.West told WGCI he never \u0027approached or addressed the slavery comment fully\u0027 because \u0027it\u0027s not something for me to overly intellectualize\u0027.He then apologized for how his tone and how his actions, including wearing the MAGA hat on several occasions, have affected his fans.            West has spoken in support of Trump on several occasions since he was elected to the Oval Office. The pair are pictured at Trump Tower in December 2016\u0027I\u0027m sorry for the one-two of the MAGA hat into the slavery comment. And I\u0027m sorry for people who felt let down by that moment,\u0027 he said.Fans praised what appeared to be a heartfelt apology, but were in for another let down when West unveiled his redesigned version of the red cap bearing Trump\u0027s 2016 campaign earlier this week. He told Fader that he had added \u0027positive energy\u0027 to the hat by flattening the brim and changing its shape slightly.   Kanye has stunned fans by becoming one of the few celebrities - as well as one of the only prominent African Americans - to support Trump.He went to visit Trump in 2016 shortly after the rapper disappeared to seek mental health treatment.His wife, reality television star Kim Kardashian, has gone twice to see Trump at the White House.Kanye recently promised that a new album, called \u0027Yahndi,\u0027 would come out on Saturday but no work immediately appeared.    Watch exclusive videos of Kanye West¿s visit to The FADER | The FADERKanye West Says His Slavery Comment Abolishing 13th Amendment is Work in Progress | TMZ.com"},{"url":null,"title":"British couple hailed heroes returning 6 200","story":"    Edward Gibson and Jessica Frank have been praised for handing in thousands of pounds in euros which they found while on holiday in GreeceThey told The Sun: \u0027When police took us to meet the lady she was crying and blessing us.

And they are reasonably confident that they and their family can weather an economic shock—like illness or a spell of unemployment—without falling back into extreme poverty.\u0027The middle class are on track to reach 4 billion people worldwide by the end of 2020 – and 5.3 billion by 2030.The majority of people newly entering the middle class live in Asia, with nearly nine in 10 of the next billion middle-class consumers living in that part of the world, spread between China, India, South and South East Asia.The middle class in Asia has largely grown due to the increase in productivity and improved manufacturing technologies at major multinational companies in those countries, Kharas said.          The middle class are on track to reach 5.3 billion people by 2030, according to an analysis by the Brookings InstituteMany businesses in Asian countries have also narrowed their focus on what they produce and sell in order to bring their strongest products to market and become an effective part of what experts call the \u0027global value chain.\u0027For example, in the Philippines, instead of producing a whole car (as in the past), companies there now produce just the electronic hardware and upholstery for vehicles – a change that has made them more profitable to the benefit of their workers and middle class overall. In addition, Asia hasn’t had a currency crisis since 1997 – in which foreign investors and domestic residents took their currency out of national markets, causing currency values to plunge and leading to inflation.\u0027Those kinds of things generate big setbacks for the middle class,\u0027 Kharas said. \u0027In Asia, for the past 20 years there hasn\u0027t been those kinds of setbacks, which has contributed to the growth of the middle class.\u0027 While global development efforts focus on elevating the world\u0027s poorest, just one person is lifted out of extreme poverty every second, while five people enter the middle class every second, according to Brookings.This is important because the middle class is the engine that drives demand in the global economy – and governments listen when the middle class makes demands.In addition, private households account for roughly half of the global economic demand and two-thirds of that comes from the middle class. By comparison, the rich spend more per person but make up such a small proportion of the population that they can\u0027t move the economic needle the way the teeming middle class can.Ultimately, a growing middle class means a stronger global economy and a larger population to be targeted by businesses around the world. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/08/13/4FE0840D00000578-0-image-a-53_1536410217615.jpg","title":"Pregnant girl 16 loses baby never walk getting breast tattooed","story":"    Luisa Fernanda Buitrago, 16, lost her baby and is now in a wheelchair after an the infection from a tattoo spread to her spinal cord           Luisa Fernanda Buitrago lost her baby and has been left in a wheelchair after she had a tattoo on her right breast and the infection spread to her spinal cord Father-of-two, 47, is paralysed and unable to breath without...Teenage footy player who had to learn how to eat again after...Share this articleShe underwent surgery to drain off some of the liquid caused by the infection but then developed problems with her appendix.She then needed further treatment to help her deal with depression caused by the loss of her baby.Miss Fernanda has now spoken out about her experiences on social media to warn other youngsters about the dangers of tattoos.She said: \u0027As I had to take a lot of medicine, I had a miscarriage and lost the son I was carrying.

The service is held by the Dean of Westminster with the reading performed by the Lord Chancellor.The ceremony has been held continuously since the Middle Ages, with the exception of the years 1940 to 1946 because of World War II. In 1953 it was held in St Margaret\u0027s Church because Westminster Abbey was still decorated for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.Before the ceremony, two new justices were sworn in at the supreme court. Alongside Lord Kitchen, Lady Arden took her oath of office and her induction signals the checkpoint that a quarter of supreme court judges are women.

Mr Javid also warned that migrants would have to integrate.‘If you want to come to our country and contribute, great,’ he said, speaking exclusively to the Daily Mail. ‘But in exchange, we expect you to live by our British values and respect our values.’Mrs May, who has made ending free movement a ‘red line’ in her negotiations with Brussels, last night said the proposals would deliver on the referendum vow to take back control of the UK’s borders.‘For the first time in decades, it will be this country that controls and chooses who we want to come here,’ she said.The EU has warned it would respond to the UK ending free movement by stripping Britons of the automatic right to work and live anywhere in the bloc.

Theresa May  said: ‘For the first time in decades, it will be this country that controls and chooses who we want to come here’The immigration system unveiled today will be put in place from January 2021, after the UK’s transition out of the EU is complete. European migrants will have to apply for work visas in the same way as those from the rest of the world.Tourists would remain free to travel to the UK, and business travellers on short trips are expected to face a light-touch regime. The three million EU citizens already living in the UK will have full rights to stay.Ministers will now work with business to establish the level of immigration needed by the economy. But visa applicants will be required to meet minimum salary thresholds before taking a job.There will be ‘temporary’ exemptions for areas of the economy dependent on low-skilled migrants but businesses will be told to train up British workers.Mr Javid said his reforms would result in unskilled immigration from Europe becoming ‘much lower than it is today’.  Sajid Javid and Theresa May, pictured  at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, pledged that far fewer low skilled workers would be let in from Europe after BrexitHe questioned the benefit of large-scale unskilled immigration, saying: ‘It must have some kind of negative impact on wages growth in the UK.’But the Home Secretary insisted Britain would remain ‘a positive, outward-looking nation open to the best talent from across the world’.He added: ‘The immigration system should be very focused on high-skilled people that we might need and dramatically curb low-skilled people coming to our country. And at the same time look across the world.‘If we are talking about a software engineer or a surgeon, to me it doesn’t matter about the nationality of that inidual, it’s not really important. We want the talent and skill that they are going to bring so it shouldn’t matter if that high-skilled person is coming from India, Australia or France. What matters is the skill that they are going to bring to the UK.’          The Home Secretary, a Eurosceptic who backed Remain, said  that the target to slash net immigration to the ‘tens of thousands’ might not last beyond the next electionHe said the target to slash net immigration to the ‘tens of thousands’ might not last beyond the next election.Mr Javid, a Eurosceptic who backed Remain, also waded into the debate over Brexit, hinting that he could switch to backing a Canada-style trade deal if the EU rejected Mrs May’s Chequers plan at this month’s Brussels summit.He batted away questions about his own leadership ambitions but, in a significant move, he defended Mr Johnson, who has come under fire for his outspoken attacks on Chequers.

The 33-year-old American is world’s most famous ‘free solo’ climberThe man who climbed 3,000ft up the sheer face of Yosemite’s...Share this articleDressed in a red T-shirt, tatty grey hiking trousers and wearing a pair of special climbing shoes, all he had with him was a small bag of chalk to prevent his fingers slipping. A single error would, needless to say, have resulted in tumbling to a certain death.The record-breaking 3 hour 56 minute ascent, much of which relied on tiny cracks and hand-holds the thickness of your average HB pencil, has been chronicled in often spine-chilling detail in a National Geographic documentary called Free Solo.Thanks in part to its breathtaking footage of his progress up the climbing world’s most famous and photogenic rock face, the film has gained huge acclaim in the U.S., where it was released last week.Several critics have described it not only as ‘the greatest climbing movie ever made’ but also (with a nudge and a wink) as ‘gripping’.Yet for all Honnold’s derring-do, a hefty portion of the drama being played out that day was unfolding several miles from the picturesque valley where he was dangling by gnarled fingertips.At its centre was his girlfriend Sanni McCandless, who’d driven tearfully away from Yosemite at daybreak, fearing not only that her presence might prove to be a fatal distraction, but also that she might never again see the man she loved.          Alex Honnold,Sanni McCandless \u0027Free Solo\u0027 documentary premiere, Toronto International Film FestivalOn the day itself, June 3, Honnold rolls out of bed at 5 am, eats a bowl of muesli and sets off. In the first hour, he zooms past eight other climbers on El Capitan, all of whom are sleeping on hammocks pinned to the rock-face.Eventually, he finds himself entirely alone. The principal challenge is a section of El Capitan roughly 1,800 feet off the valley floor and known as the Boulder Problem.It consists of a vertical wall that can only be scaled using a handful of tiny holes and ripples in the rock that are several metres apart.‘There are about ten moves on it, and the holds are small and far apart,’ Honnold has said. ‘Only one of them is something you can pull down on.‘When everything’s facing sideways, if your foot slips or if anything happens, you’re shooting off the rock face — no matter how hard you’re holding on.‘It’s what makes the Boulder Problem so tough.’The section culminates in a highly-dangerous ‘karate kick’ manoeuvre during which a climber must launch their entire body across the cliff-face from one hold to another. Should they fail to execute it properly, a fall will almost always ensue.‘The crux of the crux involves this crazy karate kick into this corner, which requires a high degree of flexibility and precision, because you’re kicking at mid-chest height way out to the side, and once your foot’s over there you have to bring your hand over,’ Honnold has explained. ‘It’s just an outrageous sequence.’So concerned was Honnold at his ability to execute the move that he spent one day practising Boulder Section (with ropes) no fewer than 12 times. In the event, he managed it seamlessly.That sets the stage for a traditional Hollywood ending to the documentary. His first act, upon scampering to the summit, is to borrow a mobile telephone, call Sanni and tell her: ‘I love you.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Innocent children Syria going home land never seen","story":"    Hundreds of Syrians leave the Lebanese-Syrian border town of Arsal in Lebanon to make the journey across the mountains and return home to war-ravaged SyriaBut as many spoke of their relief to be heading back to their bombed-out villages, other families were torn apart as some relatives had not got approval to go back.Sobbing, Nouha Bo Ali Haj, 14, said she was returning from a camp on the outskirts of Arsal with her father – but not her mother, who is waiting for approval.Asked why she was crying, she said: \u0027I am going to miss my mother.\u0027Iran fires missiles with \u0027Death to America, Israel and Al...London mother, 26, who took her one-year-old daughter to...Share this articleRimi Bo Ali, 50, said: \u0027I registered but my name has not come back.\u0027She said her family had been forced to leave their home in the town of Fleta, just across the border, in 2014 and added: \u0027We are living in a camp – it is better for us to live in a house.

But it was Kode9’s sub-bass that brought tears to my eyes, not the searing smell in the roomIt begins with a low but overwhelming rumble, from a stack of speakers at the back of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall. Forty thousand watts of sub-bass and dialled-down beats roll through the space and through my guts, courtesy of Steve Goodman, aka Kode9, musician and founder of Hyperdub records – and producer of the dubstep artist Burial. Like Burial’s music, the soundscape feels as much physical and internal as aural. More threatening than ambient, it is a kind of melancholy assault. Is this why people are in tears, as they wander, sniffling, from a small, brightly lit side room? Someone stamps a number on the back of my hand as I go in. I think it reads 926577101000 – which seems weird – but the number is fading now. It is a memory of bodies, the number going up with each visitor. It is also an ascending number recording the number of people who last year migrated from one country to another, plus the number of migrant deaths recorded between the start of Tania Bruguera’s project and today. I find this somewhat confusing. In fact, Bruguera’s commission – apparently titled after this escalating figure and thus changing all the time – is full of complications, some more visible than others.“This room contains an organic compound that makes you cry” says the sign. Is Boris Johnson in there? Brett Kavanaugh? Some other revolting organic compound in human form? The room is empty, but for a searing smell of camphor or eucalyptus. It is like bathing in Olbas oil or a tub of Vicks chest emollient. It didn’t make me cry but it cleared the tubes. Kode9’s sub-bass is having a similar effect on my intestines, but that too could be a reference to the recent, invisible sonic attacks purportedly experienced by US diplomats in Bruguera’s native Cuba. Maybe we are meant to think of teargas in this little chamber, but I take it as a kind of chemically induced empathetic reaction, a way of bringing visitors together.The Turbine Hall’s concrete has also been paved with glossy, black-painted interlocking metal sheets, as unpleasantly bituminous and shiny as tar. I wondered, briefly, if this were a Liberate Tate comment on BP’s sponsorship of the arts.In the rear part of the space, beyond the ramp and the first floor bridge and in front of Kode9’s speakers, another area of the floor, bigger than a tennis court, has been overpainted a flat, uniform grey. People are lying around, and pressing their hands to the floor. The imprint of their bodies and palms lingers on the grey and seems almost to glow with ghostly afterimages. I am reminded of Yves Klein’s Anthropometries, where the artist pressed women’s bodies, covered in blue paint, on canvases, or used them as living stencils, spraying around them. The floor-paint is heat-sensitive. I imagine visitors having a lot of fun with this, making fanciful, quickly fading group imprints on the grey, just as visitors to Olafur Eliasson’s 2003 Turbine Hall commission used their bodies as a kind of human alphabet, writing messages that were reflected in the mirrored roof. It is always selfie-time in the Turbine Hall. The black paint on the ramp is heat-sensitive, too.Bruguera’s Hyundai commission is a complicated affair. If enough people heat up the floor, an image appears, a blown-up portrait of a young asylum seeker who arrived from Syria in 2011. His image was selected by local activist Natalie Bell, and Bruguera has renamed Tate Modern’s Boiler House galleries in her name. All the gallery signage – on the walls, in the lifts, and in gallery publicity material now bears Bell’s name, and will do for the next year.Bruguera’s commission is extended by her work as lead artist for Tate Exchange (following Tim Etchells and Clare Twomey), working with 21 Tate Neighbours, members of a group who all live or work in the postcode around Tate Modern. This is more than a spin-off project. Both through their activities in the Tate Exchange galleries, in manifestos and statements that appear when you log on to Tate Modern’s wifi system, Tate Neighbours are asking visitors to engage in activism, focusing on “civic responsibilities and selfless actions”.Doubtless some of this will filter through. Bruguera’s project certainly asks more than SUPERFLEX’s stupid swings did in the last Hyundai commission. She wants to bring people together, to make us cry, to reveal an image through our collective presence and the heat of our bodies. She wants us to think of Tate Modern in relation to its locale, with all the social contradictions of its immediate surroundings. The doomy rumbling bass is perhaps a bulwark against visitors experiencing the latest Turbine Hall project as just another bit of flimsy entertainment. It is a bit unhinging, an intimation of the horrors around us, the horrors ahead. But who knows? Perversely, on a visceral level I like it a lot. But the project as a whole feels somehow unfocused. The overall aim is I think to give us a sense of communality, but instead it feels fragmented.• Tania Bruguera’s Turbine Hall commission is at Tate Modern, London, until 24 February 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a27cf67debb62da9788f7d823420441b1c37746c/0_0_4056_3040/master/4056.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2d9059a750499d22e64ad1bba8fc7db 1010w","title":"matilda at 30 roald dahl quentin blake","story":"Standup comedian, astrophysicist or author: what would Roald Dahl’s book-loving psychic have become? Children’s authors imagine her future, alongside new illustrations by Quentin BlakeIt is 30 years exactly since Matilda, Roald Dahl’s novel about a brave little girl who loves books and hates bullies, was first published. To celebrate this anniversary, eight new illustrations of Matilda by Dahl’s longtime illustrator Quentin Blake are revealed for the first time.Blake was only asked by Matilda’s current publishers, Puffin, to create one sketch, showing what she would be up to as a 30-year-old. Instead, the 85-year-old decided to create eight, three of which appear on the covers of the 30th anniversary editions. “I have had a lot of fun imagining what that little girl might be doing now she’s all grown up,” Blake writes in a new foreword. “Since, as a small child, Matilda was gifted in several different ways, it wasn’t very difficult.”To celebrate her birthday, we asked six children’s authors to imagine what Matilda would be doing at 30 – and asked how her childhood would have influenced her character and behaviour as an adult.Michael Rosen: ‘She’d be a standup comedian – and do an incredible impression of Miss Trunchbull’I think Matilda at 30 would be a very successful standup comedian. Comedians are quite vulnerable people, in my experience, and I think Matilda would have been scarred by her parents. Though she had saved herself, it would have made her very raw. If you got too close, she might tongue-lash you a little bit.Comedy would help relieve her of the hurt her parents inflicted on her, a way to kind of love them. She knows Virginia Woolf off by heart and draws on this whole hinterland of literature during her act. She shows her own fallibilities and hopes on stage, which is something I think good comedians are really good at doing.She would do an incredible impression of Miss Trunchbull but also of Miss Honey, whom she’d present as too good to be good: “What’s the point of that?” she’d ask the audience. She go off into a whole riff about her telekinesis: “Oh by the way, when I was a kid I could make a water jug move.” She would talk about it in a way that would leave you not knowing what was real and finish with: “And then a teacher threw one of the kids out of the window.” And you would half-believe her.Tragically, Miss Honey is dead. She fell off the side of a boat in a fjord in Norway while looking for Roald Dahl, when Matilda was in her 20s. So now there is an inner sadness in Matilda, which she hides. Doing comedy helps her keep her feelings of sadness at bay.• Michael Rosen’s latest book Reading and Rebellion: An Anthology of Radical Writing for Children 1900-1960 is out now.Francesca Simon: ‘She would not be an explorer or a scientist. She’d have a job around books’When I think of Matilda, I think of books. Books are the main part of her life and make her life worthwhile. And although she’s brave and comfortable in her own skin, she’s introverted. She’s a person who likes to sit in an armchair and read.So there’s no doubt in my mind that, at 30, she would not be an explorer or a scientist. She’d have a job around books – maybe running a bookshop, working as a children’s librarian or, at a stretch, being an education minister.As an adult, she would have a great capacity for happiness because she has survived situations that would crush most children. She’s still an extraordinarily fast reader and by now, she will have read everything. Sharing books is what gives her joy.She continues to be strong-minded but she’s probably quite shy, one of those quiet people who is a really good listener. I can also see her being a passionate advocate for libraries and spearheading a campaign to ensure that every school has a library. She would force herself to come out of her quietness to do that.• The opera based on Francesca Simon’s book The Monstrous Child opens at the Royal Opera House in February 2019.Ed Vere: ‘She would have been prime minister for a couple of years at least by now’Matilda was precocious so I think at the young age of 30, she would have been prime minister for a couple of years by now. She had a great sense of right and wrong so on her way into power, I think she would have enlisted the help of the army to dangle Jacob Rees-Mogg, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, George Osborne and David Cameron from helicopters and take them over the sea to an island. There, she would have had them dropped into a very, very deep pit.At the bottom of that pit, I feel sure that there would have been an enormous crocodile who hadn’t eaten for a very long time. Hence there would never have been any mention of Brexit or referendums.With Matilda at the helm, we would now be living in a peaceable country where all are at ease with each other. School libraries would have been a huge priority for her and libraries across the country would be blooming and full of people. Education would be at the heart of everything, and art and music would flourish again in schools. Matilda would know that it’s important to educate whole human beings, not cogs to fit into economies.• Ed Vere’s new book, Goodnight, Max the Brave, will be published on 4 October.Matt Haig: ‘She would be writing her own version of  Game of Thrones’Matilda’s very self-reliant, so I think at 30 she would be doing precisely what she wanted to do. She wouldn’t rule the world, because she wouldn’t want to.I think she would be a writer, writing something vast and epic but not realistic, because she’s got such a good imagination. Maybe she would be writing her own version of Game of Thrones, or a harrowing memoir of her childhood. She’s got a lot of demons. But books would be her therapy so she wouldn’t have to be on medication or have counselling. Books will continue to be her salvation.I don’t know if she would be happy. I saw Matilda as a child as a very yearning kind of person. I feel like, as an adult, she would know happiness, but she wouldn’t be totally satisfied. She would still be on a quest for stories.• Matt Haig’s new children’s book, The Truth Pixie, will be published on 18 October.Jeff Kinney: ‘She’d work in a bookstore – but she would not be the owner’I think she would be working in a bookstore with a robust children’s section. She would not be the owner. In the book, she’s distrustful of adults. I see management as a grey figure behind her, while Matilda is the one actually putting the book in the child’s hand. I think Matilda would know that that’s a sacred act. That’s what would drive her.She’s very curious and adventurous so, in her 20s, I think she would have bounced around the world, having a taste of everything. She’s spent time on an oil rig in Norway and tracked great white sharks in South Africa. But she’s come back home to live with Miss Honey again, because she wants to always be close to her.In her spare time, she writes fantasy books for young adults aged 12 to 15. Not because she wants to become a published writer, but to nurture a child who reminds her of herself – maybe an underprivileged kid she met in the bookstore one day. She would write just for that kid, to open up new worlds for them. She would write stories for dreamers.• Jeff Kinney’s new book Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Meltdown will be published on 30 October.Kate Pankhurst: ‘Matilda would co-found a school for children with special powers’Along with Miss Honey, 30-year-old Matilda would co-found a school for children with special powers such as telekinesis, whose potential is not being tapped. It would appear to be a normal school, but Matilda would have a secret mission to find children with unusual talents, seeking out stories in newspapers and on TV. It would be a very stimulating, creative school where the children would get to make the most of their talents and do what they most enjoy.Miss Honey would be the headmistress and Matilda would be the school librarian. Perhaps she would appear a bit reserved when you first meet her, but that would change once you got to know her and realise how warm and caring she is. Even at 30, she would still have a love of playing tricks, so the kids would know if anyone messed with her she would think up a cunning and unusual way of getting back at them. But it definitely would not be the Chokey.• Kate Pankhurst’s book, Fantastically Great Women Who Made History, is out now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6fd82c57bbb5d9f81a297925ca2b68b72951cec/0_83_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a578a68f78242c003e3155877d4fbd32","title":"sports direct house of fraser senior management mike ashley","story":"Dismissal follows calls for investigation into department store chain’s collapseSports Direct, which is controlled by the tycoon Mike Ashley, has dismissed the former directors and senior management of House of Fraser, less than two months after buying the department store group from its administrators.In a brusque statement issued to investors after the London stock market closed on Monday, Sports Direct said: “Following the collapse of House of Fraser on August 10 2018, and subsequent calls for an investigation into the circumstances of that collapse, the company today announces that we have dismissed the former directors and senior management of House of Fraser.”Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United Football Club, bought the department store out of administration for £90m in August.

They need a new leader. Some new faces around the cabinet table.Some flashy new policies. And, everyone agrees, they need to stop flicking V-signs at business. But nothing too radical. An oil change, a spray job, and they’ll be motoring again.Political wisdom is often little more than sonorous simple-mindedness, and this is a prime example. Judging by Philip Hammond’s speech to the Tory faithful on Monday, the chancellor doesn’t buy it, either. Humming through his lines was an anxiety about the threat posed by Jeremy Corbyn. Whatever their press releases say, cabinet ministers are stumbling through the Tory conference in Birmingham worried that Labour’s arguments about Britain’s broken economy are hitting home. And with good reason.The Tories sense this widespread pessimism – they just haven’t a clue what to do about it. Party activists in Birmingham this week willingly bet that this conference is Theresa May’s last as leader while voicing no confidence that whoever succeeds her will do any better.“We are a dead party,” says Nick Denys, a councillor from Hillingdon and head of policy for the Tory Workers group, whose other members include Ruth Davidson and Robert Halfon. “Even our membership is literally dying. What do we have to offer families of working age?” And that is a key question. Because the problems facing this party are fundamental – and they have been made by Tories.Smack-bang in the middle of a crisis of capitalism, May has positioned the Tories as the stalwarts of capitalism. While the country cries out for more money, she carries on cutting spending. Such astounding blockheadedness is compounded when the prime minister who told a struggling nurse last year that “there is no magic money tree” boasts this week of her plans for a £120m festival of Brexit. You can see the damagedone by May right outside the conference hall where she will speak on Wednesday. West Midlands mayor Andy Street says the cuts “have gone far enough” local police say they are close to “breaking point”. Big West Midlands businesses such as the carmaker Jaguar Land Rover warn of the harm that would be done by a no-deal Brexit.Underlying this is the deep-rooted problem that the programme pushed by the Conservatives since the 1980s simply hasn’t worked for the very people who used to vote for them. Margaret Thatcher promised a shareholder democracy – but inidual ownership of shares is below where it was when she began her privatisations. She pledged a country of homeowners – but home ownership in England has fallen to its lowest point since 1985.What Tory policies have done is concentrate wealth, power and opportunity in ever-fewer hands – thus cannibalising their voter base. Party grandees sometimes talk about an electoral ladder from youthful firebrand to grey-haired Conservatism. You get a job, you buy a house, get into middle management – and as you get more of a stake in society you become more reactionary. Or so the theory goes. Except every one of those rungs is now broken. Graduates can’t get graduate-level jobs. Settling down is almost impossibly expensive. No wonder the natural age of Labour voters keeps rising.To see how this works in practice, ignore the autocued remarks made in Birmingham this week and think about another speech, made three years ago by a woman in the audience for Question Time. Perhaps you remember Michelle Dorrell: dressed in a grey jacket and minding her Ps and Qs, she suddenly exploded at the then-cabinet minister Amber Rudd for defending cuts in tax credits.Dorrell told Rudd that she’d voted Tory six months earlier – but now she was furious. “I work bloody hard for my money to provide for my children … and you’re going to take it away from me and them. I can hardly afford the rent, the bills and you’re going to take more from me.” And audience members in Dover started chanting at Rudd: “Shame on you! Shame on you!”At the time, I wrote on these pages that that was a seminal moment in the politics of austerity: the point at which the government could no longer pretend that the cuts were happening only to shirkers. And Dorrell was exactly the kind of natural Tory voter the party could ill afford to lose.Dorrell told me this weekend that she’d never planned to go off like that, but when Rudd spoke she felt “a force from inside my belly”. She’d lost her job in 2011, had to go through the horror of the benefits system and then retrained and set up a nail bar. She’d played it by the book, done everything the Tories told her to do – and still she was, to use an old phrase, just about managing. Instead of birthday and Christmas presents, her dad would buy £100 of food from Sainsbury’s or Lidl and restock the fridge.At first business went well, but the economy in her hometown of Folkestone is as moribund as anywhere else in non-metropolitan Britain. She’s just closed her nail business and works in a local shop on a zero-hours contract, getting eight to 12 hours of shifts a week. She needs more, but the manager says the company will never give her 16 hours because they don’t want to pay employers’ national insurance. She still needs benefits to top up wages, yet the benefits system keeps getting meaner. In April 2011, 6.4 million families were on tax credits, according to Carl Emmerson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. By this April that was down to 3.8 million: of those losing out, a tiny number may have moved to universal credit – but many millions more simply got poorer.Dorrell, who is in her late 30s, describes herself as “a child of Thatcherite economics”. Her parents are Tory, her hometown is Tory. And in the 1980s, someone like her might have gone along with the Conservatives’ promises. In the last couple of years she’s become radicalised, joining Labour and Momentum.She talks about local GP surgeries closing and overcrowding in classrooms. Talking to me, she looks out of her bedroom window on to a car park where drug dealers hang about. Her children are still playing by the rules – and getting punished for it. Her eldest daughter is at university, set to graduate with £65,000 of debt. For her children, austerity is all they’ve known – at home, in the classroom, at the start of their working lives. What the winter of discontent was to the Labour party for a decade – the indelible stain, the warning at the ballot box – the decade of cuts may prove to be for May’s party. “The Tories are screwed for a generation, aren’t they?” says Dorrell. “My kids will grow up knowing they’ve been screwed over by that lot.”• Aditya Chakrabortty is a  columnist and senior economics commentator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f96feb14269a9a4129cc1df896df502e61bd44c/0_130_3898_2339/master/3898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81272aff84073b0ed2405492699aedc8","title":"stella mccartney boss paris fashion week","story":"Focus on accessories at Paris fashion week suggests the brand has its eye on the commercial prizeFor the first time in her 21 years at Paris fashion week, Stella McCartney took her catwalk bow not only as designer, but as the sole owner and unchallenged boss of the brand.“I have lived and breathed this brand all along,” she said. “It’s always been my name above the door, my face as the face of the brand. So for me nothing has really changed, but I think what it has done is given everyone else on the team a boost. It’s bold, it’s exciting and it’s put a spring in everyone’s step.”McCartney’s aesthetic oscillates between the dreamily bohemian and the athletically urban. This season she was in a punchy mood, and swerved toward the latter. The show opened with a neoprene playsuit, conjoining a swimsuit top half with cycling shorts, covered in bold blue flowers.Next was an off-white trouser suit that oozed the savoir-faire McCartney brings to her suiting, for men and women. (There was even a ticket pocket, that extra smaller pocket located just above the waist on the right-hand side of the jacket, which is a classic Savile Row touch.) Jumpsuits, a Stella staple, came as silky flight suits and organic denim boilersuits.McCartney does not use leather, on moral and environmental grounds, a stance that for a long time was assumed to be a significant brake on her business ambitions. But sustainability is casting off its worthy image and becoming increasingly inseparable from aspiration – there being few concepts more fundamentally aspirational than the survival of the planet – and Stella-logoed handbags, in every shape from backpacks to totes, were impossible to miss on a catwalk where several models carried more than one. The focus on accessories suggested that the brand has its eye firmly on the commercial prize.The designer’s newly minted “girlboss” status felt significant at a Paris fashion week at which the premier talking point has been an about-turn at Céline, where the female-friendly aesthetic of Phoebe Philo has been upended by the new designer Hedi Slimane.“Is a woman’s point of view relevant at fashion week? You’d hope so, wouldn’t you?” said McCartney after her show, but she was reluctant to be drawn further. (Without getting snarled in the annals of fashion history, McCartney’s positioning vis-a-vis Céline is complicated by a rivalry with Philo, who was once her assistant.) “For me, it’s always been about equality between men and women,” she said. “Our brand is about allowing someone to be confident in themselves, whoever they are.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/445c337b532313bdcc72c67331e291db88109b3c/0_0_8049_4828/master/8049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a55ccc31f050ff22e2d2eb9ff559c534","title":"harry meghan wedding chef michelin stars clare smyth","story":"Core restaurant by Clare Smyth wins double accolade in guide for Great Britain and IrelandClare Smyth, who catered for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s evening wedding reception, has been awarded two stars for her first solo venture, Core, in the 2019 Michelin guide for Great Britain and Ireland.The accolade for the restaurant in Notting Hill, west London, which opened in July 2017, is the latest achievement for Antrim-born Smyth, who, in July this year, was named the world’s best female chef and last year won the Michelin Guide’s inaugural award for best female chef.Smyth, a protege of Gordon Ramsay, was greeted on stage at the BFI Imax in central London with a kiss from her former boss. She told the audience of 400 people, including 180 chefs: “It makes it obviously even more special that Gordon’s handing it to me … It’s been a hell of a year. We’ve achieved what we really set out to achieve.”The lack of women at the top was highlighted by the fact that only one other restaurant with a female head chef – Sabot, in Mayfair, central London, where Nieves Barragán is in charge – was awarded any new stars in the 2019 guide.Smyth told the : “It’s nice to be out there and doing it for female chefs. We just need to encourage more women to come into the industry and if I can help inspire other people to do that, I think it makes our whole industry better.”Commenting on the fact that only one other female head chef was honoured at the ceremony, she said: “It’s probably a reflection of the number of women in the industry. We need more women to come into the industry.”Ramsay said: “She’s tremendous – she’s the Margaret Thatcher of cooking. She knows what she wants and she comes from a good stable. To get two stars straight away – there are chefs who have been cooking for 30 years and haven’t got two stars – is a testament to her capabilities.”Smyth, who catered for 200 people at the royal wedding evening reception on 19 May, was made an MBE in 2013 for services to the hospitality industry. She served “posh burgers” and pork belly with candy floss for guests including Sir Elton John, the Beckhams, George and Amal Clooney, and Serena Williams.Smyth left her family’s farm between Ballymena and Belfast when she was 16 to study catering at Highbury college in Portsmouth. She then worked at Sir Terence Conran’s Michelin House restaurant, the French Laundry in California and Per Se in New York, before becoming chef patron at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in 2007.At Restaurant Gordon Ramsay she became the first and only female chef to run a British restaurant with three Michelin stars – one of only seven women globally to have held the coveted rating. The Michelin inspectors said they were “bowled over by the depth of flavour … all of your cooking delivers”.Two other restaurants were newly awarded two stars, though unlike Core, both Moor Hall in Aughton, west Lancashire, and Kitchen Table at Bubbledogs in Fitzrovia, central London, previously had one star.In all, 21 restaurants were newly awarded one star and three were newly awarded two stars, which is believed to be a record. There were no restaurants reaching four in the UK, and 100 or so globally that have three stars.Reflecting a growing trend, a number of pubs – or former pubs – were awarded one star, including the Chestnut in west Cork, one of three places in the Irish city to get a star, and the White Swan just outside Burnley in Lancashire.Brat also won a star, having opened in a former strip club in Shoreditch, east London, where it offers Basque-style cooking over an open fire.There was also a star for Salt in Stratford-on-Avon, which was launched after a kickstarter campaign. The head chef, Paul Foster, said: “I took a risk, left my job, told my wife – she wasn’t very happy … we got a hundred grand, we put everything into the restaurant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6575c4dfd08dce9385da44044edcfbde1d6caa2a/390_447_7674_4604/master/7674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c33c5efb4d7cbae9adb0fdf055c16d06","title":"thomasina miers recipe for tomato and chicken traybake","story":"Be inspired by the gutsy, rich cooking of the MediterraneanI have a friend with an extraordinary kitchen garden in Suffolk. All summer, her many tomato plants have been in their element, with ripe fruit hanging heavily from their branches, wafting their sweet aroma all around.

If you want a looser consistency, add a few more slugs of olive oil. Taste and check for seasoning – it will be naturally salty so you may only need the smallest pinch of salt.Once the thighs are golden and cooked through, serve in the baking tray, drizzled with the basil oil, or transfer to a serving dish.

A late penalty, awarded after Mamadou Sakho flung an arm clumsily into Jefferson Lerma as the hosts swung a hopeful free-kick into the box, had lifted Bournemouth to within two points of the top four in the fledgling Premier League table. For Crystal Palace, now beaten four times, the picture looks grimmer.It was the carelessness of the concession that must have infuriated Roy Hodgson. His team had fought their way back to parity, albeit with a goal that a VAR would have ruled out for offside, only for their tempo to drop just as the game was there to be won, inviting late pressure as a result. Wayne Hennessey had done wonderfully well to deny Callum Wilson with his left leg, the striker having scurried on to Ryan Fraser’s pass beyond a ramshackle backline, and then to parry Dan Gosling’s header from a centre. The pivotal free-kick was awarded against Alexander Sorloth in the confusion that followed, with Palace’s composure having drained away.That did not excuse the offence. Sakho had already shoved Lerma away as the teams jostled for position on the edge of the penalty area waiting for Fraser’s delivery, earning a warning from the referee, Mike Dean. Surely it was obvious the official would be scrutinising that duel when the dead-ball was eventually taken, yet the Frenchman still glanced and flung back his elbow and forearm to connect with the Colombian while the ball sailed harmlessly into the penalty area. Junior Stanislas, a substitute who had yet to have a touch, grabbed the ball and converted the spot-kick.Everything Palace mustered thereafter was played out through a red mist. Hodgson claimed the free-kick conceded had been “needless” but suggested Sakho’s misdemeanour had been clumsy rather than malicious. “Mamadou has no intention to elbow the player, or use the elbow to stop the player getting to the ball,” he said. “But I can’t deny that, when you see it on the television, he does catch the player and, as a result, the referee is quite within his rights to award the penalty.” Howe, relieved his team’s furious opening and energetic finale had secured the points, had not seen a replay of the incident.He could revel in a hard-fought win, with the tweaks he had made to his side after Palace’s equaliser having had the desired effect. There was plenty to admire in their display through two spells of superiority. Their opening had threatened to blow the visitors away, when Josh King and Wilson were unsettling James Tomkins and Sakho, and Fraser and David Brooks drove Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Patrick van Aanholt back into their shells. Brooks in particular caught the eye and it was the Wales international – who won best player at the 2017 Toulon Tournament while with England – whose first Bournemouth goal had put Bournemouth ahead.The winger had already fizzed one low centre across the six-yard box by the time Adam Smith, operating from left-back, scuttled down the flank and squared for Wilson five minutes in. The striker, with his back to goal, calmly laid the ball across the area where Brooks, in space away from Van Aanholt, whipped a fine first-time shot beyond Hennessey and in off the crossbar.“He’s a goalscorer in waiting, so that was a big moment for him,” said Howe of his £11.5m signing from Sheffield United. “He’s not been overawed or phased. He’s attacked it. That’s a very special thing to do at such a young age.”Palace at least recovered some poise, even if they only really clicked for a 20-minute period either side of the interval when their midfield, with Max Meyer eager to accept possession on his first top-flight start and Luka Milivojevic more like his old self at the German’s side, wrested back some level of control. That spell yielded their goal, Wilfried Zaha spinning in possession to slip Van Aanholt beyond Simon Francis. The Dutchman was in an offside position as he glided free but, with no assistant’s flag forthcoming, checked back inside and ripped a right-foot finish emphatically into the top corner via Asmir Begovic’s fingertips.Yet that was only this side’s fifth of the campaign and, with Zaha swamped by markers and not given a presentable opportunity all evening, they appear worryingly toothless. Jordan Ayew is industrious but hardly a predator. James McArthur, asked to push forward from midfield, has snatched at his half-chances to date this season. It is at times like these when a Christian Benteke-shaped hole gapes in their lineup, even if he is a player whose confidence is brittle after only three goals in 34 top-flight appearances. There is currently no presence to alarm opposing defenders. The hope is the knee injury which has hampered the Belgian of late will have cleared up after the international break. For all that his critics will protest, Palace are weakened without him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40b782dc88540ebb0ca0647585b2e1c329e8ee83/0_17_2352_1410/master/2352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b57e3e20103054fd1154ffc9a5e93d85","title":"cristiano ronaldo accuser spells out claims in magazine","story":"Kathryn Mayorga talks to German magazine about allegations that footballer raped her in 2009Kathryn Mayorga, the woman who alleges that Cristiano Ronaldo raped her, has revealed extensive details of the events she claims took place in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.The 34-year-old teacher claims the superstar footballer forced her to have sex with him in the bathroom of his penthouse suite, despite repeatedly being told not to. Mayorga also revealed the protracted legal process by which she subsequently agreed to settle the claims. It was an agreement which, her lawyers claim, was never honoured by Ronaldo and contains documents that prove he knew she had not consented.Ronaldo has vehemently denied all the allegations.Mayorga said in an interview with Der Spiegel magazine that she had chosen to go public in the wake of the #MeToo revelations. By breaking her end of the agreement, she may now face the possibility of having to pay back $375,000 awarded to her eight years ago, on top of legal fees, in an out-of-court settlement reported by Der Spiegel.The alleged assault occurred in the summer that Ronaldo left Manchester United for Real Madrid to become the then most expensive player in the world. He went on to enjoy unparalleled success in Spain, forging a reputation as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport. He captained Portugal to victory in the European Championships of 2016 and this summer completed a £90m transfer to Juventus in Italy.In the interview, Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo met her in a nightclub, Rain, where she was working and invited her back to his hotel room. He then forced her to have anal sex with him after she had rebuffed a series of advances.“Basically he ... he begged me to touch his penis for 30 seconds,” she said. “I was laughing at him because I thought, ‘Is this a joke? This guy that is so famous and so hot ... he’s a frickin’ loser and a creep.’”Mayorga said she agreed to kiss Ronaldo on the understanding he would then leave her alone, but that instead he increased his assertiveness and began groping her, before finally forcing her into sex. She claimed she said no several times, but he ignored her.“After he assaulted me, he wouldn’t let me leave again. He wouldn’t let me leave”, Mayorga told Der Spiegel.Mayorga allegedly filed a complaint with Las Vegas police the next day. But she refused to name her assailant. She says she was then in shock for three months before ultimately determining to draw a line under the matter by agreeing to a settlement.The many documents that comprised this agreement included questions asked of Ronaldo by his own lawyers. According to Der Spiegel, an earlier version of the questionnaire he was asked to fill out allegedly includes an admission from Ronaldo that “she said no and stop several times”. It is not known whether such an admission was included in the final version of the questionnaire.As part of the settlement, Mayorga allegedly wrote a letter to Ronaldo that his lawyers were obliged to make sure he had read within a fortnight of the agreement. It is asserted by Mayorga’s lawyers, Der Spiegel reports, that this commitment was never fulfilled.According to Der Spiegel, the money that was paid to Mayorga as part of the settlement came from a bank account in the tax haven of British Virgin Islands, registered to a company that had held Ronaldo’s earnings from advertising and sponsorship.Ronaldo categorically denies all the allegations and says that sex between the pair was consensual.Ronaldo’s lawyer, Christian Schertz, said the Spiegel report “is manifestly illegal and violates the personal rights of our client Cristiano Ronaldo in an extremely serious way” and is “one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25c6409216baa5a98690a8af29da3939522a1035/0_95_3492_2095/master/3492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd31ee8219188c4f5f5925532af1c8dc","title":"jose mourinho manchester united valencia champions league","story":"From the selection of personas available to him in times of alleged crisis, José Mourinho chose the sunny, upbeat one for the press conference ahead of the Champions League meeting with Valencia that could, theoretically, turn into his last game in charge.He wore white instead of black, the smile was on full beam, he helpfully held up his phone and pointed out the man from the Sun when a Spanish reporter asked whether Zinedine Zidane had really been in touch, and in response to another Iberian question about whether he was failing at Manchester United he made a joke about being on the same level as their beloved Atlético Madrid.Was this a big week for Manchester United? “If it is the Champions League it is always a big week and a good week,” Mourinho said. “Not everyone gets to play Champions League games so you should always look forward to them even if you are expecting a difficult match.”Valencia are even lower in the La Liga table than United are in the Premier League and on current form would not ordinarily be regarded as difficult opponents, though it is the wretched form recently shown by Tuesday’s hosts that could be the greater factor in the contest.Not only have United just managed to get knocked out of the Carabao Cup at home against Derby of the Championship, on Saturday they contrived to make West Ham look like world‑beaters, which must have been a bigger surprise to Manuel Pellegrini than the goals gifted to his side at Goodison on his 65th birthday.United are nine points off the title pace just seven games into the season, and to outside eyes at least Mourinho seems to have compounded their worst start for 29 years by conducting public feuds with his players. Paul Pogba was substituted at the weekend and Alexis Sánchez dropped altogether, the Chilean reportedly furious about being taken to London and made to sit in the stands.Perhaps more damaging still are the suggestions that United’s present lethargy – statistics showed they made fewer sprints at West Ham than any other team in the Premier League last weekend – might be a deliberate attempt to undermine the manager’s position. The conclusion being drawn is that what happened to Mourinho in his final season at Chelsea is happening all over again in Manchester, though that could be an oversimplistic analysis.The manager has given his players public backing, claiming he has never known a dishonest professional, and asked them to step up their performances against Valencia. So the proof should be in the pudding.“The manager is trying to turn this around, he wants to make us stronger,” said Nemanja Matic, a player who was at Chelsea with Mourinho the last time things went awry and one who declined to comment on whether he was experiencing any sort of deja vu.“It’s not my job to analyse that,” the midfielder said diplomatically. “The players all know the situation is not good and we know we can do better. Everyone is trying to give more and hopefully Valencia will be a chance to show that.”The normally reliable Serbian was as hard on himself as his teammates when reflecting on Saturday’s defeat. “We did not play well, Saturday was not good and I think I played one of the worst games I’ve had since joining Manchester United,” Matic said. “If I looked in the mirror it was to tell myself I could do better.“We made mistakes, for sure the manager will be telling us about them, but I don’t believe any player goes on to the pitch not wanting to give his best. It is never easy when you lose games, especially when you are at a big club where everyone expects you to win. There is pressure on us now, but to be honest there is always pressure in football.“When you are at a club like this, every single day is a new challenge, in every game you play you have to prove all over again that you deserve to wear the shirt and you are worth your place on the pitch.”Matic did not deny that the United players had been talking about the situation – with Luke Shaw setting the tone with his admission that the ones on the pitch needed “to look at ourselves” rather than looking to the manager for guidance – but the midfielder would prefer action to words, and preferably in the next match.“I don’t think with talking you can resolve something,” Matic said. “You need your leaders on the pitch, the ones who are not scared to play. In the next games we will see who is the leader. Talk in the dressing room doesn’t mean anything. Sometimes it can help but most important is on the pitch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee39b89ac219edc437288da97cee4923a8c758cc/0_99_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e38a9ede5624d3eb30b9b7a806f9f4b","title":"pep guardiola manchester city hoffenheim champions league","story":"Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City may need to “suffer” in the Champions League group stage to comprehend how difficult progression deep into the competition is, after failing to reach the semi-finals in each of his two years as manager.Under Guardiola’s management City have been eliminated at the last-16 stage by Monaco and the quarter-finals by Liverpool. This was after qualification to the knockout phase was achieved with a game to spare each time. Having lost 2-1 at home to Lyon in the opening Group F match he understands how imperative defeating Hoffenheim at the Rhein‑Neckar-Arena on Tuesday night is.Vincent Kompany stated how claiming the European Cup represents a final frontier for the club under the Sheikh Mansour ownership as City have claimed every domestic trophy at least once. “It’s the last step we haven’t achieved yet and the club is always aiming to progress,” the captain said.“I’m not looking too big into the past. This is a good team, if we play at our level we’ll give ourselves a chance, you can’t ask for more right now.”Kompany has now been at the club for a decade and the Champions League remains the ultimate target. “I’d love to win it with City, but it’s such a tough competition to win,” said the 32-year-old. “It’s OK to say we want to win it but there’s other teams who are just as well equipped to win. We have to deal with fact we lost to Lyon – we worry about Hoffenheim and then if we get momentum, anything is possible.”Hoffenheim finished third in the Bundesliga last season though they are only 11th this season, and lost at home 2-1 to RB Leipzig on Saturday. Sergio Agüero is available despite a heel problem and, while City are at Liverpool on Sunday for a pivotal Premier League meeting, the manager will not consider this when deciding if the striker should start against Hoffenheim.Following a serious knee injury Kevin De Bruyne trained with the squad for a first time Manchester but did not fly to Germany. The Belgian is expected to be available following the international break, which commences after the weekend. Guardiola said: “Kevin is not here because he can’t be. We miss his quality of course, he’s back training – the first time with the team, we’ll see when he’s ready to join the team in the games.”Guardiola ruled out a move for Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappé, following a report that he was interested and that Raheem Sterling may be sold to help finance the deal. “That is not going to happen,” he said. “Sometimes I don’t understand where the news comes from. Manchester City aren’t going to spend the money that Mbappé deserves, or that PSG deserves.“PSG are not going to sell this kind of player to any other club in the world in the next years, I guess. That is not going to happen, Mbappé is not going to come here, we are not going to swap Raheem or another top player that we have.Kompany is out of contract next summer but was reluctant to talk about his future. “It’s not the place or the moment to discuss,” he said. “I’m a player of this wonderful club and I’ve the same duty until the last day. All the rest is speculation as we’ve such an important game tomorrow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60478bdc559fa72fe4fe0ac09636f78df9f3cdb9/3_170_3910_2345/master/3910.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5aa52b66a5176c83eda64e688ed09b3c","title":"manchester united hammered sturridges stunner and hampden rumble football weekly","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Mark Langdon to look back at the weekend’s action.

Which means that the only rational explanation for the current behaviour of the Tory party is that most of its members are out of their heads on psychotropic drugs. The Birmingham conference centre has been transformed into the country’s largest crack den, with the entire cabinet and the gobbiest MPs fighting over what’s left of their stash while competing to pass off their version of fantasy as reality.We’ve already had the prime minister proposing we rerun the Festival of Britain to celebrate surviving Brexit. A Cliff Richard austerity singalong with everyone breathing a sigh of relief that they haven’t actually died. We’ve had Boris Johnson, a man who managed to waste £40m of public money failing to build a bridge across the Thames, going full psycho with a plan to build a bridge across the Irish Sea. Not to mention Jeremy Hunt in an advanced paranoid state claiming that we were in a gulag run by the EU.This wasn’t just a one-off, first-day collective meltdown, as every subsequent speaker appears to have taken all this as a benchmark of idiocy to which they should aspire.First on the main stage on Monday was Dominic Raab. Such is the febrile atmosphere of this conference that every speech is being viewed as a potential leadership bid, so Theresa May should be grateful that the Brexit secretary went out of his way to rule himself out. Almost certainly completely unintentionally.“The EU needs to get serious and do so now,” he demanded angrily. This didn’t get quite the reaction he had hoped. The hall may have had plenty of empty seats – anyone with a vestige of self-respect has long since run for the hills – but most of those who had chosen to endure the punishment beating just looked blank. No one wanted to be the person to tell Raab it had been the Tory government that had been taking the rise for the past two years and the EU had been deadly serious all along. He then went on to say he had nothing to offer but his blind optimism. No plan, just a wing and a prayer.Chris Grayling is almost always a guaranteed source of stupidity, but even so his performance was still a collector’s item. After insisting the Heathrow decision had been a no-brainer – it had to have been, otherwise he wouldn’t have been able to make it – he declared that post-Brexit Britain would be exactly like Monarch airlines. Bankrupt with tens of thousands of people in need of repatriation. Sensing he now had the hall in the palm of his hands, he concluded by saying that his priority was to complete the improvement to slip-roads in Thurrock, presumably so that they can be used as a lorry park. Failing Grayling is an example to us all that you really can be hopeless and still end up in the cabinet.It’s customary for the prime minister to be present for the chancellor’s speech. But as Philip Hammond wasn’t even present for his own gig, May clearly didn’t feel the need. Not for the first time, the Undertaker was completely out of step with his party. While the rest of them were mainlining amphetamines or taking psychedelics, Phil had stubbornly chosen to overdose on barbiturates. Every word was forced out. A struggle against unconsciousness. And not just because he had almost nothing to say. This was Phil as Philler. His final words were that the future laid with AI. You’d have thought the Tories had learned from their experiment with the Maybot.There were equal amounts of inspired lunacy to be found on the fringes. At a lunchtime meeting of the Bruges Group, Priti Patel, Andrea Jenkyns and Owen Paterson – aka Dumb, Dumber and Dumbest: the three desperados fighting over a single brain cell – could be heard reprising their favourite stories about how everyone was trying to prevent the one true Brexit to a near hysterical audience. “We are the mainstream,” said Paterson. The day Paterson, the man who blamed badgers for not making themselves available to be culled in sufficient numbers, is mainstream is the day most people head for the exits.To round off a hallucinatory day, we were treated to Jeremy Wright, the culture minister without a trace of charisma, trying to persuade the few dozen or so people still alive in the hall that he wasn’t a hologram and that he did really exist.

And here’s a safe prediction: in the days and weeks ahead we’re going to hear more of them,” Davidson told delegates in Birmingham.She urged her colleagues to remember what she called “the principles of country, of duty, of practicality and of delivery – the belief that every prudent act is based on accommodation and accord” and support the prime minister’s “practical, pragmatic and utterly Conservative approach” to Brexit.Johnson is due to speak to a packed fringe event on Tuesday when he is expected to urge the party to focus on law and order, tax cuts and housebuilding as well as restating his opposition to the May’s Chequers plan.Johnson’s leadership manoeuvring has angered many in May’s circle who complain that the former foreign secretary is making it harder for the prime minister to conclude the Brexit negotiations. Johnson may be upstaged by the home secretary, Saijd Javid, who signalled on Monday that he would announce details of the party’s post-Brexit immigration policy in a speech timetabled for noon on Tuesday, an hour before Johnson speaks.Javid hinted of a change in policy once free movement from the European Union ends following the conclusion of the transition period in 2021. He told one fringe meeting: “We’ve been an incredibly successful nation for lots of reasons, clearly one of the reasons is our openness … we’ve got to maintain that openness just in a different way.”Last Monday, the cabinet met to sign off a new post-Brexit immigration system that would offer visas to immigrants in a tiered system based on skills and wealth, an approach that ministers are expected to unveil at the Birmingham conference.Skilled workers will more easily be able to obtain visas than the unskilled andthere will be no preferential access to the UK labour market for EU citizens, although final terms are expected to subject of Brexit negotiations.Davidson’s was the latest of a series of carefully-worded interventions on Monday from senior Tory figures underlining the practical benefits of the Chequers approach, in a deliberate contrast to what the chancellor called the “sweeping statements” of Johnson.The business secretary, Greg Clark, delivered his own conference speech from a nearby car factory to underline the importance for manufacturers of preserving frictionless trade.Downing Street hopes Conservative MPs will ultimately decide there is little alternative to throwing their weight behind May’s deal, despite the tumultuous atmosphere in Birmingham.The former education secretary Nicky Morgan suggested she could back an agreement based on Chequers. “The PM has shown such resilience plodding on with this she might well just come back with something that we can all live with,” she said.But Morgan said it was important MPs from the Conservatives’ liberal wing stood firm against Jacob Rees-Mogg and his Eurosceptic followers. “This is a battle that has been coming for the party for the last 25 years and we need to have it,” she said.Many delegates sported “chuck Chequers” badges, and Brexit rebels including Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel and David Davis told enthusiastic audiences that the prime minister’s approach must be ditched.The former environment secretary Owen Paterson repeatedly told delegates “we are the mainstream” as he slammed May’s plans.Earlier in the day, the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, sought to shore up support for Chequers among the party faithful by ramping up the rhetoric against Brussels, accusing the EU27 of showing an inflexible, “theological approach,” to negotiations.A day after the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, sought to burnish his reputation with Tory activists by warning Brussels not to “turn the EU club into a prison,” Raab accused Britain’s negotiating partners of failing to engage with the prime minister’s proposals.His tough language followedMay’s defiant statement in the wake of the unsuccessful Salzburg summit, in which she called for “respect” from her interlocutors.“Our prime minister has been constructive and respectful,” Raab said. “In return, we heard jibes from senior leaders. And we saw a starkly one-sided approach to negotiation. Where the EU’s theological approach allows no room for serious compromise. And yet we are expected to cast aside the territorial integrity of our own country. If the EU want a deal, they need to get serious.”Cabinet ministers are keen to demonstrate they are taking a tough stance, at the same time as backing the prime minister’s Chequers proposals, which critics have suggested represent a surrender to the EU27.But Raab’s remarks sparked irritation in Brussels, where an EU source said both sides had to move if the talks were to progress: “In a way the ball is just as much in the UK’s court as the EU’s. We are at a point in the negotiations when neither side can say ‘the ball is in your court’. If the UK doesn’t pick up the ball, we will.”The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is drafting a non-binding political declaration on the future relationship with the UK. A senior diplomat said “counter-proposal would be “too strong a word” to describe this document, which has been planned for a long time.Linked to that text, Barnier is drawing up “improved” proposals on the Irish backstop. The backstop is the European commission’s fallback plan to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, but May has said no British prime minister could ever accept Barnier’s version, which would keep Northern Ireland subject to many EU rules."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76dfc4b3229d3309b0226e777fafd47e37a6b549/694_407_4791_2875/master/4791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0879a6ac90db89d3c3a84b86c93a145","title":"twitter reacts to mays brexit festival plan","story":"Social media users demonstrate scale of the task ahead if the event is truly to reunite UKIt’s fair to say that Theresa May’s announcement that the government is proposing to hold a Festival of Brexit Britain in 2022 hasn’t been universally well received.At the weekend the prime minister said £120m would be spent on hosting the event, which is aimed at marking what May described as a “moment of national renewal”.She said: “Almost 70 years ago the Festival of Britain stood as a symbol of change. Britain once again stands on the cusp of a new future as an outward-facing global trading nation. And, just as millions of Britons celebrated their nation’s great achievements in 1951, we want to showcase what makes our country great today.”Social media users almost immediately leapt on the announcement, demonstrating the scale of the task ahead if the event is truly to reunite the nation.Richard Littler, whose Scarfolk website is a treasure trove of satirical fake public information posters, has created a poster for May’s event, based on the 1951 Festival of Britain original. It captured much of the spirt of the social media response.People were not short of ideas what some of the key attractions could look like:Inevitably comparisons were made with Banksy’s Dismaland theme park:Others recalled the annual news staple of Winter Wonderland attractions that turn out to be anything but wonderful:Steve Bullock, who co-hosts Brexit podcast CakeWatch, produced a long list of possible activities that could be planned for the event, including games of pin the blame on a remainer, workshops on cooking chlorinated chicken and buying unregulated medicine on eBay, and the presence of an innovative jam pagoda.And in the spirit of a more environmentally caring era, there was an excellent suggestion that the venue for the event could be recycled.Labour MP David Lammy described the entire proposal as “historically illiterate”. He said: “The Labour government’s 1951 Festival of Britain marked a new era of growth and international cooperation. The opposite of where this Tory government is taking us.”The proposed date for the festival, 2022, is also the date of the next general election due to be held under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.Some imagined that the queues were already building up in the post-apocalyptic post-Brexit Britain.And some had interesting ideas about the kind of people who might attend.The bleaker humour revolved around the fact that money had been found to hold this festival during an era of austerity-based cuts to the arts.While Mogwai guitarist, Stuart Braithwaite, has already definitively ruled out the Scottish band making an appearance.There was speculation about how the event itself might climax.And the creator behind the @Coldwar_Steve account offered their services as creative director.But given the way that he has recently been using newspaper and television interviews to put himself in the frame to replace Theresa May, there was only ever going to be one choice of an official mascot piñata for the event:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99edbcac18e459ebaf4d6484abc1b479cb553d5f/0_296_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=016eae00429bbe21bb98c7eabf8a27a1","title":"brooks koepka ryder cup spectator","story":"• Corine Remande, blinded in right eye, may take legal action • ‘Clearly there is responsibility on the part of the organiser’The spectator whom Brooks Koepka hit with a tee shot at the Ryder Cup is considering legal action against the tournament’s organisers after losing the sight in one eye.One of Koepka’s drives on the opening day of the tournament flew towards the crowd and hit Corine Remande. “Doctors told me I had lost the use of that eye,” the 49-year-old told Agence France-Presse. “It happened so fast, I didn’t feel any pain when I was hit. I didn’t feel like the ball had struck my eye and then I felt the blood start to pour. The scan on Friday confirmed a fracture of the right eye-socket and an explosion of the eyeball.”Koepka was quick to make his way over to the crowd and apologise to Remande, who was later treated at an eye hospital in Paris. “Quite clearly, there is responsibility on the part of the organisers,” she said. “Officials did not shout any warning as the player’s ball went into the crowd. More than anything I want them to take care of all the medical bills to make sure there is no risk of infection.”Remande, who had travelled from Egypt to attend the tournament, also criticised the tournament organisers for “not making contact” with her following the incident.

Still, it was impossible to ignore the proving of people wrong when Europe’s successful captain pinpointed a key reason behind Sunday’s victory in Paris. “The picks,” said Bjørn immediately on Monday morning.The selection of that quartet – Paul Casey, Sergio García, Ian Poulter and Henrik Stenson – led to allegations of an old pals’ act on the part of the captain, specifically in the case of the out-of-form García. The delivery of a combined 9½ points, the best aggregate in Ryder Cup history, meant there was more substance to the process than Bjørn had earlier been given credit for. “They delivered,” he said. “That was not down to me it was down to them. They wanted to deliver.”The Dane, now rightly heralded among Europe’s finest captains, revealed his wildcards had no cause to be surprised when their places were confirmed. “I put plans together with them,” he explained. “It was so much easier for me to put plans together with them because I know them so well. I could have conversations with them and know how they work, what they do, what makes them tick, what makes them do the right things coming into it, so we could out-lay plans for them and then go with that. That’s more to Henrik and Sergio than the other two. Paul, when he decided to come back and play in Europe, played in our EurAsia Cup team. That week I spent with him there did so much for him and for me in the way that I knew that he could fit into a team in a really good way.”Bjørn added: “I told Henrik: ‘Be prepared to play two foursomes. You might play more but be prepared to play two foursomes.’ He goes and delivers three points out of three at 42. It’s a pretty impressive thing to do when you’ve not had the greatest of seasons. With Sergio I felt if I could give him a pick, then that would boost him to go on and do things. I was pushing him. I kept pushing him to making him feel like he needed to do the work.“You’ve got to remember, he’s now the all-time leading points scorer for Europe. Even if he had not won any points here, he’s still won a lot of Ryder Cup points. That takes some doing because we’ve had some really good players that’s won a lot of Ryder Cups. It says a lot about him. I think this will kick him on to do great things next season.”There was no denying Europe’s star man. Francesco Molinari, the Open champion, showed his single-mindedness when opting to play in the PGA Tour’s John Deere Classic rather than in Europe immediately before his triumph at Carnoustie. “I was a bit like, is this the right move?” Bjørn recalled. “I spoke to him about it and he was like: ‘Well, I have to do this for how my year’s planning out,’ so I said to him: ‘I’m a little bit worried about it because I really want you to be on this team.’ I really did on this golf course because I thought it suited him perfectly. For me it would be a perfect foursomes opportunity on this golf course.“I had the conversation with him and he said: ‘For me I have to do this but I promise you I will make the team.’ I got a message on the Sunday night after the Open saying: ‘Is this good enough?’“He’s just gone on from strength to strength since. He’s such an underrated player and he has been for a long time. Now that he’s got the confidence that he has as a golfer, he can do anything. He showed that this week. He’s phenomenal. He took on the best players in the world – he is one of the best players in the world – and he showed he’s equal to the task.”There was far more to Bjørn’s expert planning. Conscious that the Ryder Cup could be decided by the final singles matches, he played video messages from Colin Montgomerie, Paul McGinley, Graeme McDowell and Martin Kaymer to his team. That quartet secured the Ryder Cup from late Sunday positions in 1997, 2002, 2010 and 2012 respectively. “Those guys told the story about what they experienced,” Bjørn added.Sports science and medical strategy was put in place to a fresh, detailed level. “If you had tried that in 2002, the nutritionist wouldn’t have got far,” said the captain with a smile.Bjørn is perfectly happy to admit a 17.5 to 10.5 thumping by Europe was beyond his wildest dreams. “If you sit and home and think that’s a score, that would be borderline arrogant against that team,” he said. “There was a time on Sunday where it looked like 14.5 to 13.5 on the prediction.“Once it kind of pans out that we have won it, it goes a bit flat for the Americans. I thought it was tight and I thought it was going to be really tight. We knew we had to be at our best to win it.”As further evidence of disharmony within the United States camp appeared, pictures emerged of a typically boisterous scene at a European victory party, where Nick Grimshaw delivered a DJ set. Earlier Bjørn’s team members had formed a WhatsApp group to exchange motivational messages an image of Justin Thomas wearing a T-shirt with ‘Beat Europe’ emblazoned across the front is known to have featured.Bjørn is not yet clear what the future holds, such was his commitment to this cause. “I’m going to enjoy the next two months,” he said. “I might have to wait until we get into 2019 to make any concrete decisions on what I’m doing next but right now I just want to go and lie on a bed for a few weeks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0add7c4a25cd7347717925452f9e1f113078c15/0_16_5057_3034/master/5057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f2aa7a19914b0432def93129e717343","title":"mercedes team orders leave a sour taste in sochi as ferrari struggle again lewis hamilton f1","story":"Lewis Hamilton’s victory in Russia was not ideal but nor was it a repeat of Austria 2002. The Scuderia have much to ponderThe spectre of Austria 2002 continues to hang over every instance of teams employing orders. When Ferrari made Rubens Barrichello move over for Michael Schumacher it was a decision of such cynical overkill it rightly remains infamous. At that point the season was only five races old, Schumacher had won four of them and had twice as many points as his nearest challenger, Juan Pablo Montoya. It was simply unnecessary. Team orders were banned afterwards but it was a rule that proved unenforceable and since 2011 they have been legal. In Russia Mercedes’ decision to make Valtteri Bottas cede his place and the win to Lewis Hamilton was not what anyone wanted to see but in what has always been a team sport it was, for them at least, necessary and understandable – incomparable to 2002. Hamilton enjoys a strong advantage but remains only a DNF from becoming vulnerable again, making every point vital.That Mercedes’ decision to enforce team orders was not pre-ordained however seems clear. The team principal, Toto Wolff, admitted he could not sleep on Saturday night, disturbed by memories of what happened in Austria 16 years ago. The team had discussed options before the race but ultimately appeared to be happy to let their drivers compete. Had they intended a switch, pitting Hamilton first for the undercut on Bottas would have been the simplest method and least damaging in terms of publicity. But they did not do so, stuck to their plan and were forced to take the hard decision when Hamilton’s blistering tyres threatened his position. Bottas admitted he had not been expecting the call and found it confusing. Mercedes should be lauded for letting them race but perhaps simply making it clear to the Finn that he would be expected to move over before the race began might have made it easier on him.Mercedes’ ruthless and clear use of orders was an object lesson to the Scuderia, who were hesitant and ambiguous in instructing Kimi Räikkönen to move over for Sebastian Vettel in Germany. As things stand, Ferrari will not be in a position to use them again. Räikkönen looks in no danger of exerting any influence on the fight at the front and even less likely to be amenable to orders now his time with the team is up at the end of this season. Worse still Ferrari, having soundly beaten their rivals in their strongholds of Canada, Britain and Spa, were badly off the pace in Russia. Having repeatedly taken a lead through upgrades across the season, their new package at Sochi was no match for Mercedes. On this form a dispirited Vettel has little hope of taking the fight to Hamilton. He and Ferrari must rue the races that slipped away since Silverstone, when they had a clear advantage.In contrast Mercedes have found just the right time to take their car to a new high. They, too, brought upgrades to Sochi, proving the development war remains in full flight, and it appears their work has really paid off. They were exposed by exit speed from slow corners at Spa but, having acknowledged the problem and looked for mechanical solutions, their exit-traction out of slower corners appeared to have improved radically in Russia. This gives them greater speed on following straights, such as the start-finish run after turn 18 at Sochi. It was here Hamilton was able to close and attack Vettel. He made it stick through turn four having gone round the outside of turn three, an indication that perhaps they have found more from their engine, to match Ferrari’s previous advantage. Mercedes are proving a finely honed, relentless force, able to draw on the experience and cohesion of the past four seasons of dominance.One positive for Ferrari from Russia was another superb performance from their new signing for 2019, Charles Leclerc. The 20-year-old was barely on the radar during the race but, in taking seventh place for Sauber, laid down another marker for what Ferrari can expect next season. What was most impressive was how Leclerc turned his weekend around. He had struggled in both the first two practice sessions, unable to find the set-up and control he needed. Yet he worked at it and by FP3 was dialled-in. He converted that to seventh in qualifying and then in the race produced a breathtaking move round the outside of turn three to overtake Kevin Magnussen and maintained his place to be first home behind the big six. He has never driven at Sochi before and his progress over the weekend demonstrated a maturity beyond his years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7316bb90c997b8fc828b344729cfa814b4b218b7/0_280_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4d0a7b20a6fada75f939bbf3777f0a6","title":"the lost ocasey review dublin theatre festival anu productions","story":"Dublin theatre festivalA forgotten play by Seán O’Casey inspires Anu Productions’ immersive journey through a dilapidated block of flatsTwo or three return visits would be required to piece together Anu Productions’ latest work, staged on the streets of Dublin and in a dilapidated complex of flats due for demolition. Each audience member is led by the cast on a separate trajectory through an intensely immersive experience. It leaves us unsure where the performance begins and ends, but with a heightened awareness of social injustice. Director Louise Lowe, designer Owen Boss, and an ensemble of nine superb actors bring us close to personal histories of the marginalised.Returning to the north inner-city setting of their acclaimed Monto Cycle, this multidisciplinary company bring their unflinching gaze to the housing and homelessness crisis. A forgotten play by Seán O’Casey, Nannie’s Night Out, is their starting point for a portrait of lives of acute deprivation in Dublin today. A work-in-progress excerpt in June took the form of a play-within-a play, performed in the backstage recesses of the Abbey theatre, where O’Casey’s drama was originally produced in 1924.In the new iteration, little is left of the specifics of Nannie’s Night Out, but its furious social commentary and themes of addiction and homelessness persist. Nannie (Sarah Morris) is a chronic alcoholic living on the streets, in and out of emergency wards with her face bruised from fights. “I’m going to leave a Nannie-shaped hole in the Liffey,” she says. Raucous, funny and defiant, she tells her story of abuse and childhood neglect to a sympathetic doctor (Leanna Cuttle) in a mobile medical clinic. From here, the action shifts to the dishevelled rooms and stairwells of the flats, whose residents have all been given eviction notices.Encompassing violence, mental illness, grief for a death that might be suicide, and a young boxing champion’s shocking fall from a roof, the narrative becomes impressionistic and fragmentary. Carl Kennedy’s sound design and Sue Mythen’s choreography powerfully evoke a hallucinatory mood, as the ensemble of five young men stagger through a haze of drugs and alcohol, blotting out the daylight in an airless room. Asked where he will move to, one of them says: “Your guess is as good as mine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/200dd7e0ba191584309448819b322284e22dfebc/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=16664c9b1504667d0b27df63c9851818 960w","title":"google launches new nest e smart thermostat install yourself","story":"Heating controller cheaper than previous model and consumers will not require a boiler engineer to install itGoogle’s latest smart-home product is a cheaper smart thermostat that anyone can install themselves without the need for a boiler engineer.The new £199 Nest E learning thermostat is a two-part system consisting of a battery-powered heating controller called the Heat Link E, which replaces an existing wired thermostat or heating controller, and a smart thermostat that can be placed somewhere else in your home.Lionel Guicherd-Callin, Nest’s head of product marketing in Europe, described the installation as being on the same level as swapping out a light switch or light bulb.The Nest Thermostat E is one of the first that can be installed by a bit of DIY, rather than calling a heating engineer. Two wires are taken out of an existing thermostat or heating controller and plugged directly into the battery-powered Heat Link E. There’s no need to actually get inside the boiler, although mains power still needs to be turned off before the wires are disconnected from the current equipment.The Nest app on a smartphone or tablet will run through step-by-step instructions on precisely how to do it, with tools included in the box.The Nest Thermostat E is then placed somewhere else in the home, normally in the room where most time is spent, plugged into a standard mains outlet and placed on a stand on a table top. The two temperature sensors, one in the Heat Link E and one in the thermostat, can then work together to ensure even heating.A US version of the Nest Thermostat E was launched in August last year, with a similar, more subtle design than the original stainless steel Nest devices. However, Guicherd-Callin says that while it resembles the US version the Thermostat E has been redeveloped for Europe to enable this DIY installation.The Thermostat E will also come with a simpler pre-programmed schedule, which has been developed using data from Nest’s existing European customers to be a best fit for most people. It will continue to learn over time, and includes Nest’s other smart features such as True Radiant that measures how long it takes for your radiators to heat up and adjust heating accordingly for a more even temperature.The Nest Thermostat E is available for pre-order in Europe for £199 and shipping by mid-October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3a38e1c0bbfd40945b4897d34f0d93965b0e90b/0_268_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7125f59f0712f8dcd8c4c6f3c281931a","title":"black earth rising recap episode four who is bobby fischer","story":"Chess references and unlikely trysts are the recurring themes this week as the Ganimana trial implodes and Hugo Blick makes an appearanceLast week’s episode appeared conclusively to wrap up the mystery of the murdered French priest who, it turns out, wasn’t dead after all. It did leave you wondering where this series would go next? This week it opens up on a new front. There’s the arrest of Patrice Ganimana, accused of helping organise the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, andan appearance from series creator Hugo Blick. He plays lawyer Blake Gaines, a man with a seething passion for legalistic amorality and defending the indefensible. As for Michael, he finds himself assailed from all sides by his conscience, his legal nemesis Gaines, the ravages of cancer and even by romantic propositions. It’s as much as his highly developed sense of irony can take.First, the French business is quickly dispatched. Brigadier General Lesage makes a full and thorough confession to the magistrate. Yes, Clement Barré’s death was covered up so as to conceal French involvement in Rwanda. Yes, the charge against Alice was concocted as a means of avenging Alice, who Jacques Barré regarded as responsible for his son’s killing. Cut to Barré’s mansion. As the police and their dogs arrive, a broken Barré – sitting in his son’s preserved room – shoots himself in the head.Kate remains perplexed at the extent of the cover-up. Michael points out to her that English, not French, is now the national language of Rwanda. This is all part of the post-colonial games, still played out by nations whose pride is still hurt.Following a triumphant speech in which Alice celebrates the exposure of her fabricated prosecution as breaking the “yoke” of the west, she presents Kate with another gift: this time, a torn of piece of fabric from the shirt she was wearing when she was found by Ed at the orphanage. The symbolism is obvious – “It’s your past. It belongs to you.” But Kate will come to wonder why Alice “keeps giving me things”. And what did Alice mean when she said: “You’re ready.” Ready for what?And now, the game’s afoot once more. Ganimana has been arrested at a London hospital, where he is being treated for cancer of the brain. He flew in on a false name but, for some reason, used his real name at hospital admissions. In Rwanda, David Runihura takes a call with a western journalist which turns from elation at Ganimana’s capture to pique as the journalist hints that Alice might return to the country a national hero, and possibly threaten the present incumbent’s authority.In another steely but playful encounter with Kate, in which he breaks into a tap-dance, full of the ironic joys of winter, Michael seems to hint that Britain’s impending departure from the EU might have impelled Ganimana to take refuge here. “In six months you’ll need a visa to pop over to (France) for a pack of fags,” he says, implying that Brexit might boost his chances of avoiding extradition. Still, reckons Michael, he’s toast. Blake Gaines, however, who has a touch of Minder’s Inspector Chisolm gone rogue about him, appears pretty nerveless when he confronts the Crown Prosecution Services officer as she presents an arrest warrant to Ganimana at the hospital. Does he know something?In another conversation over Michael’s daughter Hana’s bed, Alice tells Michael she is going to wait for the outcome of the Ganimana case before returning to Rwanda, lest she back the wrong outcome and lose the people’s trust. As the conversation warms, Michael finds himself inviting her to stay at his place she makes a joke about bodily fluids and suddenly they are in a clinch. Both step away from the moment, however.At Westminster magistrates court, Michael meets Gaines, in a testy yet strangely lawyerly exchange. They compare each other to the chess players Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer. Gaines callously advises Michael to drop the case as he knows it will fail. Michael understands why in a frantic call to the Hague. They are dropping the case – all 12 witnesses against Ganimana have pulled out, presumably intimidated into doing so. And witness protection isn’t one of The Hague’s strong points.Back at Kate’s, she lays the fabric of shirt out on her kitchen worktop it oozes blood. (Is that a hallucination?). Michael drops by they try unsuccessfully to open Eve’s suitcase, then enjoy a late-night meal of cornflakes and Bordeaux. Out of nowhere, Kate propositions Michael. This is a stunner as he points out, wasn’t she supposed to be his replacement daughter? She describes him as beautiful she hasn’t seen him pissing blood. He demurs – for now.Meanwhile, Rwanda has made its own move, demanding Ganimana’s extradition to its own domestic courts, given the failure of the Hague to prosecute. This should be good news but as becomes clear in a phone exchange between Michael and Eunice in America, this would also hamper Alice’s chances of becoming president in Rwanda, displacing Bibi Mundanzi – their own, ulterior goal. Consequently, and with heavy heart and stricken conscience, Michael refuses to help David in the extradition. An uncomprehending Kate is appalled at this she takes it as revenge for her making a pass at him. She meets with David herself.

His comments come as Democrats and Republicans clash over whether the bureau will have enough time and scope to conduct a thorough investigation before a high-stakes vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination, which Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said would happen by the week’s end.Answering questions about the FBI investigation, the president told reporters he supported a “comprehensive” investigation and had no problem if the bureau interviewed Kavanaugh and a third accuser, who was not included in the initial list of four witnesses whom agents were instructed to question. Yet he said he would allow the Republican majority in the Senate to define its remit.“My White House will do whatever the senators want,” he said. “I’m open to whatever they want. The one thing I want is speed.”He added: “I’m guided by the Senate. I want to make the Senate happy because ultimately they’re making the judgment.”On Monday, the New York Times reported that the White House had authorized the FBI to expand its investigation as long as the bureau finished its work by the end of the week. In a letter addressed to the White House and the FBI, Democrats on the Senate panel identified more than two dozen witnesses, including the third accuser, Julie Swetnick, Kavanaugh, as well as his classmates and friends in college.Trump spoke glowingly of the judge and lamented the “trauma” he said the allegations had inflicted on Kavanaugh’s wife and daughters. The president attacked two Democrats on the committee, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Cory Booker of New Jersey, and even suggested that he had seen an unidentified Democratic senator in “very, very bad” and “somewhat compromising” situations. He did not elaborate, other than to say: “I think I’ll save it for a book like everybody else.”Trump said he had “no plan B” if the nomination failed to pass the Senate but he insisted he had an “open mind” should federal investigators determine Kavanaugh lied to the committee.On Sunday, FBI agents interviewed Deborah Ramirez, one of three women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Kavanaugh has vehemently denied all allegations against him.Ramirez alleges Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party at Yale in the early 1980s. Another Yale classmate accused Kavanaugh of being untruthful in his testimony. On Sunday, Charles Ludington, who now teaches at North Carolina State University, said he was “deeply troubled by what has been a blatant mischaracterization by Brett himself of his drinking at Yale”. Ludington said he was a friend at Yale, when Kavanaugh was “a frequent drinker, and a heavy drinker”.“On many occasions I heard Brett slur his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption, not all of which was beer,” Ludington said. “When Brett got drunk, he was often belligerent and aggressive.”On Monday, answering reporters’ questions, Ludington went on to say that “Brett has not told the truth” about his past drinking habits and that the judge had “downplayed to a great degree” that he could have drunk to the point of not remembering “what went on”.“I watched him,” he added. “I was surprised at how vocal he was about the fact that he liked beer. And he’s had some difficulty as a young man with drink.”Trump continued: “I’m not a drinker. I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life. It’s one of my only good traits: I don’t drink.”Drawing laughs from the audience, he said: “Can you imagine if I had – what a mess I’d be? I’d be the world’s worst.”At the Senate judiciary committee hearing last Thursday, the first woman to accuse Kavanaugh, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, detailed the attempted rape she said happened at a house party in 1982.Ford has not been contacted by the FBI since then, according to a member of her team. On Monday morning Michael Avenatti, Swetnick’s lawyer, said his client had not been contacted either.Posting a portion of the statement in which Swetnick says Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge were present at parties in the same early 1980s years at which drunken girls were gang-raped, Avenatti said Trump was “purposely preventing the truth from being known”.“This is a threat to our very democracy,” he said.Judge, who Ford said was present during her alleged assault, denies the accusations.At the White House, Trump said he would be fine if FBI agents interviewed Kavanaugh and all of the accusers, including Swetnick.In Boston, protesters gathered ahead of a speech by Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican who demanded the FBI investigation after voting for the nomination to proceed. He is touring New England while exploring a possible run for the White House.Ed Markey, the junior Massachusetts senator, said: “Dr Ford was empowered and she was courageous. She had nothing to gain and everything to lose. She stepped forward to tell her story. Now others are stepping forward to tell their stories about Brett Kavanaugh.”Melissa Tully and Mary Power, both from Hingham, Massachusetts, were holding “#StopKavanaugh” signs. Tully said she had experienced sexual harassment in college, but “nothing compared to what Ford experienced”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8d0879a4b28e4b349b4572aee50fbbaec52761e/0_183_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ca132fd0f618a442dc9f8eac6f5d480","title":"result of macedonia referendum is another victory for russia","story":"Western leaders offered closer integration but they were outmanoeuvred by MoscowThe refusal of Macedonia’s voters to endorse a change in their country’s name seems, at first glance, to be a matter of purely local interest. But the result of Sunday’s referendum will be widely seen as a significant victory for Vladimir Putin, a setback for the EU and Nato, and another disturbing example of Russia’s ability and willingness to influence the democratic process in western countries.Increased instability and ision suit Russia’s game plan, according to western analysts. If the referendum had been successful, it would have resolved a dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia’s route to EU and Nato membership. As elsewhere in the western Balkans, notably Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro, Moscow is determined to prevent further expansion of western influence.For students of the 2016 US presidential election, Russia’s methods in Macedonia look highly familiar. Disinformation campaigns and “fake news”, cyberwarfare and hacking, phoney Facebook and Twitter accounts and secret cash payments – the modern equivalent of communist-era “red gold” – are all alleged to have been used.Russia denies interfering. But western diplomats claimed last month that 40 new posts a day were appearing on Facebook encouraging a referendum boycott. Postings asked “are you going to let Albanians change your name?” – a blatant attempt to stoke tensions with majority-Slav Macedonia’s ethnic Albanian minority.In one incident, football supporters opposed to the name change fought police in Skopje. Some later admitted they had been paid to cause trouble by shadowy figures. A photograph was circulated on social media showing the bruised face of a popular singer. It falsely claimed she had been beaten by police.Mattis’s attempt to bolster the yes vote, backed by $8m in US congressional funding, were complemented by visits by Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, and Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief. Britain’s Foreign Office reportedly provided referendum funds.All sought to assure Macedonians their future security and prosperity were best served by closer integration with the west. But they were out-thought, outspent and outmanoeuvred by Moscow.Russia’s meddling extended to northern Greece, where four diplomats were expelled in July for trying to inflame anti-Macedonian sentiment in Thessaloniki. In 2016, Moscow was accused of trying to mount a coup in Montenegro to prevent it from joining Nato.As elsewhere in Europe, Russia’s influence campaign in Macedonia exploited and complemented rightwing nationalist-populist narratives based on notions of identity, race and the perceived threat of an overbearing EU. And it remains unclear whether Moscow’s actions tipped the balance.The paradox is that, whatever their country is called, a large majority of Macedonians support EU and Nato membership, according to a recent survey. That prospect has receded, at least for now. In the continuing Europe-wide contest for power and influence, Russia just scored again."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Politicians to be targeted over departmental control and perceived humiliation of forcesEmergency meeting of top officers convened as reservists drafted to fill gaps on third shipBen Gilroy also forbidden from acting as legal adviser to othersSurvivors say they were shown file on Bill Kenneally but board failed to notify GardaDonohoe to hold meetings with FF to obtain assent for budget day packageProposed route advanced by planners includes 18km link between east and west of cityMinister expected to rule out granting military personnel the right to strikeThousands of businesses being extorted by paramilitaries, says senior PSNI officerParliamentary Budgetary Office advises broad, non-volatile tax base in budgetJunior Minister Catherine Byrne says lobbying for report ongoing for several monthsAnti-abortion deputy was member of Oireachtas committee on Eighth AmendmentPresidential candidate also defends comparing \u0026lsquoTweetgate\u0026rsquo to institutional abuseTen Protestant workmen killed in south Armagh, allegedly by Provisional IRA\u0026lsquoBabies come hot-wired to breastfeed\u0026rsquo parents hear at \u0026Aacuteras an Uachtar\u0026aacutein eventLocal authorities must once more \u0026lsquotake responsibility\u0026rsquo for building affordable homesSubmission to NTA said \u0026lsquomuch more ambitious investment\u0026rsquo requiredPostmortems held on bodies of sea anglers recovered after overturned boat spottedCentral issue in the context of a compensation claim was whether the injuries were \u0026lsquomaliciously inflicted\u0026rsquo, judge says"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648197.1538425544!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"crew shortage prevents naval service vessels setting sail","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of the Naval Service Reserve were drafted recently to supplement crew shortages on the LÉ Eithne, the navy’s flagship. Photograph: APTwo Naval Service vessels were unable to set sail last week because of a crew shortage while reservists have been brought in to plug gaps on a third ship, it has emerged.Emergency talks were held last Friday in Haulbowline between Chief of Staff, Vice-Admiral Mark Mellett, Assistant Chief of Staff Brig Gen Peter O’Halloran and the Flag Officer Commanding, Cmdr Mick Malone.Meanwhile, the issue of shortages in the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Army is expected to feature highly in the annual PDForra conference of non-commissioned officers.The LÉ Orla, a coastal patrol vessel, and the LÉ Niamh, a large offshore patrol vessel, were unable to leave their Haulbowline base, it is understood.Members of the Naval Service Reserve were drafted in recently to supplement crew shortages on a third ship, the LÉ Eithne, a helicopter patrol vessel that is the navy’s flagship.Shortages are such that Naval Service personnel are being asked to return to sea early, sacrificing part of their pre-planned shore leave. This has prompted a level of dissent from some of those asked.Retired Brig Gen Ger Aherne said the relationship between the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence is now “toxic, broken, dysfunctional and dangerous”.Key to the current problems, said the senior ex-officer, who has been critical of military pay levels , is the “long term political and institutional neglect and indifference towards the Defence Forces”.Lieut Col Earnán Naughton, general secretary of Raco, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, said the Defence Forces’ “governance and command structure is breaking down”.“Within the Air Corps, there is a 30 per cent shortfall in pilots and technicians which means the service is operating at less than 70 per cent capacity,” he said. “Army officer corps strength is about 40 per cent down.Senator Gerard Craughwell said Naval Service petty officers and senior non-commissioned officers have been asked to take up lower-ranked duties to make up crew numbers so ships can get to sea.Staffing difficulties are linked to the problem of retaining Defence Force personnel. But strained relations between senior officers and the department run deeper than just this issue.An example cited is how the department treated a joint submission to the Public Service Pay Commission which is looking at pay rates, particularly rank-and-file earnings and restoration of pay cuts.The Defence Forces were asked to tell the department what they wanted, which senior officers did in writing but then heard nothing back until after the submission was forwarded directly to the commission.Last night, the Defence Forces press office said Vice-Admiral Mellett “received briefings regarding naval operations and the challenges associated with the delivery of Maritime Security and Defence services” in Haulbowline.The departmentsaid naval reservists had been given training recently. The service has 92 per cent of its numbers, it added.Recruitment is continuing and staff will get pay rises worth between 6.2 per cent to 7.4 per cent. In addition, they will enjoy the restoration of the 5 per cent allowances cut under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648190.1538425342!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"defence forces veterans claim lack of respect being shown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRetired Sgt Maj Noel O’Callaghan and his grand-daughter Aleesha Penrose (9) at an Army protest in September: 1,760 Defence Force members are on family income supplement, a collective humiliation of military personnel and their families, says Sgt Maj Noel O’Callaghan. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsRetired Defence Force veterans are planning to mount a highly visible public campaign in which politicians will be targeted over what the retirees see as a lack of respect being shown to serving Defence Force members and their families.The perceived lack of respect manifests itself in the relationship between, on one side, the Defence Forces and, on the other, the Government and Department of Defence as well as in the Government’s approach to general pay and conditions within the Defence Forces.According to retired Regimental Sgt Maj Noel O’Callaghan, a leading member of a close-knit group steering the campaign, 1,760 Defence Force members are on family income supplement – a fact seen as a collective humiliation of military personnel and their families.The Defence Force establishment is supposed to be 9,500 personnel across the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service. However, at present it stands at some 8,800, many of whom, particularly the rank-and-file members, are struggling financially.Depletions have opened holes in all ranks, including skilled cohorts, such as pilots and aircraft technicians, and further up the command structure, as well as among mechanics and communications officers in the Naval Service, according to sources.The Department of Defence is seen by campaign members as treating the Defence Forces with a degree of contempt. Uniquely in terms of the public sector, the head of the Defence Forces, the Chief of Staff, is not his own “accounting officer” which means that, even when a budget has been agreed for the Defence Forces, he cannot spend within the agreed parameters without reference back to the department.The actual accounting officer for the Defence Forces, the person with responsibility for recruitment and retention policies, is not the Chief of Staff but the secretary general of the department.The need for departmental approval for almost everything is seen as being insisted upon to an absurd degree.As another of those supporting the campaign, retired Brig Gen Ger Aherne, puts it: “If a local community group came to me to ask could they borrow a tent for a one-day parish event and I had a spare one, I would still have to ask some junior official in the department if it was okay to lend it. Escalate that situation to a critical level of command and control and you can see there’s something wrong.”The campaign aimed at politicians will be rolled out for next May’s local government elections, and also should there be a general election in 2019.Minister of State with responsibility for Defence Paul Kehoe (constitutionally, the full minister is Taoiseach Leo Varadkar) got a foretaste of the campaign last Saturday when retired Defence Force personnel paraded outside his constituency office in Wexford.Service defence force personnel are prohibited for strike action, or anything of a similar nature, and also from political involvement. Retired members retain a reluctance to stage political displays, preferring the parade option instead.The campaign will be overseen by five retirees, including Sgt Maj O’Callaghan, and, later this month, they plan to meet and agree the message which they hope local activists in each of the general election constituencies will deliver to candidates.The campaign “will target the message to inidual candidates who are not cognisant of the needs of the Defence Forces”, says Brig Gen Aherne, adding the veterans want “the military family to vote strategically”.Attention is likely to focus on sitting TDs connected to the current Government.“We would encourage veterans to parade in front of every Fine Gael TD’s constituency office, every Independent Alliance TD and the three inidual TDs – Michael Lowry, Sean Canney and Michael Harty – supporting the Government. We are looking for respect and loyalty for the Defence Forces,” says Brig Gen Aherne.He cites several measures needed urgently to address the crisis.There should be a commission to address the relationship between the department and the Defence Forces there should be a reactivation of the Council of Defence, a formal body in which the department and senior officers are supposed to meet but which, according to Brig Gen Aherne “has not met for years because it is a statutory body and the department doesn’t want anything on the record” the implementation of the 2015 White Paper on Defence, and immediate discussions on the implementation of the European Union working time directive.Brig Gen Aherne says also that the operational implications for the Defence Forces in relation to anything that Brexit might throw up have yet to be fully considered.“When the Western Brigade, of which I was the last General Officer Commanding was collapsed – by ministerial order – responsibility for the entire Border was transferred to the brigade headquarters in Rathmines.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648202.1538426483!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"budget 2019 deals to be hammered out in coming days","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Finance  Paschal Donohoe: his meetings with his ministerial colleagues on the budget in recent weeks have been relatively straightforward.

While no agreement has been reached yet, and three meetings are provisionally scheduled for this week, sources on both sides expect a deal to be struck before the weekend.Mr Donohoe’s meetings with his ministerial colleagues on the budget in recent weeks have been relatively straightforward. The budget process has been significantly de-dramatised (to coin a phrase) in recent years, as reforms to the budget-making process introduced in the wake of the financial crisis bed into the system. We know that spending on capital (schools, hospitals, roads, equipment, etc) and current (pay, pensions, welfare) will be significantly increased, with demographic costs in health and education and the cost of future public sector pay increases already factored in.We know that there will be a package of tax reductions directed at middle-income workers who pay the top rate of income tax on relatively modest salaries. We know there will be a package of welfare increases.We know also that there will be a package of tax increases necessary to pay for other spending increases beyond the €3.5 billion budget day package that the Government settled on earlier this year.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe The Government has committed to carrying out a scoping report on urban regeneration in the Inchicore and Kilmainham areas of Dublin city, following representations from Minister of State Catherine Byrne.Ms Byrne was at the centre of a recent controversy when she indicated she might vote against Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy in a no-confidence motion, due to her opposition to a housing development in her constituency.The two had clashed over a large cost-rental housing development planned in Inchicore.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had warned Ms Byrne he would sack her from her position if she voted against the Government. Shortly before the vote she released a statement outlining that she would back Mr Murphy, following meetings with the Minister and Mr Varadkar.Speaking at a public meeting in Inchicore on the controversial housing development on Monday, Ms Byrne announced she had received a commitment for a report into the regeneration of the south central Dublin area.In 2016, Kieran Mulvey was appointed to draw up recommendations for the regeneration of the north inner city, after a series of shootings related to the Hutch-Kinahan gang feud.In a letter to Ms Byrne, Minister of State for housing and urban development Damien English said he had been tasked with “advancing a similar initiative in the Inchicore and Kilmainham area”.The letter, received on Monday, said an independent expert would be appointed to make recommendations on how to tackle social and economic problems in the area. The expert will have a four-month deadline to complete a report.Speaking to The , Ms Byrne said the process of lobbying for the report had been ongoing for several months.She said there had been no “horse trading” in a meeting she had with Mr Varadkar over the no-confidence vote against Mr Murphy.“The process has been going on for a couple of months. When push comes to shove I feel maybe there was an opportunity for them to listen to what I was saying,” she said. The recommendations of the report would likely be tied to future investment, she added.“There is no point in having it unless it’s going to produce a funding source, I think that commitment is very clear from the Taoiseach now, and Minister Murphy,” she said.Dublin City Council had also committed to hold three public meetings consulting locals over the planned cost-rental housing development, Ms Byrne said. Some 30 per cent of the 470 homes will be social housing."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648169.1538423428!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joan freeman a long ago love a loan and the lack of a helicopter","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenator Joan Freeman launching her presidential campaign to questions about Des Walsh, the LA businessman who  contributed €120,000 to her cause.    Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsIt panned out more like the final scenes of a Barbara Cartland novel than the launch of a presidential campaign. If you read the blurb it goes something like this: A generous loan from a mystery businessman reveals a chance encounter with a long lost love in the shade of a gigantic pyramid.The launch of her official campaign on Monday saw Joan Freeman being bombarded with questions about Des Walsh, the Los Angeles businessman who had contributed €120,000 to her cause by way of a loan.As she recounted at her launch, and earlier to Seán O’Rourke on RTÉ, it had little to do with boring politics, rather a grand romance.For as it happened, she went out with Des Walsh when she was 19 in 1970s Dublin.“So we broke up after less than a year. Des went his way, I went my way. Seemingly what happened was Des moved to America, moved to I think Texas, and then moved to LA.“And after 40 years, he sent me an email. We spoke on the phone.”When asked had she conducted background checks on him, or done due diligence, her response came straight out of the Mills and Boons political playbook.“The fundamental question – sorry I might seem very shallow – what does he look like 40 years later? Is he married? Does he have children? Where does he live?”Despite the persistent efforts of reporters to change the literary genre from romance to hard-boiled, Freeman was not taking the bait.“No I didn’t need to do a background check on him. This guy is a very good guy.”Walsh used to be the president of a huge dietary supplement company called Herbalife which escaped being designated a “pyramid scheme” in 2016 but only after paying a fine of $200 million.In a clear case of rose-tinted ocularitis, Freeman could see no conflict, or no wrong. Walsh had made the contribution in his personal capacity and was now retired from the company. Besides, there had been no “criminal activity” by the company.“Just the way he remembers me from 40 years ago, he believes in what I’m doing. It is a loan,” she said.Freeman has a point in saying that Ireland is becoming like Trump’s America, where only the very rich, or those backed by the resources of a party, can become a candidate for president.She pointed out she will be paying the loan back at 9 per cent interest for five years, or possibly for 10. And she is the only one of the candidates who hasn’t a campaign bus, or, indeed, a campaign helicopter.Freeman arrived to her launch wearing a dress of royal purple with flared sleeves, a colour very reminiscent of Mary McAleese during her campaign in 1997.She outlined a number of interesting initiatives including extending the president’s An Gaisce awards to all age groups, having a national day of wellbeing, clamping down on cyber bullying and valuing our ageing population.The location was the City Assembly House, an eye-catching Georgian building in the city centre. And as is the wont of presidential launches this year, the room always seem too small for the scrum of media and supporters.Freeman talked about the hidden powers and the symbolic powers of the president that can mobilise communities across the country.That said, she is by far the richest when it comes to the timbre of voice and her ability not to get riled by questions. She sounds so like her sister Theresa Lowe, the former RTÉ presenter.

Video: YoutubeConservatives\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChancellor Of The Exchequer Philip Hammond speaks during day two of the annual Conservative Party Conference on Monday in Birmingham. Photograph: Jeff J MitchellGetty ImagesA solution to providing frictionless trade across the Irish border after the UK leaves the European Union might be found using technology such as blockchain, British chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond has said.“There is technology becoming available. . . I don’t claim to be an expert on it but the most obvious technology is blockchain,” Mr Hammond said when asked about how the government could achieve smooth trade after Brexit.Blockchain is a transparent and secure database that can be shared either among a limited private group or made available more publicly.Addressing the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Mr Hammond said he backs prime minister Theresa May’s Chequers plan for a comprehensive exit deal in the Brexit talks.Mr Hammond said Europe would remain Britain’s largest trading partner and there was a need for friction-free access to the EU to continue.“That’s why I share the prime minister’s determination to get the Chequers plan agreed,” he said.Mr Hammond called on Conservatives to stand “four-square” behind Ms May as she enters the final weeks of negotiations ahead of a hoped-for deal in November.In a scathing attack on Boris Johnson, he dismissed the former foreign secretary’s Brexit proposals as “fantasy world” and said he does not believe he will ever be prime minister.He told Sky News: “Of course, Boris is a big personality, nobody is denying that. What I’m saying is that the business of government is a process of attention to detail, follow-through, lots of hard work. “It isn’t just about making flamboyant statements and big announcements, it’s about getting things done.”Mr Hammond also said rebalancing trade with the EU was a delicate process which should be done gradually, and that product standards should stay the same after Brexit.“We have to be very, very careful and we need a very, very gradual process of rebalancing our trade between Europe and the rest of the world.“Pulling the rug away from a very large part of our export business in the hope that we can then build up new business to replace it would be highly dangerous.” Mr Hammond said goods regulation in the EU had been stable for the last two decades therefore was relatively easy for British firms to stick with. However, he was “much, much more sceptical” about adopting EU standards on financial services. “This is a fast-developing area that could move in a direction that was very difficult for us,” he said.His comments come as British Brexit minister Dominic Raab Ms May’s government will not accept two different customs regimes in the United Kingdom after Brexit so the European Union needs to show less dry legalism in talks on Northern Ireland.“What we’re not going to do is see the United Kingdom carved up into two separate customs regimes . . . that is just not on the table. Frankly, I think it’s outrageous even to contemplate it,” Mr Raab told Sky News on Monday.“We need to see a bit less dry legalism and dry dogmatism and a bit more of the flexibility that we have demonstrated in our white paper,” Mr Raab said.Ms May’s ministers came out one by one at their party’s annual conference to warn the EU that they will embrace leaving without a deal if the bloc fails to show “respect” in the talks to end Britain’s membership.Mr Raab warned the European Union against trying to bully the United Kingdom into signing a deal that would undermine the unity of the country.“If the only offer from the EU threatens the integrity of our Union then we will be left with no choice but to leave with no deal,” Mr Raab told the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham.“What is unthinkable is that this government, or any British government, could be bullied by the threat of some kind of economic embargo, into signing a one-sided deal against our country’s interests,” Mr Raab said.“I find it hard to believe that they would, for narrow political ends, seek to punish Britain in such a crass and counterproductive way,” he said.Mr Raab called on European Union leaders to start to compromise in talks over Britain’s exit from the EU, as time runs out for a deal to be done.“If the EU want a deal, they need to get serious. And they need to do it now,” Mr Raab told the Conservative party conference in Birmingham on Monday.He said the EU’s approach to talks so far had seen “a starkly one-sided approach to negotiation” which had left “no room for serious compromise”.Meanwhile British foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has come under fire for comparing the European Union to the Soviet Union during his speech at the conference ” and describing the EU as a prison.He said he had voted to remain in the EU, but now supported leave because of what he called the EU’s “arrogance” during Brexit negotiations.He said the EU seemed to want to “punish” a member for leaving, and likened their tactics to the Soviet Union.“The lesson from history is clear: if you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won’t diminish, it will grow - and we won’t be the only prisoner that will want to escape.His comments did little to soothe relations, provoking those eastern members of the bloc which only regained full independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.They joined the EU more than a decade later. Lithuania’s EU commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis told Mr Hunt he was born in a Soviet gulag forced labour camp and was jailed by the Soviet KGB state security agency. “Happy to brief you on the main differences between EU and Soviet Union,” he said. “Anytime. Whatever helps.”Peter Ricketts, who ran the UK foreign office between 2006-10 and is a former ambassador to France, tweeted: “This rubbish is unworthy of a British foreign secretary. The EU isn’t a Soviet-style prison. Its legal order has brought peace and prosperity after a century of war. Our decision to leave was always going to leave us worse off. The only punishment is the self-inflicted variety.”–Reporting from Reuters, PA and  News and Media 2018Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Eliot BlondetReutersThe French far right has expressed outrage at a photograph showing President Emmanuel Macron with his arm around a shirtless West Indian youth while the young man “gives the finger” to the camera. Mr Macron and his entourage minimised what they called “a silly gesture”.Mr Macron spent four hours with the inhabitants of Quartier d’Orléans, one of the poorest towns on the island of Saint Martin, on Saturday. Drenched in a tropical rainstorm, he invited himself into the apartment of the shirtless young man whose jeans are slung so low that most of his underwear is showing. As someone snapped a photograph of a smiling Mr Macron wedged between the young man and another youth, one of the two raised his middle finger.In other photographs the same young man is seen smiling and laughing with the French president. The offending photograph was seized upon by Marine Le Pen, leader of the far right Rassemblement National (RN), who tweeted it with the message, “One cannot find words to express our indignation. France certainly doesn’t deserve this. It’s unforgiveable!” Four other far right officials also expressed their disgust at the photograph.Mr Macron reacted the following day, saying, “The reason that I fought to be elected against Marine Le Pen and the reason why I’m here today is that I love every child of the Republic, whatever silly things they do, because often they haven’t chosen where they were born... We have to stop thinking that our young are no good, because they’re a certain colour or because at some point they do silly things... Marine Le Pen is the extreme right, and the extreme right are not the people.”A few minutes after the photograph was taken, Mr Macron scolded the other young man, who wears a white shirt and gold chain. He had just come out of prison. What was he in for, the president asks in the video broadcast by France Télévision. \u0026nbsp“A little armed robbery,” the youth replies. “You mustn’t do any more stupid things,” Macron lectures in a grandfatherly tone. “The robberies are finished. You told me so. Don’t forget. Your mother deserves better than that,” the French president adds, whereupon he bear-hugs the young man’s mother.A year ago, in the wake of Hurricane Irma, which devastated the Caribbean, Mr Macron promised €500 million for reconstruction. He was scandalised to see how little had been done, and blamed local government, saying, “There has been too much conniving and colluding, sometimes even corruption. It has to end.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648095.1538433368!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain open to alternative ways of delivering brexit says raab","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK Brexit secretary Dominic Raab: “The EU’s theological approach allows no room for serious compromise.” Photographer: Chris RatcliffeBloombergBritain is willing to listen to “alternative ways” of delivering Brexit as negotiations with the European Union move into their final phase, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has told the Conservative Party conference. But he warned that the UK would leave with no deal rather than accept an arrangement that compromised the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom or tried to keep the UK inside the EU by the back door.“As in any negotiation, we will listen to alternative ways of delivering on the strategic criteria we have set out, because a good deal would be the best outcome for everyone. “But our willingness to compromise is not without limits. We are leaving the European Union in fact, not just in name,” he said.Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond told a fringe meeting at the conference last night that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it could be obliged to impose checks on the Border.“The challenges around the Irish Border are around the legal requirements we will have if we are not in a trade bloc within the European Union to operate the WTO-compliant border, which does require checks at the Border,” he said. “That’s what the WTO rules require. We are depending on the WTO to regulate our relations with the rest of the world, we will have to comply with the rest of WTO regulations or we will find we can’t enforce our WTO rights against others,” he said.Earlier, Mr Hammond told delegates in Birmingham that, regardless of their views on Brexit, some geographical and economic facts were unavoidable.“Europe remains, by far, our biggest market. And after 45 years of membership, Britain’s economy has shaped itself around that fact. “Complex supply chains cross and re-cross our borders. More than 11,000 trucks pass each day through the port of Dover and the Channel Tunnel alone, carrying tens of thousands of tons of food, components and finished products in both directions with no more delay or bureaucracy than they would crossing the border from England into Wales, ” the chancellor said. “And our businesses, and the workers whose jobs depend on them, need that friction-free access to continue,” he said.Mr Hammond predicted that, if the prime minister returned from Brussels with a Brexit deal, the British economy would receive a boost he described as a “deal idend”.Britain is expected to present its proposal for the Border backstop next week but EU negotiators are pessimistic about its capacity to break the deadlock. The proposal is expected to accept the need for Northern Ireland to remain aligned with the EU for the regulation of goods but would offer the Stormont Assembly, which is currently suspended, a role in authorising such alignment.\u0026nbspCrucially, it is expected to maintain Britain’s opposition to any customs arrangement for Northern Ireland that is distinct from the rest of the UK. Labour’s shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, said the prime minister had no credible plan for addressing the issue of the backstop. “Labour has long argued that a customs union, with a strong single market relationship, is essential to avoid the return of a hard Border in Northern Ireland. “That is why it is disappointing the Tories have repeatedly blocked a customs union.” she said. “If Theresa May is to have any chance of getting a Brexit deal through parliament, she needs to accept the need for a customs union after Brexit – and fast,” Ms Chapman added.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Win McNameePoolReuters I never thought it could be as brutal.The same Republican gargoyles who once tore Anita Hill limb from limb knew they had to tread gingerly, with women at the barricades. They outsourced the estrogen to “a female assistant,” as Mitch McConnell called Maricopa County sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell.And race, which scorched the Hill-Thomas hearings, was not a part of this excruciating face-off. Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh were summoning memories of summer days in the very white, very cosseted country club, prep school world of suburban Washington.But, shockingly, it was more brutal.Not only because the sexual transgression Blasey Ford was describing was more savage. But also because Kavanaugh simply adapted Clarence Thomas’s playbook of raging against the machine. Thomas’s fury was white-hot. Kavanaugh’s weepy. But the pitch was the same.“This is a circus,’’ Thomas seethed in 1991.“This is a circus,’’ Kavanaugh seethed on Thursday.Kavanaugh echoed Thomas’s martyrdom, claiming he was being “destroyed” by partisans conspiring to dig up dirt. He charged that Democrats were conducting a “grotesque and co-ordinated character assassination” because of their anger about President Donald Trump’s ascent and their desire for revenge after his own seamy work helping Ken Starr in his pervy pursuit of Bill Clinton.It was a cri de coeur custom-made for the age of Trump – and custom-designed to please Trump himself: entitled white men acting like the new minority, howling about things that are being taken away from them, aggrieved at anything that diminishes them or saps their power.As the Atlantic noted, Kavanaugh brandished Yale as “a magic wand, something that could be waved to dispel questions of his conduct”.Thomas prevailed over Hill because of that lava flow of anger. The senators were frozen, Pompeii-style, as he cried racism to snatch the mantle of victim.Hill’s aloof, dispassionate description of Thomas’s harassment, and her preternaturally cool reaction to all the lurid slanders hurled at her, left the senators skeptical that she was telling the truth shouldn’t a wronged woman show more emotion?Six years later, when Hill wrote a book, the law professor explained that, as the youngest of 13 from a rural Oklahoma family, she had had years of practice in “being impervious to and immobile in the face of hurt”.Hill’s mother was left to express the emotion that her daughter reined in when the Senate confirmed Thomas to the Supreme Court, the mother snapped, “The dirty rascals.”Hill seemed so poised and polished at 35, you had to remind yourself that she was a less-assured 25-year-old personal assistant when Thomas spewed his talk about bestiality and porn stars’ anatomies. But there was no need to remind people on Thursday that the dignified professional woman at the witness table was describing something from 36 years ago.The Palo Alto psychology professor laced her testimony with scientific terms like “sequelae,” “norepinephrine” and “hippocampus”. But it was easy to visualize the 15 year old in the 51-year-old with the girlish voice and guileless air as she repeatedly pushed a blond strand of hair out of her face, smiled nervously and tried oh so hard to please everyone. Her emotions, including panic, seemed close to the surface.The pentimento of the teenage Blasey Ford made her seem achingly vulnerable. Like Hill, she had a purity to her manner and story that was luminous, an impressive contrast to all the dark obfuscations, self-serving political manoeuvring and petty deceptions around her.Kavanaugh had seemed to dissemble a few times in his earlier testimony, including about his role in the case of the stolen Democratic documents in the Bush years and his role in the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping programme.And he appeared to do so again on Thursday, pretending the “Renate alumnius” in the Georgetown Prep yearbook was an affectionate term for his “great friend” who called the innuendo “horrible, hurtful and simply untrue”. He said the vomiting that gained him entry to the “Beach Week Ralph Club” was about spicy food more than drinking. Right. Again treating the senators like idiots, he provided innocent meanings for clearly salacious terms used like “Devil’s Triangle”.The nominee whom Ted Cruz defended as “a boring boy scout” became a sneering portrait of privilege denied.When Amy Klobuchar, citing her father’s alcoholism, asked if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he snapped back, “I don’t know – have you?’’Jeff Flake was so unnerved by the blast of opposition to his decision to vote for Kavanaugh that he led a scheme to get a week’s delay to have the FBI investigate.So we will finally drag Mark Judge, the man named by Blasey Ford as the third person in the room that night, out of his beachfront hideout. If the Republicans wanted to discern the character of who they’re putting on the court, rather than simply solidifying the conservative majority, they would already have subpoenaed Judge and anyone else who could provide clarity.The hope that the FBI will save the day may be misplaced. In the case of Anita Hill, agents were deployed by Republicans to help smear her.Even if Kavanaugh is confirmed, he already seems warped by this experience – just like Thomas was, when he went on to the bench as a very angry and bitter man.But at least we have a few more days to pretend to look for the truth."},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London.

You haven’t,” she told the Observer earlier this year.The Rt Revd Jackie Searle, Bishop of Crediton, paid tribute to Dr Sentamu, who presided over her consecration just last week.“There will be a great deal of thought, prayer and wide consultation before the next Archbishop of York is appointed... and no doubt a great deal of speculation,” she said.“The joy is that for the first time in Church history both women and men will be able to be considered for the role – alleluia!”Dr John Sentamu cut up his dog collar as a protest against the Zimbabwean regime of Robert Mugabe in 2007Rev Dr Elizabeth Macfarlane, chaplain at St John\u0027s College Oxford and a campaigner for women\u0027s rights in the Church of England, also welcomed the fact that women were now eligible for the post.“There are senior women who are well able to be really considerable candidates for that role, and I would hope that they would be taken seriously,” she said.Emma Percy, chair of campaign group Women and the Church, said it was unlikely that a woman would be appointed.Female bishops are relatively new, she said. The expectation is that it is normally someone who has been a diocesan bishop of a while. That said, it is a possibility – never say never.In a statement, Dr Sentamu said he had decided to announce his retirement now to allow the widest possible timeframe to find a successor.I am full of joy and expectation to see all that God is doing and will be doing in this diocese and in the Northern Province over the coming months,” he said.The Archbishop, who fled his native Uganda in the 1970s before studying at Cambridge University, has been an outspoken and prominent public figure.In 2007, he cut up his clerical collar live on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show in a protest about Robert Mugabe’s brutal regime. He vowed not to replace it until the Zimbabwean president was gone and just last year, he replaced it on the show, days after Mugabe was forced out.The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, said Dr Sentamu\u0027s service was something to rejoice in with great gratitude.A Church of England spokesman said it was anticipated that the position would be filled in time for the Lambeth Conference in October 2020.Church of EnglandIndonesia hit by fresh quakes off island of Sumba as hunt for last week\u0026#39s victims continuesIndonesia tsunami: Mass jail breaks as president calls for international aidItalian lecturer suspended by CERN for \u0026#39physics invented by men\u0026#39 speech Stranded humpback whale rescued in ArgentinaDonald Trump says he is happy for all three Kavanaugh accusers to be interviewed by FBIChildren who attend nursery are better behaved than those who stay at home with parents, study findsThere are far too many blue plaques... it\u0026#39s nonsense, says plaque chiefWe would work with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, says DUP leader, as she praises his \u0026#39positive\u0026#39 Brexit visionArlene Foster prepared to compromise on Troubles amnesty for veterans, sources claimCancer patients to be promised diagnosis within three weeksBlack Earth Rising, episode 4 review: yet more twists and turns as Hugo Blick himself makes an appearanceDrowning in Plastic, review: a valuable, harrowing survey on the problem with plasticComment: The Conservatives must become the party of business and free markets againBoris Johnson will warn Tories not to copy Corbyn by hiking taxesTen to the dozen: teach children to count in 12s, campaigners sayComment: A second referendum would be the most negative and pointless political battle of our lifetimeBritain sending experts to Indonesia in aftermath of devastating earthquake Mark Lamarr has assault and false imprisonment charges dropped Why astronauts might not have the stomach for a mission to MarsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/01/TELEMMGLPICT000176515859_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6844extr6dIv-d8O8PIpPqbshHooRpJk-anXnRBzWKY.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"far many blue plaques nonsense says plaque chief","story":"A blue plaque from where Frederic Chopin went to the Guildhall to give his last public performanceIf you have noticed blue plaques springing up all over town, you are not alone. The chairman of an organisation that puts up the plaques has agreed there are far too many of them.Mike Read, the former Radio 1 DJ and head of the British Plaque Trust, said some are erected at spots that have only a fleeting connection to the famous person in question.“There are too many. There are about 50 for Dickens,” said Read, who was speaking at the Henley Literature Festival. “And Tolkien has quite a few. I’m a bit against that. There’s one to Tolkien where he stayed for two nights. That’s nonsense.“In Basingstoke about eight years ago, they suddenly decided, ‘We don’t have any plaques’, so they said, ‘Let’s bang some up.’ One or two are appropriate, the others maybe not that appropriate.“You can’t put one up saying, ‘This is a very old building.’ We have lots of very old buildings. That’s not terribly good.”The subjects of Basingstoke’s plaques range from Jane Austen, who attended dances in the town, to the local marketplace, where a plaque notes that markets have been held on that spot since 1214.One plaque marks the spot where the Beatles once had fish and chips in NorwichOfficial blue plaques are given out by English Heritage, which administers a scheme that began in the 1860s, and they currently number just over 900. However, councils and other organisations are free to put up their own.The British Plaque Trust is a separate body that recognises the contributions of “notable, influential and successful people from all walks of life” around the UK – the English Heritage scheme is limited to London – and its patrons are Earl Spencer and Lord Grade.Read says he can sometimes be overruled by his own committee. “One I didn’t agree with was Screaming Lord Sutch. OK, he was a character. But I didn’t think he was worthy of a blue plaque.”English Heritage requires recipients to have been dead for at least 20 years “to ensure that the decision about whether or not to shortlist a

considers sunday hunting ban teenager mistaken wild boar","story":"Nathan Labolani was walking his dog in the woods near Apricale, 10 miles north of Ventimiglia, on Sunday morning when he was shotItaly’s environment minister has called for a nationwide ban on Sunday hunting after an 18-year-old was fatally shot because he was mistaken for a wild boar.Nathan Labolani was walking his dog in the woods near Apricale, 10 miles north of Ventimiglia, close to the French border, on Sunday morning when he was shot in the abdomen with a 300 Winchester magnum rifle.  The incident sparked a political furore and a fierce reaction from anti-hunting activists, who say that anyone who strolls through the woods is now “gambling with death”. Sergio Costa, the environment minister, appealed to regional governments to immediately ban the hunting of wild boar on Sundays, while pledging to evaluate the need for a national law to “allow greater security and better management of hunting”. “What happened yesterday is a huge tragedy that has struck us all deeply,” Mr Costa wrote on his Facebook page. He said that on Sundays forests and mountains were full of hikers who went in search of mushrooms or chestnuts and they had the right to “simply enjoy nature without running the risk of dying”.Boar populations have risen rapidly in Italy, partly as a result of farmland being abandoned and recolonised by scrub and woodland, prompting a heated debate about how manage their numbers. Authorities estimate there are at least a million wild pigs roaming the countryside and on the periphery of major cities including Rome, up from 600,000 a decade ago.As prosecutors in the town of Imperia opened an investigation into the death, allegedly caused by an unnamed 29-year-old hunter from Ventimiglia, questions were being raised about a 12-gauge shotgun that was found near the victim\u0027s body and whether he was also a hunter.Politicians were ided about the call to restrict hunting, but the Associazione Vittime della Caccia, the hunting victims’ association, condemned Labolani’s killing, saying that anyone who strolled through the woods was now “gambling with death”.“Not only is the one who shot him responsible, but also those who authorise this kind of hunting in public places,” said Maurizio Giulianelli, association vice-president.  The organisation accused government institutions of “hypocrisy and indifference”, saying 217 people had been killed and another 900 injured by hunters in the past 10 years. Of this number it said 31 people were killed during last year’s 2017-2018 season while 17 people were injured in September this year.  “It is unacceptable that we continue to justify the killing and wounding of defenceless people, referring to them only as a ‘tragic fatality’,” Mr Giulianelli said on the association’s website.Former tourism minister, Michela Brambilla, now president of the animal rights group Movimento Animalista, said this was the “umpteenth tragedy” and there was “no place” for hunting on Sundays.“We are asking immediately for more restrictive laws and tighter controls,” Ms Brambilla wrote on the organisation’s Facebook page.Animal rights group LAV said no innocent person deserved to be killed by hunters and blamed Labolani’s death on a decision to bring the hunting season forward by two weeks in the north-east region of Liguria.But Sergio Berlato, a regional councilor from Veneto the region surrounding Venice, accused animal rights groups of exploiting the accident.“It should be considered for what it is – a tragic accident – and not the demonstration of the need to ban hunting for motives of public order or national security,” he said.Giuseppe Pan, Veneto’s hunting councillor, called for greater education and preparation for hunters. There are more than 40,000 hunters in the Veneto region alone and the regional government has set aside €350,000 (£310,000) in 2018 for education and security

executive Giles Hurley added that Aldi\u0027s increased fresh food range would make this more difficult.“While I think storage of additional stock is worth considering, based on storage and shelf life that would be very challenging,” he said.I\u0027m not worried we\u0027re stockpiling Brexit food – if anything, I\u0027m gladBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab said in July that the government is making plans to secure food supply in the event of a no-deal Brexit.But he said it was “wrong to describe it as the Government doing the stockpiling”, indicating that industry would need to take the lead.Speaking as Aldi unveiled its annual results, Mr Hurley said the grocer does not yet have a “detailed” Brexit plan due to lack of clarity on the deal.Cadbury stockpiling chocolate to prepare for

down fears that a shortage of EU workers could hit UK businesses.“We\u0027re very confident because we have market-leading pay rates that if there were any problems we\u0027d be fairly insulated from that,” he said.Aldi on Monday confirmed growth plans for the UK, targeting 1,000 stores by 2022.Mr Hurley said new stores could include sites left empty by collapsed retailers such as Toys R Us and

When private equity firm Investindustrial bought a 37.5 per cent stake in 2012, Aston Martin was valued about £400m.Car manufacturers are expected to be among the hardest hit by Brexit, because they rely on hundreds of parts sourced from across the Continent. Industry figures have warned that any delays at the border or other additional administrative burdens could prove disastrous.But chief executive Andy Palmer said last month that Aston is “well insulated” from problems that could result from the UK crashing out of the EU without a trade deal.“We can demonstrate that Brexit is not a major effect for us,” he said.“If there is a tariff into Europe, it’s countered by a tariff into the UK for our competitors so you might lose a little bit of market share in the EU but you pick it up in the UK.”Aston Martin sells roughly 25 per cent of its cars to the EU and operates its only plant in Britain, with a second one due to begin operations in 2019.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Not small firms…But in the past in my two previous restaurants, when I’d posted about any social impact activities I’ve undertaken – be it hiring ex-offenders or going to west Africa to help girls in a slum dwelling set up their own businesses – I’ve been questioned about my motives in publicising what I’ve done. To some, the post becomes a boast.I’ve carried on regardless, not least because over time I’ve found our customers actually like the fact that we do stuff with the money they spend with us other than just line our pockets. I wish more people would do the same.A new report by campaigning group peak b based on a survey of over a thousand small businesses found that over a third of small businesses said they are not primarily driven by profit, while 90 per cent felt they have a role to play in supporting community organisations.Over three-quarters support local organisations – including charities, schools and foodbanks – despite the everyday challenges that founders face running their own enterprises.\u0026nbspMany of Britain’s small businesses – with or without the ‘purpose with profit’ label – are already purpose driven entities.Day in, day out, small businesses are embedded in communities and neighbourhoods. They are not just a selling device to earn a livelihood for their owners and employees but an empowering vehicle for those who haven’t been so lucky. And they often do this against a backdrop of a struggling economy with increasing costs, rates, rents and competition from larger scale companies.Jenny Costa found herself appalled that food retailers would throw out fruits and vegetables that didn’t look right rather than present them to their customers so she set up Rubies in the Rubble – a business making sauces and chutney from ingredients otherwise destined for the bin.There are even impact investors now – people who will only use their money to back projects that aim from the outset to help solve a social or environmental problem.One of these investment groups,\u0026nbspMustard Seed, backed Jenny and their fund is seeing huge financial as well as social returns.Proportion of small firms who feel they have a role to play in supporting community organisationsAnd that’s the key pivotal point of change we are witnessing in business. Before we would talk of giving something back or of helping others and frankly it wasn’t good enough.Large firms and their CSR pledges rarely amount to more than spending a day in the year painting the proverbial church wall – old style noblesse oblige made contemporary with the aid of a podcast.I’ve watched many social enterprises set out with great missions yet have terrible financial performance. Their losses are often written off by the massive funds that have emerged in the last decade to back projects aimed at tackling problems that charities or governments have failed to.They are now being superseded by the “purpose with profit” business.What the peak b report teaches us, though, is that many of Britain’s small businesses – with or without the label – are already purpose driven entities.As one of its contributors says, we’re often too British to tell others about the impacts we are making as many feel this is a private matter.But when we also read that people do so despite facing financial troubles of their own, we need to spread the message not just that doing good is good for business, but that telling people we are doing good is good for business.Iqbal Wahhab OBE is the founder of London restaurants The Cinnamon Club and Roast and author of Charity Sucks, published by BitebackShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

A third and final series was commissioned in August this year. Sir Stelios, who now runs easyGroup, which includes brands such as easyHotel, easyGym and easyPizza, said: “I think this is a case of typically arrogant behaviour by a very large American tech company who never bothered to check what legal rights other companies have outside the US. When Joe Swanberg came up with the name ‘Easy’ for his new TV series a couple of years ago they should have checked with their European lawyers before using it. The man who invented easyJet but couldn’t sell easyPizzaFastjet threatens to sue over Stelios ‘insolvency’ letterSir Stelios will never give his old\u0026nbspcompanies an EasyRide“We own the European trademark for\u0026nbspthe word ‘easy’ and another one thousand trademarks with easy as a prefix and we can’t allow people to use it now as a brand name, especially when they are doing it mostly\u0026nbspwith our colours and font. At least I am pleased that Netflix have said that they will stop at series three anyway. However we have to stop them from promoting the older series in Europe for online streaming.” A Netflix spokesperson: “We’re looking into it but think viewers can tell the difference between a show they watch and a plane they fly.”Guy Wilmot, a partner at law firm Russell-Cooke, said that for easyGroup to succeed, it would have to establish that using the word “easy” in connection with the Netflix show would lead to a likelihood of confusion with the company’s registered trademarks, or that it would take unfair advantage of the firm’s reputation and brands. EasyGroup could also argue that Netflix is passing off its goodwill in the word “easy”. “EasyGroup does have a significant number of registrations in Europe for trademarks which include the word ‘easy’ and they clearly have a significant reputation for certain services, especially air travel services,” said Mr Wilmot. However, he added that this “does not necessarily mean that it will succeed”. “A trademark registration applies to specified goods and services and goodwill attaches to an existing reputation. If easyGroup’s marks are not registered for TV or entertainment-related services then it might struggle to establish infringement or passing off,” he said.“Even if easyGroup has one or more trade mark registrations which cover entertainment, broadcasting or television services (which given the number of marks it has registered is possible) it can still lose the protection of the trademarks. “There is a ‘use it or lose it’ rule under which easyGroup will lose the coverage of the marks in certain services if the trademark has not been used for those services within the last five years (if the mark is more than five years old).”Mr Wilmot added that easyGroup might need to argue that Netflix is taking “unfair advantage” of its trademarks or passing-off, but said both these claims could be difficult to establish given that easyGroup’s goodwill and reputation is in other areas. “In either case, easyGroup would have to show that there is some connection made between consumers of the Netflix show and easyGroup’s brands,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

When Joe Swanberg came up with the name ‘Easy’ for his new TV series a couple of years ago they should have checked with their European lawyers before using it. The man who invented easyJet but couldn’t sell easyPizzaFastjet threatens to sue over Stelios ‘insolvency’ letterSir Stelios will never give his old\u0026nbspcompanies an EasyRide“We own the European trademark for\u0026nbspthe word ‘easy’ and another one thousand trademarks with easy as a prefix and we can’t allow people to use it now as a brand name, especially when they are doing it mostly\u0026nbspwith our colours and font. At least I am pleased that Netflix have said that they will stop at series three anyway. However we have to stop them from promoting the older series in Europe for online streaming.” A Netflix spokesperson: “We’re looking into it but think viewers can tell the difference between a show they watch and a plane they fly.”Guy Wilmot, a partner at law firm Russell-Cooke, said that for easyGroup to succeed, it would have to establish that using the word “easy” in connection with the Netflix show would lead to a likelihood of confusion with the company’s registered trademarks, or that it would take unfair advantage of the firm’s reputation and brands. EasyGroup could also argue that Netflix is passing off its goodwill in the word “easy”. “EasyGroup does have a significant number of registrations in Europe for trademarks which include the word ‘easy’ and they clearly have a significant reputation for certain services, especially air travel services,” said Mr Wilmot. However, he added that this “does not necessarily mean that it will succeed”. “A trademark registration applies to specified goods and services and goodwill attaches to an existing reputation. If easyGroup’s marks are not registered for TV or entertainment-related services then it might struggle to establish infringement or passing off,” he said.“Even if easyGroup has one or more trade mark registrations which cover entertainment, broadcasting or television services (which given the number of marks it has registered is possible) it can still lose the protection of the trademarks. “There is a ‘use it or lose it’ rule under which easyGroup will lose the coverage of the marks in certain services if the trademark has not been used for those services within the last five years (if the mark is more than five years old).”Mr Wilmot added that easyGroup might need to argue that Netflix is taking “unfair advantage” of its trademarks or passing-off, but said both these claims could be difficult to establish given that easyGroup’s goodwill and reputation is in other areas. “In either case, easyGroup would have to show that there is some connection made between consumers of the Netflix show and easyGroup’s brands,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

So it\u0027s possible that you might spot part of the Orionids\u0026nbspany time from now until 7 November.Rare electric blue clouds captured on film by NasaAnd while 21 October marks the peak of the show, the Moon might mean you\u0027re more likely to see them the week before. Around the middle of the month, it will get out of the way in the sky and make it easier for the Orionids\u0026nbspto shine through.At their peak, the Orionids could see as many as 20 of the meteors streaking across the sky. That makes it a relatively muted meteor shower compared with some of the other annual displays, but it still should be visible for the ground.And what they might lack in quantity they can make up for in quantity: the Orionids are known in particular for the brilliance of some of their lights, making them especially easy to spot.As ever, astronomers recommend heading out to somewhere with relatively little light pollution so that the night sky is more visible. Find somewhere dark and allow your eyes to adjust before looking up into the sky – wherever you\u0027d like, and with no special equipment needed at all.In keeping with their name, the meteor shower\u0026nbspwill be most visible from famous constellation of\u0026nbspOrion. But in practise, you can look just about wherever you want – and some experts recommend looking up with friends, so that you can survey the entire sky at once.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Someone should have told them beforehand.”The EU leader’s comments come after a UK government report published in September warned flights could be disrupted in the case of a no-deal, since\u0026nbspEU-issued aviation licences would not be valid.Airlines would have to seek inidual permissions from the bloc’s 27 states to operate in those states.Ministers had previously\u0026nbspexpressed\u0026nbspdoubt on\u0026nbspthe prospect of planes being grounded if there is a no-deal Brexit, with transport secretary Chris Grayling saying in September last year:\u0026nbsp“Flights will carry on. Does anybody seriously think the Spanish government, which would see hotel bookings collapse in 2019, is going to intervene to stop planes flying? Of course, they’re not.”At the meeting in Germany, Mr Juncker\u0026nbspsaid: “What I really regret in the context of Brexit is that there was no real Brexit campaign in terms of actual information in the United Kingdom.“The people are finding out now – including British ministers and ministers on the continent – how many questions it poses, all the things we need to resolve.”He continued: “I ask myself what is going to happen to the 250,000 dogs and cats who leave the European continent each year.“Right now they just pass through the customs, all these dogs and cats coming to mainland Europe each year.“There are lots of people in Europe who just want people and animals to just cross borders, but I think we are going to have a four-day quarantine.“If you want to go to Brittany for eight days for holidays, then maybe you need to leave the dog or cat at home, or maybe you will stay home altogether.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson speaking at the Conservative Party annual conference at the International Convention Centre in BirminghamProtestors set off on an anti-Brexit march, organised by the \u0027Best For Britain\u0027 campaign group, in central Birmingham Royal Navy Commander, Nathan Gray lands his F-35B onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time.Headteachers from across England and Wales hold signs in Parliament Square, London, as they prepare to march on Downing Street to demand extra money for schoolsFormer leader of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson (C) arrives at the Old Bailey Courthouse in London, Britain, 27 September 2018.

London building’s history, rooted in the poverty of the Victorian era, is repeating itselfClick to followThe IndependentThe early residents of Toynbee Hall, with Rev Samuel Barnett sitting to the right of his wife HenriettaIt stands where gastropubs now jostle beside the old East End of Petticoat Lane market, where streets are overshadowed by the gleaming towers of the modern City of London.\u0026nbspAmid such bustle, it is easy to overlook the lower rise, altogether more modest Toynbee Hall, and still easier to miss its significance.\u0026nbspYet this is the place that provided formative experiences for two key architects of the welfare state, William Beveridge and Clement Attlee. \u0026nbspThis is the place that can claim a pivotal role in the creation of social justice initiatives such as\u0026nbspthe Child Poverty Action Group.\u0026nbspIt is where the Poor Man’s Lawyer scheme started in 1898, and where free legal advice is still offered today – along with debt counselling, investigation of social problems and many other community services.More than a century after Toynbee Hall opened in 1884, it remains a place of pilgrimage for researchers and innovators the world over, seeking out the institution where so much began, and where so much is still being done.\u0026nbspAnd now, after a £17m restoration and redevelopment, chief executive Jim Minton is determined the reopening of the Grade II listed building should be marked by an exhibition showcasing Toynbee Hall’s history as a “powerhouse for social change”\u0026nbspand suggesting what it could do in the future.“So much did happen here and so much has been inspired by here,” he says.\u0026nbsp“This is a great moment to open the place back up again, to show the community what they have achieved and to say, ‘Let’s achieve even more in the future’.\u0026nbspBecause the problems have not gone away”20th century (Toynbee Hall Archives)There is, of course, a certain irony in that last point.Toynbee Hall was created to help lift the East End out of poverty but continues to confront\u0026nbspthe same issues of low incomes, high debt and poor housing that affected the area in 1884 – with contemporary twists.Since the\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspvote,\u0026nbspsays Minton, “our free legal advice service has started dealing with questions from people from other parts of Europe who have heard something, or been told something by their employer.”While in the 1880s the head of Toynbee Hall described casual labour – the system that saw men massing outside dockyard gates hoping to be picked for a day’s work – as “the hardest problem of east London”, there seems something of a modern echo when\u0026nbspMinton notes: “Over the past 10\u0026nbspyears, we have seen a significant change towards in-work poverty, among people in insecure employment, or on zero-hours contracts.”And yet, when Toynbee Hall opened in the 1880s, it did so during a decade that was supposed to herald a new and better beginning.\u0026nbsp“It was the end of an epoch,” recalled Winston Churchill.\u0026nbsp“The great victories had been won.\u0026nbspSlaves were free.\u0026nbspConscience was free.\u0026nbspTrade was free.\u0026nbspBut hunger and squalor were also free and the people demanded something more than liberty.”Minton\u0026nbspsees parallels today with 1818: low income, high debt, and poor housing\u0026nbsp(Toynbee Hall)In 1883, Reverend Andrew Mearns\u0026nbspwould shock middle-class Victorians with\u0026nbspThe Bitter Cry of Outcast London, his pamphlet exposing the horrors within the “rotting and reeking tenement houses” of London’s “great dark region of poverty, misery and immorality”.In 1888,\u0026nbspJack the Ripper would add fresh horror with his Whitechapel murders, virtually\u0026nbspon Toynbee Hall’s doorstep.\u0026nbspAnd in the\u0026nbspparish of St Jude’s – occupied despite the\u0026nbspbishop’s warning that it was “perhaps the worst district in London” – Reverend Samuel Barnett and his wife Henrietta were\u0026nbspwell-placed to separate grim reality from lurid sensationalism.The reality was plenty bad enough.\u0026nbspIt featured whole families living in a single room, whole neighbourhoods sharing a single lavatory, with sewers running down the middle of streets.\u0026nbspAnd yet the casual labourer was often paying more in rent per cubic foot than the rich of South Kensington.\u0026nbspThe precariousness of his income meant landlords felt justified in charging higher rents to cover themselves against inability to pay or moonlight flits – an early example, perhaps, of what is now known as the “poverty premium”.In 1883 Rev\u0026nbspBarnett was able to return to his old university to speak at the Oxford Union, and to win by unanimous vote the motion that “the condition of the poor in our large towns is a national disgrace”.\u0026nbspAnd he found a receptive audience when, in November 1883, he came “as a prophet”\u0026nbspto talk to a small group of graduates at St John’s College, Oxford, urging them, as one listener recalled, to “share the life of that dim and strange other world of east London”.For the Barnetts, this “university settlement”, proposed eight months after Karl Marx’s death, would help show the people demanding something more than liberty that they did not need to go as far as revolution.“The poor,” Rev Barnett\u0026nbspwrote in 1895, “think progress is to be won by revolution.”\u0026nbsp But\u0026nbsphe believed\u0026nbspprojects such as\u0026nbspToynbee Hall could help preach “the good news of a unity greater than rich or poor … Humanity will help the poor see the rich as their brothers, and God as their father.”Gustave ​Doré’s\u0026nbspimage of the slums of Victorian London may have been sensationalised for a middle-class audience but the reality was\u0026nbspbad enough (Alamy)Rev Barnett and the\u0026nbspforceful, equally accomplished Henrietta\u0026nbsphoped the young Oxford men would do in the city something akin to what the gentry was supposed to do in the countryside: befriending the poor and showing them how to lead better, fuller lives.\u0026nbspThe Barnetts’ vision, however, also contained large doses of humility.Before devising any bright ideas of their own, the Oxford men were supposed to learn from the poor among whom they were going to live.\u0026nbsp“The needs of east London are often urged,” Rev Barnett told them, “but they are little understood.\u0026nbspHe who has, even for a month, shared the life of the poor can never rest again in his old thoughts.”And so began the building, in the heart of the East End, of something resembling an Oxbridge college.\u0026nbspNamed Toynbee Hall, after the Barnetts’ recently deceased kindred spirit Arnold Toynbee, the Oxford historian credited with coining the term “the Industrial Revolution”,\u0026nbspit opened its doors for the first time in 1884.\u0026nbspRev Barnett was the first warden.\u0026nbspThe volunteer residents\u0026nbspdined in a hall adorned with the crests of their old Oxbridge colleges.\u0026nbspThey were soon offering help, solidarity and a rather mind-boggling array of activities to the East End.In one of the most definitive accounts of the early years of Toynbee Hall, Professor Emily Abel described how East End errand boy Ernest Baker found himself assisting in the running of the Toynbee Hall Elizabethan Literary Society.The Natural History Society broadened East Enders’ horizons by taking them into the countryside, and under the tutelage of some of the more vigorous volunteer residents, the Toynbee Travellers’ Club introduced the London poor to the joys of mountain climbing in the Swiss Alps.As Prof Abel noted, Toynbee Hall’s early residents did not always avoid being clumsily patronising –\u0026nbspone suggested the Shakespeare Club could counteract east Londoners’ “inability to amuse themselves rationally”.Created with

is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalAmong those present was a shabbily dressed character who said his name was Richter.\u0026nbspIn broken English, he berated Morley for supporting the imperialist foreign policy of Britain and other “capitalist nations”.“Go down to Limehouse or Shadwell and see how the people live,” said Richter.\u0026nbsp“Their slums, impoverishment, degradation and prostitution!\u0026nbsp That’s where your foreign policy should lie.\u0026nbspThey are the victims of your capitalist organisation which is just as powerful and cruel as the force of arms.”Morley and others politely begged to differ –\u0026nbspso politely that Richter was invited back to Toynbee Hall for tea a few days later.William Bowman, a Toynbee Hall resident who was present at the tea, recalled how Richter, “who seemed hungry”, tucked into the cakes and was particularly fascinated by the buttered muffins, which he had never tried before.But he wouldn’t budge from his belief in violent revolution.“History has shown,” he told the Toynbee Hall residents between mouthfuls of cake and muffins, “that no great change has been brought about without the shedding of blood and revolution.”Eventually he declared: “I have enjoyed this talk, but now my time is up.\u0026nbspI must go to visit my friends in Limehouse.”Richter\u0026nbspshook hands with the assembled company and departed.\u0026nbspOnly much later did the Toynbee Hall residents realise that they had in fact been having tea with the exiled Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin.In a gentler way, some of the stances taken by Toynbee Hall and its residents have been, if not revolutionary, then at least profoundly challenging to conventional wisdom.\u0026nbspEven as the hall opened, the Barnetts were\u0026nbspin the process of parting ways with the Charity Organisation Society (COS), which had started in 1869 as the Society for Organising Charitable Relief and Repressing Mendicity.Much emphasis was placed on repressing mendicity\u0026nbsp– begging.\u0026nbspRather as some now rail against a perceived “benefits culture”, the social reformer Octavia Hill, a driving force in the COS, firmly believed that indiscriminate alms-giving “degraded” the poor, making them happy to rely on charity and unable or unwilling to support themselves through hard work.In a possible echo of the current debates around fit-to-work benefits tests, it was believed that extensive scrutiny of applications for “relief” was needed to distinguish the virtuous but luckless worker from the “clever pauper”.“The main tone of action,” maintained Hill, “must be severe.\u0026nbspThere is much of rebuke and repression needed, although a deep and silent undercurrent of pity may flow beneath.”In the eyes of the Fabian Beatrice Webb, the Barnetts “discovered that there was a deeper evil than unrestrained charity, namely unrestricted and unregulated capitalism and landlordism.”And so in 1888 the matchgirls of the East End found allies in Toynbee Hall when they went on strike, protesting against pitiful wages and factory conditions that included white phosphorous fumes destroying jawbones, giving\u0026nbspmatch-makers “phossy-jaw”.In an early example of Toynbee Hall residents learning from their East End neighbours, a group of them made their own investigations, then helped shape public opinion with letters to The Times detailing the matchgirls’ “deplorable conditions” and below-subsistence wages.\u0026nbspAfter its first warden Samuel Barnett died in 1913, it could be said that Toynbee Hall rose to other challenges.\u0026nbspOn Sunday 4 October\u0026nbsp1936 Oswald Mosley tried to march his uniformed blackshirts through the East End.\u0026nbspJewish groups, trade unionists and leftwingers mobilised to block the fascists’ path with barricades and cries of “They shall not pass!”When the police tried to clear a route for the British Union of Fascists, the “Battle of Cable Street” began.\u0026nbspThe fascists did not pass.\u0026nbspDefeated by the dogged East Enders, police commissioner Sir Philip Game was forced to tell Mosley to march west, out of the area.A week later, however, in what became known as the Mile End Pogrom, about 200 fascists smashed up Jewish shops and houses in the Mile End Road, even throwing a young child and elderly Jewish man through a window.Toynbee Hall warden Jimmy Mallon was appalled.\u0026nbspHe called a meeting at Toynbee Hall that led to the creation of a Council of Citizens of East London, which then issued a notice to be displayed in shops and workplaces.\u0026nbsp“Citizens of East London,” the notice warned.\u0026nbsp “Forces are at work to destroy the common sense and toleration and good humour on which we pride ourselves.\u0026nbspWe must work against these forces.\u0026nbspBoycott provocative demonstrations.\u0026nbspMaintain calm and good temper.\u0026nbspStand together for fair play.”Meanwhile, Jimmy Mallon joined a delegation that persuaded the government of the need for what became the Public Order Act 1936.It banned the wearing of uniforms for political purposes, as well as enhancing police powers to deal with marches.Profumo found redemption at Toynbee Hall, rising from dishwasher to chairman (Toynbee Hall Archives)Such achievements are, perhaps, one answer to the sour aside of East Ender and future Labour leader George Lansbury, who in 1928 wrote that Toynbee Hall was used as a stepping stone by ambitious young careerists who would eventually claim that: “The interests of the poor were best served by leaving east London to stew in its own juice while they became members of parliament, cabinet ministers, civil servants.”Had he lived long enough, Lansbury might have added that Toynbee Hall was also used by at least one ex-cabinet minister to forge a new, post-scandal career.It is often recalled that in 1963, after being caught lying to parliament about his affair with Christine Keeler, John Profumo began a new career washing dishes at Toynbee Hall, rising to become chairman in 1982 and “learning humility” in the process.\u0026nbspBut it is often forgotten how much Profumo achieved at Toynbee Hall.\u0026nbspHe raised funds, helped ease overcrowding through involvement in the Toynbee Housing Association, and backed potentially controversial schemes like the “Grendon outpost”, providing aftercare for former psychiatric-prison inmates.In what could have been another riposte to George Lansbury, William Beveridge freely acknowledged that his coming to Toynbee Hall, aged 24, in 1903 had been the stepping stone to other things.\u0026nbspBut in the same breath, he said that none of his later achievements would have been possible without the “special knowledge … gained in Whitechapel”.During his two years at Toynbee Hall, Beveridge was able, he later recalled, “to learn about the main economic problem of those days, not from books, but by interviewing unemployed applicants for relief”.And Beveridge’s recommendations were implemented by the post-war government of fellow Toynbee alumnus Clement Attlee, who spent a year as the hall’s secretary in 1910.\u0026nbspAttlee came to Toynbee Hall with prior experience of the East End, having been the manager of Stepney Boys’ Club and an assistant to Beatrice Webb.In his 1920 book Social Worker, the Oxford-educated former public schoolboy revealed some of the lessons the East End had taught him.I met a small boy in the street one day.Attlee (first left) at Toynbee Hall in 1910 (Courtesy of Anne, Countess Attlee)Echoing the Barnetts’\u0026nbspgrowing distaste for the COS, while seemingly anticipating some of the thinking behind – and modern arguments about – the welfare state, Attlee inveighed against\u0026nbsp“the suggestion that those in need of relief should be passed through a sort of sieve”“They will spend much time finding ways in which small wages may be made to go a long way, without considering whether those wages should not be raised, or recognising that the claim to a share in the better things of life which is expressed in the purchase of luxuries is a more hopeful thing than submission to low wages.”In the newly restored Toynbee Hall, Jim Minton expresses pride in the connection to men like Attlee and Beveridge. But he is careful to temper such pride with a recognition of the work still to be done.\u0026nbspDespite 134 years of “progress”, despite the wealth represented by those gleaming City of London towers, the East End – still – contains two of the three worst-rated UK parliamentary constituencies for child poverty.\u0026nbspAnd in 2015, the last time such official statistics were compiled, the east London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Newham were ranked the worst local authority areas in the country for income-deprivation among older people.Child food poverty ‘sparks return of Victorian scourges’Nearly half of all children in London and Birmingham ‘live in poverty’Government must tackle ‘slum’ conditions faced by private rentersMy forefather’s life in Manchester’s slumsTower Hamlets, Toynbee Hall’s local borough, has about 2,000 homeless families in temporary accommodation and in 2015 just over a quarter of its population was found to be living in income deprivation.“We are talking every day to people who have financial problems,” says\u0026nbspMinton.\u0026nbsp“There are still huge amounts of poverty in east London.“The learning process that Attlee and Beveridge and hundreds of other less famous people would have gone through at Toynbee Hall,” says Minton, “would have been about challenging, and saying: ‘This is unacceptable.\u0026nbspWhy is this happening, and what can we do about it?’”“That,” he declares, “is very much the spirit we want to keep alive.”\u0026nbsp‘Toynbee Hall: A Powerhouse for Social Change’ is open Monday-Friday and on the third weekend of every month at Toynbee Hall, 28 Commercial Street, London, E1 6LSBattle of Cable StreetShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

In the white paper that came out of Chequers there are a lot of small areas where you can tweak things to get a compromise.“But we have to get the word ‘Chequers’ out of the conversation.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

public to decide what they want us to do next\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsHeidi Allen has become the latest Conservative MP to back a Final Say Brexit referendum, arguing there is now “no alternative”.The prominent backbencher said that, with the Chequers proposals “dead” and the threat to jobs from crashing out of the EU without a deal, the decision had to be thrown back to the public.Ms Allen blamed Boris Johnson and other Tory right-wingers for killing off Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which now had no chance of approval at Westminster – even if it can be revived in Brussels.Clark insists ‘we need to have a Brexit deal’, contradicting May“They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands,” she said. “It is they who have made Chequers dead.”She then added: “That being the case, then I think that it is the end of the road, which is very disappointing and for me leaves us with no alternative.“Should we come to that and no deal ... then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next.”Crucially, Ms Allen said the option of staying in the EU under existing terms would have to be on the ballot paper.She told BBC Radio 4 that she would still support in principle an “11th hour” deal hammered out by the prime minister but that it was now clear many in her party would not.Her comments came as the Conservative faithful gather in Birmingham for the party’s annual conference and after Mr Johnson’s latest broadside against the prime minister’s negotiating stance.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s

Rhino are systematically targeted by poachers for their\u0026nbsphorns. Fewer than 29,000 remain, and between 2008 and 2017, more than 7,000 were killed by poachers in\u0026nbspSouth Africa alone. And, as our Born Free \u0026lsquoElephants in Crisis\u0026rsquo campaign earlier this year highlighted, an\u0026nbspaverage of 55 African elephants are killed by poachers every day for their tusks. That\u0026rsquos about one every 25\u0026nbspminutes.\u0026ldquoDespite the fact that men and women around the world are putting their lives on the line to tackle the dreadful\u0026nbspcrimes of illegal wildlife trade and poaching, it just isn\u0026rsquot possible to deter and protect, all day, all night and every\u0026nbspday. \u0026nbsp                HEARTBREAKING video shows baby elephant WITHOUT his trunk55 elephants a day slaughtered for the ivory in Africa (Image: Born Free)\u0026ldquoTo cover these vast and challenging areas, to then fight through thick vegetation in time to reach poachers, or\u0026nbspto prevent their presence in the first place, has seemed almost impossible. Deploying the Dragon will transform\u0026nbspour capability and help turn the current balance on its head. \u0026nbspThis will allow our rangers to protect extensive\u0026nbspareas safely, economically and efficiently, with much-enhanced surveillance capacity and flexibility, when\u0026nbspcompared to other aircraft.The charity will launch the first Dragons at the Shamwari Private Game Reserve in South Africa, which is home\u0026nbspto two of its big cat sanctuaries as well as providing a haven for wildlife across a 100 square miles of rough\u0026nbspcountry, which is patrolled by some of the most advanced anti-poaching units.

Heres the lowdown...As of 12.30pm on March 29 2017, the UK was set on a course to leave the EU by March 29, 2019.The PM sent an official letter invoking Article 50  which was delivered to Donald Tusk.It came after May quashed a Tory revolt after passing a law to authorise Brexit following a marathon five-week battle with Parliament.The Lords had earlier defied the PM by adding two changes to the bill which would guarantee the rights of EU citizens and ensure Parliament has a vote on the final deal - but the Commons threw out these conditions.But it backed down after the Commons vote, agreeing not to tamper with the landmark power - ordered by the Supreme Court - for a second time, ending the constitutional stand-off.On October 1 Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said a pause on leaving the bloc was not on the cards and called on EU chiefs to get real.The Lisbon Treaty came into force on December 1, 2009, as the culmination of the EUs eight-year quest to make the organisation more democratic, more transparent and more efficient.It set out a number of rules and posts including the introduction of the EU Presidency, redistribution of voting weights of member states and Article 50.Article 50 sets out the process of leaving the EU and states: Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.It then goes on to say that a state wishing to withdraw will let the European Council know it intends to leave, which will trigger the article.At this point, the Treaties that bound Britain to EU rules cease to apply and the terms of leaving will begin to be negotiated.The law is not totally clear on this, but there are a few issues that could leave some wiggle room.One primarily being  a transitional deal is not secured with the EU to temporarily cover the countrys EU trade relations while the final deal is being negotiated.If the EU is unwilling to give the UK this deal, it would be an advantage for May to withdraw her request and then trigger it again - buying another two years of negotiations.Justice Secretary Liz Truss has said of Article 50 that it is her understanding that it is irrevocable.The UK Supreme Court has said once notice, Article 50, is given it cannot be withdrawn.However, Lord Kerr, author of Article 50, has said: You can change your mind while the process is going on.And the House of Lords, advised by its legal counsel, was told there is nothing in Article 50 to prevent a member state from reversing its decision.Former Labour cabinet minister Peter Mandelson has said the deadline will been to be extended.I think everyone knows none of this process is going to be completed by next March, everyone knows it’s going to have to be extended, Lord Mandelson told the BBCs Politics Live.Landmark EU orce talks are now underway, with long-term agreements over issues such as the Irish border still some way off.Former Brexit secretary David Davis and the EUs chief negotiator Michel Barnier kicked off the Brexit negotiations on Monday, June 19 2017 with a historic handshake in Brussels.On December 15, 2017, the EU agreed to move to the second phase of negotiations after reaching preliminary agreements on three of its major priorities the orce bill, the Irish border and the rights of EU citizens post-Brexit.An agreement on a transition period, or implementation period, was later reached. Theresa May and her Cabinet pushed for the arrangement to avoid a so-called clf edge moment on March 29, 2019.However, the agreement of the transition period has not been without dficulties.Fishermen and some MPs were left angry after it was confirmed that the current rules and regulations regarding EU nations access to British fishing waters would remain largely unchanged.After triggering Article 50 it is supposed to take two years to completely leave the EU but many experts think it could take far more time.Invoking the article fires the starting gun on leaving but there will then follow series of complicated negotiations.The terms of exit have to be agreed between the UK and the 27 other member states who all have a veto over the conditions of leaving.After that, it will then have to be approved in each of the national parliaments meaning French, Irish or Dutch MPs could, in theory, scupper the process.David Davis announced that Britain will officially leave the EU at 11pm GMT on March 29, 2019 - this date is now exactly six months away.The Article 50 bill passed through the final House of Commons hurdle in January, when a majority of 372 MPs out of 494 voted in favour.More than 50 Labour MPs voted against the legislation, and just one Conservative - Ken Clarke.This shows the full list of who voted for and against.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Then, on August 2018 his Somerset home was vandalised. Heres his story.Jacob Rees-Mogg is a backbench Tory MP for North East Somerset but is better known for his period drama persona which has been winning him fans.He entered parliament during the 2010 General Election after working as a fund manager in London.During the EU referendum, he was a passionate Brexiteer and made many high-profile media appearances arguing for a vote to leave the EU.To say he was born into a privileged position is an understatement - he is the Eton and Oxford-educated son of the long-serving Times editor William Rees-Mogg.During the 1997 General Election Rees-Mogg attracted ridicule.This is because he brought his faithful nanny along with him as he battled to be elected in the working class and staunchly Labour seat of Central Fe.He has batted away speculation that he would challenge Theresa May for the leadership of the party, insisting he was completely loyal to her.Rees-Mogg said he was more likely to become POPE than PM.On October 1 he also said changing Conservative leader could cause more problems than it solves and the party should back May.He said the Torys lack of a parliamentary majority meant it would be dficult for an alternative leader to push through an ambitious Brexit deal.Outside the political arena, Jacob is a family man with six children.His we is journalist Helena de Chair, daughter of the aristocrat Somerset de Chair.He celebrated the birth of his sixth child with a touching picture on Instagram in September 2017.He wrote: Helena and I announce with great joy that we have a baby Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher, a brother for Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm and Alfred.In May 2018 it was reported by The Mail on Sunday that he had purchased a new £5million house just around the corner from No 10 Downing Street.The five-storey mansion is just a short walk away from the Parliament and is also close to Tory HQ in the heart of Old Westminster.Rees-Mogg joked he had been priced out of swanky Mayfair and needed a bigger home for his six children.Rees-Mogg named his sixth child Sixtus, which is a Roman name meaning polished.It is also the name of a Pope and Saint.His full name is Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher .Sixtus eldest sibling is Peter Theodore Alphege, who was born in 2007.Jacobs only daughter Mary Anne Charlotte Emma came along a year later followed by Thomas Wentworth Somerset Dunstan in 2010 and Anselm Charles Fitzwilliam in 2012.His fth child, Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius, was featured in a video as his father tried to teach him how to say Brexit.Alfred was born in February 2016.In September 2018, a thug shouted at the children your daddys a horrible person outside their London home.It happened on August 1, 2018, when the Rees-Mogg family were on holiday in the US.According to the police, graffiti was sprayed on a building and on a car as well as the garden.They managed to write posh scum on windows of the house.The MPs 17th Century country home, called Gournay Court, is a listed building.He also owns a £5.6m house in Westminster.Due to his strict Catholic beliefs, Mogg admitted on ITVs Good Morning Britain that he did not support abortion even in the case of rape and incest.I am completely opposed to abortion, le begins at conception, he said.Abortion is morally indefensible.The MP has also repeatedly voted against sex marriage legislation.He defended everyones right to free speech, and insisted that  he ever became Prime Minister, the law is not going to change.Soon after Rees-Mogg made his remarks it emerged the millionaire MP was making money out of an abortion pill despite his strong stance against it.Somerset Capital Management, the investment company he co-founded, owns nearly £5million of shares in Indonesian firm Kalbe Farma.Reacting to the story, Rees-Mogg told The Mirror: This is not something I would wish to invest in personally but you have a duty as an investment manager not to impose constraints on investors.He added: This company does not procure the abortion of babies.It’s not my money in these investments and I profit from the total amount of client money we hold, not the investments we make.The Made in Chelsea star and 2017 Im A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here winner has admitted she has the hots for Rees-Mogg.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Georgia Toff Toffolo revealed the politicians she admired “the standard - Zac Goldsmith, Jacob Rees-Mogg. I fancy them all, adding: Jacob’s a sex god.”The reality star elaborated: “The human mind can be sexy. He’s so clever, I just love him, adding: “I fancy middle-aged politicians, but I’ve never been with one.”Rees-Mogg has responded to news of the 23-year-olds crush, saying he was “greatly surprised but nonetheless flattered” by the revelation.“I am glad Miss Toffolo won and hope this is the launchpad for a glittering career,” he added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson will draw a big crowd for his “Chuck Chequers” rally.But there is a bigger danger waiting in the wings for the Tories: They simply don’t have a domestic agenda big enough for the moment.Labour has, over the past few days, set out its vision for Britain. It is, in places, scary. But give Jeremy Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell this, it is undoubtedly clear and bold. As one Cabinet minister says, half admiringly:  “They’re hungry.”The Tories need to show  they have a better plan, one that will deal with people’s concerns— and they don’t have any time to waste. As one minister warns: “I’m just really terried. People don’t realise what a big deal this is.”The Tory Party’s problem is that it isn’t giving the country a vision of where it wants to take it. One former party leader has taken to lamenting that the Tories have “lost the narrative”.At conference last year, Theresa May declared that it was her mission to solve the housing crisis, to restore the British dream of home ownership for the many.But in the past 12 months, the Government has made far too little progress on this. Yes, some sensible steps have been taken. But the policies that will really solve this crisis, proper planning reform and a massive, Government-led housebuilding programme, haven’t happened.The result of all this: Jeremy Corbyn gets closer to power. As this newspaper revealed yesterday, Labour is now ahead in the seats that decide general elections thanks to its massive lead among renters.The likelihood of someone in their late twenties or early thirties on an average salary owning their own home has halved in the past 20 years.This is an electoral time bomb for the Tories. They can’t expect those without capital, or any prospect of getting it, to be capitalists.By the time of the next election, the Tories need to show people that their lives are getting better AND explain the damage  Corbyn would do to the country.One minister points the finger of blame at Number 10 for the Tory predicament. “A fish rots from the head down,” he tells me. But the Cabinet can’t escape its share of the blame, either.With a few exceptions, min­isters aren’t doing enough to take on Labour’s arguments. As one former Secretary of State fumed to me during Labour conference: “It’s outrageous. Where are the Cabinet?”If the Tories get Brexit wrong, it could cost them the next election. But even  they get a decent deal, it won’t guarantee them victory. For the public will vote on domestic issues — whether the housing crisis is solved, the state of the health service and what is going on with schools.Corbyn has simple answers to all these questions: They might be wrong, but they are answers. The Tories now need to show the country  they have answers too.AT last, some positivity and optimism about this country’s post-Brexit future from the Government.I can reveal  it is planning a major new festival celebrating the UK for 2022. The aim is for this festival to tell the world a story about Britain as we leave the EU and take charge of our own future. It is meant to coincide with the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee and the Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Birmingham that year.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright,  who is pushing this idea in Whitehall, has told colleagues  it will be: “Future-facing, telling a story about the UK’s unique strengths, particularly as a place to invest, as we forge a new future outside the European Union.”If the Government gets it right, this festival could be a great statement about the open, dynamic country that Britain is going to be after Brexit. It should emphasise how this country is going out into the world after leaving the EU, not pulling up the drawbridge.The aim should be to put on something that stands comparison with the great post-war Festival of Britain in 1951 or even the Great Exhibition of 1851, which showcased Victorian Britain’s global reach and technological edge.One Secretary of State, who is backing the idea, tells me: “People just want something really positive.”But cynics might note that there is an advantage for the Tories in a feel-good festival in an election year.But I understand he will  have a harsh message for the Westminster politicians in attendance. He will  tell them to stop bickering and positioning and get on with delivering for the country.Mr Street will say that outside the Westminster bubble, the public just want politicians to get on with things, rather than constantly jostling for position.What makes his  speech so interesting is that he is a Downing Street favourite. Indeed, I understand  some of those close to Theresa May are pushing for a similar tone in her speech.They believe  her post-Salzburg speech went down so well with the public not just because she was standing up to the EU but because she was taking charge and being that “bloody dficult woman”. They think she should use her speech to tell members  they won’t get everything  they want from the Brexit talks, but that she will get the best deal for Britain.Others, though, are wary of this approach. One Cabinet minister cautions that after last year, May should play it safe as “you can’t have two bad years  in a row”.THE Government has rightly guaranteed that the three million EU citizens living in Britain will be able to stay in the event of no deal.This is sensible. These citizens contribute a lot to this country, and help keep our economy and our public services moving.But it is also right that the Government is now discussing what the rules will be for deporting EU citizens who commit crimes after Brexit in a no-deal scenario.The details have not yet been decided and, as one government source puts it: “No one wants people deported for getting a parking ticket.”But it is right that those who are convicted of a signicant offence are removed.• SPOT the leadership bid will be one of the games  the Tories play in Birmingham.Any Cabinet minister who starts talking about their childhood will be accused of planning a run for the top job.  This leaves ministers walking a tightrope as they prepare their speeches. Some are dealing with this challenge by handing their time  to others.Penny Mordaunt, the Aid Secretary, is simply introducing a series of “British heroes” who do development work.But one of those involved in conference planning suspects that even this is about leadership as Mordaunt “doesn’t want to spend 45 minutes defending the aid budget to a hall of Tory activists”.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And what is amazing to me is how often people try to wriggle out of things and deny a decision they made, in a bid to stay in the process. So when they sit in the boardroom saying, “I didn’t . . . ” we can say, “Oh yes you did . . . ”Some people ask me  certain scenes are staged, but the show is unique in that there are no retakes, there is no setting up of scenes and no trying to find the comedy moment — they just come naturally.All of Alan’s jokes come naturally, too. There is no script, no autocue, it happens as it happens.Luckily, we get on very well — Claude, Alan and I. So much so that we all went on holiday together this year.We’re all quite similar, we have all been married for a long time and we all share the same family values.It makes us a watertight team, although we each bring something dferent to the table.But, parking that for a moment, The Apprentice is also top-notch entertainment — this series more than ever. What’s great about the first episode is that the contestants, all of whom talk the talk about how fantastic they are, are thrown into the deep end with a task that’s designed to test their logic.They are sent on what is a bit like a treasure hunt, in Malta, armed only with a map and some euros.This task is all about logistics, negotiation and identying, and let’s say it doesn’t end well.It turns out that, unfortunately, logic is not something all the contestants are in possession of.During this series we will travel all over the country, including to Glasgow to sell emerging artists’ work to the unsuspecting public.When I say that task was more challenging than ever, I’m referring partly to the challenge of actually getting to Glasgow because it was during the storms. Remember them?Turbulence was an under-statement. On the flight there, I was gritting my teeth and grabbing on to Claude like there was no tomorrow.One thing I love about the show is that there are equal numbers of men and women, and they are on a level playing field.Let’s face it, the same cannot be said out there in the “real” world.One thing I’ve been reflecting on over the course of my time on The Apprentice is how much things have changed for women in business since I started out.When I was having my kids 22 years ago, the very notion of “work-le balance” didn’t exist. But I’m pleased to say that working women aren’t trying to Have It All any more, and the days are gone when women feel the need to keep quiet about having kids at work.Women are now more able to demand flexible working and feel entitled to have time off for, say, ante-natal classes.More “mumpreneurs” are starting their own businesses. Still, you rarely catch working mothers using childcare as a reason for being absent from work — while men, I’ve noticed, almost get points for doing so.And it is still the case that working mothers and women working flexibly are less likely to be promoted.So I don’t quite agree with Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory MP, who wrote this week that women today have “never had it so good” yet still “whinge” about inequality.Because while it might be true that things have changed for the better, most CEOs are still male.Women might never have had it so good but it’s still not good enough — and it’s not “whingeing” to point that out.HONESTLY, watching Jeremy Corbyn forgetting Labour’s six tests for a Brexit deal, when interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, was like watching a hapless buffoon.No wonder he got two Es at A-level.This is the leader of the party that makes it up as it goes along – buying votes, promising everyone everything . . . and delivering absoutely nothing.As Margaret Thatcher said, The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people’s money.HERE, The Apprentice star Karren picks out some highlights to look forward to during the show’s new season . . .Wyatt said: “Bill Cosby is doing great . . . Mr Cosby knows that God is watching over him . . . he knows that these are lies.“They persecuted Jesus and look what happened . . .  I’m not saying Mr Cosby is Jesus, but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries.”Just to be clear, Cosby’s conviction has nothing to do with race.The man is accused of rape and drug-facilitated sexual assault, by an astonishing 60 women . . . of all races and ages including some as young as 17.He has finally been put in prison and his victims have justice. He is a vile rapist, a violent sexual predator.His sentence is based on his crimes, not his colour.Unlike Cosby – a “disgusting sexual deviant” according to one of his victims – Jesus was innocent of the crimes laid against him.Cosby, meanwhile, has admitted to giving sedatives to young women in order to have sex with them.In short, Cosby admits his crimes, the jury find him guilty and the judge sentences him.Attempts to make this out as a racial issue are simply ridiculous.I KNOW it’s hard for men to face up to losing their hair, but someone needs to tell David Beckham that by far the best approach when it happens is . . . acceptance.But, judging from the photos of him looking a bit like a smiling Brillo pad this week that is not the route he is taking.David,  you are reading this, you are a handsome man and no one cares  you have a thick head of hair or not – please don’t turn into Shane Warne.I guess the reality star has yet to realise no one is forcing her to go out.She just needs to learn the power of saying no.In the past, I had a dreadful habit of saying yes to an engagement when I meant no, then spent days trying to think of ways to get out of it.I completely changed my le when I decided to simply things by saying yes to an invitation when I wanted to go – and no when I didn’t.IT’S hard to believe not only that West Midlands Police are allowing “thrill-seekers” to spend Halloween in a cell used by serial murderer Fred West – but that they are charging them £75 to do so.Offering this “spooky ghost hunt” at the notorious Steelhouse Lane cells in Birmingham is in very poor taste – so disrespectful of West’s victims, including his daughter who is a surviving casualty of his and is clearly still suffering every day.No doubt the relatives of those West murdered still suffer every day, too.So the fact that a stay in his old prison cell is being offered as Halloween entertainment is positively ghoulish.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU was set up to protect freedom.“It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving.Mr Hunt also issued a plea for warring Tory factions to come together and end their Brexit civil war.He added: “We can only unite the country  we are united ourselves. In Parliament. In the Government. And in the Cabinet”.Meanwhile hardline backbench Tory Brexiteers put on a concerted show of strength last night hinting they could oust the PM  she did not change her Chequers plan.Boris’s close ally Conor Burns took direct aim, warning: I say to the Prime Minister - we dont want to change you, we want you to change the policy of Chequers.And he urged her to please, please adopt a Canada style trade deal instead, suggesting the affection he held for the PM was at breaking point.And he was backed at the Brexit Central website rally by Jacob Rees Mogg, who said Chequers was “not only a dying duck in a thunderstorm, it’s the deadest dying duck in a thunderstorm.And he blasted campaigners for a so-called Peoples Vote, comparing them to Chinese communist and Libyan tyrant Gaddafi.He said: Once you put peoples in the title it is not true, it is about the elite, about those in charge and we should be very careful about that.A former Defence Minister also accused the PM of behaving like scheming Italian prince Machivelli and risked sending betrayed Tory voters into a political wilderness.Mark Francois - who served as Conservative frontbencher for 10 years - told The Sun the Chequers plan looks like “some Machiavellian process or series of backstairs deals” that has “sought to overturn their clearly expressed decision”.And he said the political weather meant those Brexit-loving Tory voters would be left homeless and may never vote again.A study yesterday revealed that Brexit is already costing the public purse £500m a week.The Centre for European Reform’s analysis found the UK economy is already 2.5% smaller than it would have been had Remain won the referendum.But in an attempt at a Brexit boost, ministers announced that the UK will host a nationwide Festival of Britain \u0026amp Northern Ireland in 2022.FORMER Labour Minister Digby Jones warned pro-business Tories must unite as “Jeremy Corbyn is to wealth creation what Diane Abbott is to mathematics”.SCOTS Tory MP Ross Thomson savaged the one word conference slogan “OPPORTUNITY”, raging: “I couldn’t help thinking of the other words ‘missed’, ‘lost’, ‘wasted’ and ‘squandered’.”TRANSPORT boss Chris Grayling’s own train to Birmingham was late — but he was spotted passing the time playing FarmVille on his phone rather than working.FORMER Remainer Jeremy Hunt delighted the Leave-backing party faithful by comparing the EU to the Soviet Union and then channelling Maggie Thatcher by telling Brussels “no, no, no”.TORY Peter Bone said ex-Ukip boss Nigel Farage should be made a Lord and put in charge of Brexit, adding: “If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Spreadsheet Phil possesses either supreme self-confidence or total contempt for the 17.4million who voted for Brexit, or both.The man who a year ago faced political death has become the most powerful figure in Theresa May’s Cabinet — perhaps including herself.She remains the figurehead. But the minister she planned to axe until her botched General Election is running the Brexit show from his Treasury eyrie.Hammond’s sympathetic image as Eeyore, a woebegone soft toy, is misleading. This man combines thin-skinned arrogance with a rare combination of political disabilities — cloth-eared, ham-fisted and leaden-footed.The grey image of bungled Budgets and barren creativity stands in vivid contrast to his outrageous Project Fear scaremongering. Mrs May certainly deserves blame for her hapless EU negotiations and the mutant Chequers plan for a Hi-Ho  Brexit.THE Tories have made a decent start to their conference – but they need to set their ambitions higher.Last week the Labour Party promised easy answers on everything from housing to the economy. It was a radical,  utterly disastrous, vision for Britain.The Government changing tipping rules and increasing taxes on foreign property buyers is pretty small beer.Not least since the former was first announced three years ago and the latter is pretty much copied from last year’s Labour manesto.Philip Hammond — rarely mistaken for a ray of sunshine — needs to provide light at the end of the austerity tunnel.He must lay the groundwork for entrepreneurs to thrive in a newly liberated, unapologetically free market economy.And he should challenge business to work with him, too. The self-appointed “voices of British business”, iniably dominated by large corporate interests, push every day for more and more Brexit concessions.Yet as last week showed, Labour’s unreconstructed Marxism is a far more serious threat to future prosperity than any kind of Brexit.It’s time for big businesses to play their part in building a better Britain, rather than refighting a referendum which was as much a vote against them as the political establishment.Eeyore Hammond must encourage them to invest in Britain’s future.She survived last year’s election catastrophe only because Remainers feared a true Brexiteer such as Boris Johnson might replace her.Hammond has since deployed his Treasury reach to capitalise on her weakness and box us into BRINO — Brexit In Name Only. Mrs May is the willing captive of passionate Remainers in Downing Street, Whitehall, the Cabinet Office and, crucially, the all-powerful Treasury.Since the departure of close aide Nick Timothy, there is nobody within earshot who voted Brexit — including Mrs May. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, like his predecessor David Davis, has virtually no say in negotiations.Hammond now calls the shots, backed by panic-stirring Business Secretary Greg Clark and Europhile Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.Brexiteers fear this Unholy Trinity is ready for more concessions over issues including migration, EU benefits and Britain’s vital financial services industry.Never forget, it was Hammond who blocked all spending and therefore all serious preparation for No Deal, a prospect now apparently facing this nation. In fact there was never a chance of No Deal.We will end up with a form of Chequers, but one even more pro-Brussels than the proposal which saw David Davis and BoJo storm out. Remainers are back in full Project Fear mode.European car firms are happily pouring billions into Britain — despite Brexit. Yet Greg Clark triggered last week’s chorus of fake alarm from Toyota, claiming its “just-in-time” supply chain would grind to a halt.This ignores the whole point of “just-in-time”. It is designed specically to cope with delivery glitches and operates worldwide in all circumstances under global trade rules.It was also Clark who handed Brussels its biggest anti-Brexit card by promising those shroud-waving car giants the UK would remain under EU rules. That led directly to Mrs May’s surrender over the Northern Ireland border, which has plagued negotiations ever since.It is a tragic fact — but no surprise — that we are now heading remorselessly for a deal on EU terms at our expense.EU leaders were never going to see us thrive outside. They insisted we will not be better off after Brexit.Anyone who hoped we might be set free to compete on equal terms should read ex-Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis’ story of his own country’s punishment beating.It was Varoufakis who compared Brexit with the Eagles’ hit: “It’s like Hotel Calornia — you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” And we can blame Phil Hammond for blocking the fire Brexits.But Ms Jourova, a Czech raised under Soviet rule, wants Corbyn-style “regulation” of the free Press.The apple never falls far from the tree.PS.

Railways? Nationalise them.“Wealth? Confiscate it. Run out of money? Just borrow more.“Answers from a discredited ideology that will never solve real-world problems.”And he finished his crowd-pleasing speech by saying: Corbyn’s plan offers no future for Britain. And it is our duty to provide a better answer.To make the case for the long term over the short term, for the substantial over the superficial, for evolution over revolution.He claimed Labours extreme plans deserve a response and warned it wont be enough to offer up milder versions of the left-wing policies favoured by Mr Corbyn.Mr Hammond said: We will not outbid Corbyn with short-term gimmicks that cause long-term damage we will not outspend him with reckless borrowing.Michael Gove also used his conference speech to hit out at Labour, saying: “Harold Wilson used to say the Labour party was a moral crusade or it was nothing.“Now Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party is a toxic cocktail of unrepentant Marxism-Leninism and unacceptable antisemitism.“Let us commit to unite so that the Moscow-loving, Hamas-hugging, high-taxing, moderate-bashing, job-destroying, National Anthem-avoiding, NATO-hating, class war-provoking, one-man museum of economic folly that is Jeremy Corbyn, is never let anywhere near Downing Street.”But the Chancellor risked sparking a backlash from his own activists as he insisted Britain will have to remain closely tied to Europe after Brexit.He said: Whatever the outcome, Europe will remain firmly anchored just a few miles off the coast of Kent.Europe remains, by far, our biggest market. And after 45 years of membership, Britain’s economy has shaped itself around that fact.Mr Hammond predicted a deal idend which will see the UKs economy boom once we strike a trade deal with the EU.And he laid out a series of policies to boost the economy including:“The Tories are bereft of any fresh ideas, forced to resort to a half-hearted filching of policies from others and desperately trying to revive long outdated slogans."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000438425964-e1538402486566.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bremeridge manor dilton wiltshire county manor sale treasure","story":"Bremeridge Manor, in Dilton Marsh, Wiltshire dates back to 1166 and was once the home of King Henry VIII, Queen Elizabeth I and King James I.The Grade II listed building is now up for grabs, but it could be hiding something very valuable indeed.In 1878 a hoard of 14th century gold coins was discovered buried under the property when workmen were building an extension.It has been suggested that gold could still be lurking in the grounds waiting to be discovered.Guests can enter the grand property through a huge oak door thought to be over 300 years old and toast themselves by the same fireplace used by royalty.The house is surrounded by vast greenery with well-manicured lawns and trimmed trees, complete with its own lake.Unbelievably it is going for half the price of a Kensington flat with two bedrooms, bathroom and a living/dining room.It has 3,513 sq ft of accommodation with a sitting room, dining room, kitchen/breakfast room, drawing room, study, a main bedroom with en-suite bathroom and dressing room, another three bedrooms and two bathrooms.According to records, the manor was acquired by an order of monks, the Bonhommes of Edington, in 1366.It was then passed to Henry VIII when he dissolved the monasteries between 1536 and 1541 and was then sold off to James Blount - Lord Mountjoy.He sold it back to the monarchy in 1574 when it was bought by Queen Elizabeth I, who visited the nearby Longleat House in the same year.Previous owner Evan Morgans said: It was a few months after I had moved in that I began to research the history of the house.Its truly mind-boggling to discover that you can trace a history of continuous occupancy of your house from yourself, going back to 1166 when the first recorded owner died.That is 835 years of knowing every owner, every lessee and every tenant.

She was prescribed the anti-depressant Citalopram, as well as Zopiclone, a sleeping medication.When I saw her in December 2017 she reported she was feeling much better and said she was looking forward to Christmas.Miss Pococks partner, Mr Smith, awoke at 8.30am to hear their young son crying from his bedroom.When he had picked up the tot he looked down the stairs to see the boys mother hanging at the bottom of the stairs.The coroner, sitting in Reading, Berkshire, heard that Mr Smith put his son back to bed and called 999.Detective Constable Stephens went to the scene and also provided a report for Mrs Connor.He said: Mr Smith arrived back home on April 19 at about 11:30 pm and he found Miss Pocock drinking Corona beer.They went to bed and, at approximately 1:30am, Mr Smith woke up and his partner was still asleep next to him.At 8.30am he awoke to his son crying and went to get him up. He then noticed Miss Pococks body at the bottom of the stairs.He put his son back in his room and called 999.

It was a quiet week, so I watched the first four episodes and, to my surprise and delight, I hated Press even more than I expected.The set-up’s the deal-breaker, of course. We’ve got a right-wing red-top called The Post, that’s very obviously meant to be The Sun, and a left-wing broadsheet The Herald, which is equally obviously , house Bible of the BBC.The former is edited by soul-selling clone Duncan Allen, played by the brilliant Ben Chaplin, who does actually resemble a couple of ex-colleagues.By rights then, the female lead should be The Herald’s editor, Amina Chaudury, played by Priyanga Burford.But she can’t act, so the responsibility’s fallen to Charlotte Riley as northern, working-class brick of Deputy News Editor Holly Evans, who fits the social profile of your average  woman about as comfortably as Roy Chubby Brown fits a mankini.Next weird thing you probably notice about Press is that nearly all the characters are giving speeches, rather than talking normally to each other.Especially the insufferable broadsheet hacks, who never stop reminding each other “we speak the truth to the powerful”, and that “people buy The Herald for the truth”.Why do people buy The Post/Sun?It’s never really occurred to writer Mike “Doctor Foster” Bartlett, who clearly didn’t read our newspaper before he sat down to type Press, at his desk on the summit of Mount Olympus, and has probably never met a tabloid reader either, without telling them: “Keep the change.”How can I be so sure?Because it’s got almost every single professional and technical aspect wrong, from Duncan’s insistence he’s going to do a spread “On page five and six” , to the week one headline The Post produced about the gay, blackmailed footballer who committed suicide: “Parents never knew their son.”Which is the sort of meaningless, esoteric b******s that would get thrown back at a student newspaper sub.That’s another unconvincing thing about Press, incidentally. No one swears. And I wouldn’t mind so much  there were some decent stories to see us through, but there aren’t.There’s a Katie Hopkins figure floating around, a few cut-and-pasted bits of very old tabloid legend  and some deep state conspiracy cobblers, which the BBC’s probably got written into Raa Raa The Noisy Lion these days.Duncan also has the vague hots for Holly, until such time as Ed off the newsdesk tells him she likes having it off in a grey vest.That’s about your lot, though.As always happens when British TV tries to dramatise the Press, the writer’s left-of-centre political agenda and prejudices trump everything else.This is why Americans do it so much better, and  you want to see how newspapers really operate you’ll get a much better idea from Billy Wilder’s 1974 film The Front Page than you ever will from Press.I’ll say this for the BBC production team though, they might not have much of an ear for newspaper dialogue, but they’ve got a hell of an eye for interior design and have duplicated one item of our office kitchen crockery perfectly.Mugs.“I don’t bend in the middle any more, to be honest.”Then just slap him around a bit.Improvise, woman.FURTHER proof,  it were needed, there’s not a single television format that can’t be improved by the presence of one or two of the Happy Mondays arrived on Friday.A special BBC Music Day edition of Bargain Hunt, featuring Bez and Rowetta versus Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle, which will go down in daytime TV folklore.Attempting to keep them in some sort of order, at the Kent showground’s antique fair, was BH regular Charlie Ross, who didn’t get very far with his preliminary question: “How did it all start with the Happy Mondays, Bez?”“You really don’t want to know.”So you really couldn’t blame him for looking a bit nervous when he sent the pair of them away with £300 in used notes.Half an hour later, though, Bez and Rowetta were back, with three items, including a biscuit tin and a to-die-for rustic, bygone horse collar mirror that’s yours for just 30 quid.It made them a respectable £8 profit at auction, as well, and flattened Pulp’s efforts in the process.At which point things got a bit dark.Charlie noted “an irregularity”, the Mondays were hauled back on set, like guilty schoolkids, and the host was forced to explain that the winsome and very obliging woman at the back of the auction hall, who kept bidding for his items was in fact: “Bez’s girlfriend.”Not angry, Bez, just disappointed.IF you’ve never seen the brilliant Simpsons episode where Homer gives Pinchy, his pet lobster, a really hot bath, Google it as soon as you can.Then immediately after, watch Channel 4’s darkly funny latest episode of Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where a pig wandered into camp, on Sunday night.Even more obligingly it then started fattening itself up on the celebs’ leftovers and inviting the obvious by crapping its load everywhere.While some sensed dinner, Towie’s Pete Wicks had a better idea.He named the pig Colin, took it for a walk and then tethered it with a rope to some rocks.Whereupon Colin, with the sort of demonic squeals and grunts you last heard on Deliverance, promptly strangled himself to death.Presented with this tragedy, you or I or Martin Kemp from Spandau Ballet, might’ve drawn the obvious conclusion and, like Homer Simpson, tucked in Not this lot.Instead Colin was buried at sea, with full military honours, to avoid “hurting Pete’s feelings”, floating off into the sunset like a warning to humanity.This MorningSemra Haksever: “I call myself an eclectic witch, so I take dferent little bits of magic from all over the place.So it’s all b******sOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I like a lot the Brits but now they need to help us and they said they will do that, but we need a concrete arrangement.The Belgian minister, who is championing a tough Australian-style immigration system to secure Europes outer borders, also warned Brexit wont help reduce the flow.He said: They will not stop because youre out of the EU, the EU has nothing to do with this.

The crowd-pleaser was the gem of his keynote speech to the Tories’ annual conference in Birmingham.But he also used it to spell out a vision to harness the unfolding technology revolution to improve angry Brits’ lives. If was Mr Hammond’s rival offer to defeat hard-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s Socialist blueprint.Mr Hammond told the conference: “Global internet giants must contribute fairly to funding our public services. The best way to tax international companies is through international agreements.“But the time for talking is coming to an end and the stalling has to stop. If we cannot reach agreement, the UK will go it alone with a Digital Services Tax of its own.”The Chancellor will push ahead with the move after losing patience with the US.Despite repeated promises for global action to end the tax dodge, President Trump’s administration is still stalling on a solution as it reaps billions from the firms, with so many based on the US’s West Coast.Britain is instead now looking at Europe-wide action, as France is also keen for something to be done. The Treasury is also consulting on a second online levy, an Online Sales Tax, to force digital retailers such as Amazon to pay more tax too.But sources close to the Chancellor said he is going cold on that as he fears the giants will just pass it straight on to consumers.The Cabinet has been under heavy pressure to combat Mr Corbyn’s polished offer of Socialist solutions to angry voters’ woes during a successful Labour conference last week.Mr Hammond tackled the Labour boss head-on yesterday, by pledging to “harness the power of the market economy” instead of “a discredited ideology that will never solve real-world problems”.He insisted Tories must face up to the anger among many British workers, saying: “Too many feel they are working for the system, but the system isn’t working for them.“So our challenge is to ensure 21st-century capitalism delivers for those people. It will be this technological transformation, and how we manage it — not Brexit — that will define the future of our country and our party.”Mr Hammond added: “Show them that, crucially, the change that technology is driving will address their concerns, not make them worse.“If we look for a moment like the party of “no change”, then we should not be surprised that some will be tempted by the dangerous populism of our opponents.”Mr Hammond also answered the calls of big business who have been stung by PM Theresa May’s attack on excess profits and boardroom culture. Tory donor and City billionaire Michael Spencer said the party had “lost its way” on business, accusing the PM of “letting herself down”.But the Chancellor said: “Let me say it, loud and clear: the Conservative Party is, and always will be, the party of business. That means we listen to business.” And in a change of tone on Brexit, a more positive Mr Hammond also predicted a “deal idend” that could fund tax cuts and public service spending once a deal is reached.He also said the Treasury was keeping sufficient “fiscal firepower” to hand to deal with any economic fallout from a No-Deal Brexit.BRITAIN still lacks the confidence to intervene in foreign wars due to the disasters of Iraq and Afghanistan, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has said.THERESA May had party bosses on the Tory backbench 1922 Committee blushing by making a rather risque gag about them giving her pleasure.

In contrast, the over-75s are positively chipper: Only 27 per cent of this group reported feelings of isolation.Now, I’m 24 and, depressingly, these statistics don’t surprise me.At first glance, it looks like young people have it easy when it comes to making friends.At 18 or thereabouts, more than 50 per cent of them will be packed off to university where they’ll move in with a group of like-minded people of the same age and be encouraged to drink and party like there’s no tomorrow.Which, when you’re only required to stumble out of bed for one 2pm lecture, there essentially isn’t.Rather than relying on friends of tenuous friends for dubious introductions, young people these days can simply download an app and get the details of thousands of eligible strangers delivered straight to their mobile phones.Add into the mix social media ­— which allows its users to connect with everyone they’ve ever met instantaneously at any given moment — and it’s hard to imagine how any young people could possibly be lonely, let alone 40 per cent.But there are two sides to every coin.University — though a godsend when it comes to meeting new people — can be a problem when it comes to staying in touch with them. Saddled with bottomless debt, young graduates simply don’t have the cash to socialise.When a round for six at a London pub will set you back 40 quid, is it any wonder that more and more young people are opting to stay at home?Dating apps, too, come with their pitfalls. Yes, it’s nice to have a database of singletons in your pocket, but the ubiquity of Tinder and Bumble mean it’s now considered almost socially awkward to speak to someone you fancy in person.A friend of mine, who has absolutely no problem propositioning women on Tinder, hasn’t yet found the courage to ask for his next-door neighbour’s number, four months after she moved in.As for social media, young people like me are increasingly discovering that “staying connected” is a mixed blessing at best. With no excuse to lose touch, my generation holds on to friends we’ve outgrown, leaving us with no time to make new ones. It may sound callous, but there’s an art to shedding friends, and thanks to our social media addiction, we seem to have lost it.What’s more, earnest 16 to 24-year-olds seem to be taking to heart the faddish health advice that adults have been merrily ignoring for years, making it even harder for them to socialise because they fear alcohol, and even food.At the end of a recent party I got chatting to a fun young woman, so I suggested some pub grub at a boozer to round off the evening. How wrong I was.She explained in detail she was vegan and on a gluten-free diet , so the pub menu would not cater for her needs.I decided not to pursue it.So I say it’s time snowflake millennials took a bit of responsibility for their own feelings of isolation.Last month commentators wagged their fingers at the big tech companies after a survey by charity YoungMinds revealed a greater number of young people view social media as having a negative impact on the way they feel about themselves than those who report a positive impact.But it was never suggested depressed young people should simply put away their phones and do something else.Mollycoddled millennials believe having a thriving social circle is a human right, rather than an ongoing project.Instead of popping to the pub for a pick-me-up with whoever happens to be around, a lonely young person will all too often turn to the internet for a spot of indulgent self-reflection, or to the gym for Insta-friendly self-improvement.As a result, pubs are closing at a rate of 18 a day, and sites such as Tumblr are overflowing with posters instructing users to “forget the haters” and “shine like the star that you are”.Of course, social media is made to be addictive. But surely putting down a phone can’t be an insurmountable challenge for an educated generation of young people? Dwelling on yourself is the surest route to a lonely lestyle, so instead of posting doleful, introspective memes on social media or clinging to tired old friendships, lonely young people should find the guts to get outside and look outwards.Making and keeping real friends takes work, and it’s time young people started putting the hours in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the empty seats reached a nadir for the late-afternoon speech of the new Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright.Now admittedly it was the graveyard slot at the end of the day, but there were fewer than 200 in the 2,262-seat Symphony Hall in Birmingham\u0027s International Convention Centre.Earlier, during Philip Hammond\u0027s big speech on the economy just before lunch, there were also big gaps of empty seats in the hall.

At Labour\u0027s conference there were passionate debates - on re-selection of MPs and Brexit, for example - and there were fiery speeches from the floor.That was a deliberate policy: more speeches by activists from the floor and fewer by MPs and shadow ministers from the platform.

Now imagine being in the situation where more people would have turned up to see your speech  you hadn’t turned up yourself. That’s the position Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright was in this afternoon. You see, Jeremy was originally supposed to deliver his speech to Conservative Party Conference as a hologram. A projection. A digital apparition. It was the brainchild of his predecessor, Matt Hancock - now Health Secretary, and much more comfortable in the ‘Minister of Fun’ brief than Wright. You remember him. He’s the one who did Parkour.  And had his own app - called Matt Hancock - which wasn’t very good, but at the very least didn’t leak the Defence Secretary’s mobile number to literally anyone who wanted it. Before Theresa May’s last reshuffle, The Right Honourable Jeremy Wright QC was the attorney general. The government’s top lawyer.  I’ve seen Wright deliver learned, competent speeches about tricky subjects like cyber security. He was quite good at it.  Which made his move to Culture, where he\u0027d have to talk about sport  and music  even more baffling. But while the hologram stunt might have been infinitely better suited to Matt Hancock\u0027s talents, at least it would have given Jeremy a bit of pizazz.   Wright, a curious charisma vacuum, took to the stage to tell an anecdote about his school play to a concert hall barely busier than the upper room was for the Last Supper. “When I was 13, I was shy and didn\u0027t much like being the centre of attention. I’ve changed,” he joked, fooling nobody. He went on: “But that year I was persuaded to take a large part in a school play. “The effect on my self-confidence, on what I felt I could do, was signicant and long-lasting. “So much so that I feel able to say to you that  I had not stood on that stage then, I would not be standing on this stage now.”  It’s hard to think that when Wright wrote those lines into his speech, he’d imagined delivering them them to a crowd which could have comfortably fit in the school hall which saw his theatrical debut. A conservative estimate - pun intended - put the size of the party faithful somewhere just south of 200, scattered through the four levels of Birmingham’s cavernous Symphony Hall. I genuinely just went into the hall to see how sparse the crowd was, but so empty was the auditorium I almost felt obliged to keep my seat until the end of his address to make up the numbers. It’s not just him, though he was the most pathetic example. There were plenty of seats free for Chancellor Philip Hammond’s speech. There was no compunction to turn up early for Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, or even Tory conference favourite Ruth Davidson, who gave a speech which hit all the right notes, but was never going to win a Grammy.

Dominic Raab said the government will “pull every lever we\u0027ve got” to ease business “disruption”  the UK leaves the EU with no agreement in March 2019. The Brexit Secretary even left open a radical idea of slashing corporation tax from 19% to 10% - which would firms a huge tax break while millions of working families struggle. He spoke on the fringes of the Tory conference hours after Chancellor Philip Hammond said he was reserving “fiscal firepower” to “support the economy” in No Deal Brexit.  Mr Raab was asked his view on an idea by Chloe Westley, of the right-wing TaxPayers Alliance think tank, of dropping corporation tax to 10% - and using tax to get a “post-Brexit boom”. The Cabinet minister replied: “You just said Chloe wants to reduce corporation tax to 10% - and the Chancellor\u0027s talked about reserving fiscal firepower in the case of no deal. “What more do you want? “Of course he\u0027s talking about the recognition that actually, in the no deal scenario, we want to pull every lever we\u0027ve got to see us through what short term buffeting or disruption we have. “I think the Chancellor gave a brilliant speech and it shows you we\u0027re all rowing the same boat.”  Mr Raab is a free marketeer who in 2011 proposed scrapping the minimum wage for some under-21s. Indicating other Cabinet ministers may back his view, Mr Raab laughed and added: “People were coming to this conference expecting it to be dynamite. “Actually now the journalists are all complaining to me that there\u0027s not really much going on, there seems to be far too much of people singing from the same hymn sheet.” “I think the Chancellor gave a great speech, not just talking about what we would do in no deal, but talking about the advantages economically for the country  we get the Chequers deal across the line.” It comes days after Theresa May pledged to cut Brexit Britain\u0027s corporation tax rate to the lowest in the G20 – a title currently held by Singapore on 17%. Tory governments have already slashed the rate from 28% in 2010. With weeks left to secure a deal, Mr Raab suggested EU chiefs had “weaponised” the deadlock over the Irish border to get leverage. “I think there has been a bit of that,” he said. “There is no doubt there are some that have enjoyed politicising this issue – I say enjoyed, have taken the opportunity.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tory philip hammond deliberately used","story":"NewsTory Philip Hammond \u0027deliberately used Brexit forecasts he knew were wrong\u0027 in No Deal plansThe former Brexit secretary accused Mr Hammond of undermining negotiations and claimed he turned predictions about the impact of crashing out into \"weapons\"Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsBySam Lister14:52, 1 OCT 2018NewsChancellor Philip Hammond used forecasts he knew were inaccurate, it\u0027s been claimed \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Chancellor Philip Hammond used forecasts he knew were inaccurate during preparations for a no-deal Brexit , David Davis has claimed.

He said Mr Hammond was using a forecast which internally the reports said was inaccurate and did not reflect the future when preparations were being made for a no-deal outcome.

Welcome to the Conservative Party conference of 2018, where the Tories are trying to pretend they can organise a knees-up that doesn\u0027t somehow end in whacking themselves in the testicles.  It\u0027s day one, and they\u0027ve already failed. Their Great Blond Hope has not only been victim of a Big Daddy splash by Lord Digby Jones, he\u0027s been impersonated by Phil \u0027Voldemort\u0027 Hammond and had his ideas characterised as not much good by David \u0027Mine Are No Better\u0027 Davis.  We are now uncomfortably close to the arbitrary date for leaving the European Union, chosen by a Prime Minister who herself was chosen because she wasn\u0027t someone else, and as is the way with things on horizons it looks worryingly like an out-of-control hydrogen explosion.  We all know what\u0027s happened - the referendum supposed to uny the Tories has caused them to turn on each other like cannibals who gave up chlorinated chicken for Lent, the question supposed to be settled for a generation remains unanswered, and Theresa May is still PM primarily because she isn\u0027t someone else.  So what is Brexit going to look like, under the Tories? 1. Project Oh Dear   Jeremy Hunt is a man who has more in common with an Anglepoise lamp than the rest of the human race. He can be pointed, turned on, and turned off again, but usually fails to illuminate anyone. He is now second-favourite to be Prime Minister next year, which should be adequate proof of just how boked the Tories are.  Boris is trolling, Sajid and Gavin are manoeuvring, Chris Grayling is in a siding outside Melton Mowbray and Hunt - a man who, the Leveson Inquiry heard, tried to hide behind trees to avoid journalists while still being visible to them - is now, let me say it again, one of the favourites. It\u0027s a bit like saying the green Opal Fruit is your favourite. Or that the USSR, which invaded countries that tried to leave it and killed millions, is just like the EU, which negotiates, even with people who don\u0027t know what they\u0027re doing. 2. Project You Can\u0027t Be Serious  Having toured the country in a bus promising to give our EU subscription to the NHS, the Tories have since said: a we\u0027ll still have to pay a subscription b it will be higher, without a rebate  c by the way, we\u0027ll be cutting \u0026pound2.7bn off the NHS  Today the spiritual leader of the Brextremists has suggested we spend our foreign aid budget on saving elephants, because they remind him of Beethoven\u0027s Fth Symphony. Hang the education projects, stuff the small-scale charities who exist entirely because of foreign aid, and let\u0027s get all worked up about the 70 pence in every \u0026pound100 national profit that we spend on foreigners. Boo hiss to foreigners! Elephants are British! Wait, what? 3. Project Is This Really The Best You Could Do  Brexit, the Tories are assuring us and their donors, will mean a bonfire of unnecessary rules and regulations about meaningless, bureaucratic tripe like child car seats, not getting killed at work and hiding your money from the taxman.  It gives us a chance to set our own rules such as only banning dangerous cladding 15 months after it burned 72 people alive, and only  it\u0027s on new buildings, which means all the people living in older properties can go sizzle.  It also won\u0027t matter  you sleep surrounded by highly-flammable material on the sixth floor, or  you don\u0027t have a sprinkler system, or the fire exits are blocked or non-existent. After Brexit, you won\u0027t want to live anyway. 4. Project Genuine Fear  The government of the UK is trying to exit a union it doesn\u0027t want while protecting one that it does. To do so they are relying on a referendum they say must be respected, while ignoring a referendum they say must be over-ridden.  All the people concerned were told beforehand that Brexit would spell the end of the Good Friday Agreement, a hard-won peace in Northern Ireland, and possibly the end of the Union altogether. That they have now, 6 months from doom, had this explained to them again by a comedian shows just what a bad joke the Tories are.  Patrick Kielty\u0027s dad was murdered by the Ulster Freedom Fighters for exposing their organised crime. The Tories\u0027 border solution involves asking those self-same people to pretend there\u0027s a border where there isn\u0027t one, and file paperwork well in advance before smuggling guns, drugs and people across 300 miles of hedge that we can\u0027t police. Laugh? You\u0027ll die. 5. Project It All Onto Someone Else   Presiding over economic chaos? Watching John Lewis go down the pan, the world turn against you, and Jacob Rees-Mogg destroying all his own suggestions by moving his investment funds to the EU and trying to get a trade deal with the People\u0027s Republic of Jam Jar Or Something Like That?   Well, why not shoot some more badgers. Not in the head, that\u0027s too quick. Kneecap them and watch them suffer. Burn some cattle, bankrupt some farmers, blame it all on the EU\u0027s crazy rules about bovine TB which isn\u0027t harmless so long as you pasteurise your milk, mostly doesn\u0027t kill cows and could easily be stopped with a vaccine  only we could be bothered.  When someone says \u0027but Brexit means we can abandon these rules! Save the badgers!\u0027 point out we still have to abide by EU rules  we want to sell beef, milk or cheese to the EU. And don\u0027t, for heaven\u0027s sake, let anyone say that the only way to change those rules is to, er, remain in the EU.  With a Tory Brexit, hard or soft, you\u0027re looking at Jeremy Hunt being in charge while making swingeing NHS cuts, making it quite the worst reboot of a franchise since Indiana Jones And The Hospital Of Doom.  You\u0027ll see people burning in another tower block before long, a fresh wave of terrorism when we haven\u0027t dealt with the current one, and Tories blaming badgers, migrants, and anything else that moved because, after Brexit, they\u0027ll no longer be able to blame the EU. The Tories have spent the past 40 years blaming Europe for all the things they cocked up themselves. Without the EU, people are going to blame the Tories. Which is why their days are numbered.

Wojciech Karuzel was driving behind a white Audi on when he thought he noticed the dirty potty being poured out through an open window. Dashcam footage shows what seems to be a green potty being shoved out of the driver\u0027s side seat in the back of the car. The person turns it over and the remnants can be seen dripping onto the street below, before the Audi drives off on Newmarket Road in Cambridge.  Mr Karuzel told Cambridgeshire Live : We noticed that someone had the potty outside the window and poured it on the street, it was weird and a little bit disgusting.   The 38-year-old noticed a young child moving around in the back of the car before the potty was poured out. He said: The other thing, I quickly noticed the child was jumping around in the car. He added: I think it\u0027s wrong what they did. On Newmarket Road there are car parks one after another. If the child needs a wee they can pull into a car park and do everything that\u0027s needed and then be on their way again, not while moving in traffic. I was quite appalled.  Mr Karuzel, who has two children himself, said it\u0027s something no parent should do because not only is it disgusting but also unsafe.   It\u0027s so risky, it was unsafe, a child should be in a child car seat no matter what.  I could see the child was moving . It didn\u0027t look as  the child was strapped in.   As a father Mr Karuzel said he understands that parents might have been trying to be consistent with potty training but still thinks chucking a full potty out the window is never ok. I might have understood trying to potty train a child and having that potty with them, but I would never think of it being used while moving. It shouldn\u0027t be done. He added: I have two children and I would never consider doing that. I would stop the car where possible and take the child to bushes or somewhere. It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve seen anything like that. The child safety is concerning. The child must be in the car seat  moving and even  the car is in traffic it should never be unbuckled. The incident happened on Wednesday, September 26 and Mr Karuzel says he\u0027s still shocked by what he saw. He said: It did take me by surprise. I did not expect a potty being emptied through the window. So that was very surprising.

Tanya Cox, 38, from Hull, has been working in the industry since she was 27 but says she often thinks about getting a real job. She was scouted as a glamour model while working as a lap dancer and says her past experience enabled her to be comfortable in front of the camera. Despite loving her job, Tanya says she thought about giving up her career when jobs dried up after she turned 30, reports the Hull Daily Mail. However, she\u0027s now finding success again as she breaks into the \u0027mature market\u0027. How did you get into modelling and was it something you always wanted to do? I never really thought about doing any modelling work but whilst I was working as a lap dancer, I got approached by an agency and was asked  I would consider doing any modelling work.     I was quite shocked as I thought you had to be tall and skinny to do any kind of modelling but they reassured me that was just the fashion industry and that I was perfect for glamour. How old were you and how long have you been doing it? I came into the industry at 27 and I’m now 38. What was it like at first and what kind of things you were doing? Having already worked as a lap dancer for three years, I was very comfortable with modelling straight away. I think its the taking your clothes off bit that worries most new glamour models but as I had already been doing that for three years, that was the easy part, it was learning to find the light and what angles suited me that took the time the learn. Was you aware of any challenges the industry faced at the beginning? No, when I first came into the industry, everything seemed great, people were much more reliable with higher standards always putting quality first back then. But now its more quantity over quality and trying to get as much as possible shot in the time frame are booked for. Was there ever a point where you regretted getting into modelling? When I first turned 30, my work really quietened off as some companies considered me too old for the young market but I still looked too young to break the mature market. It was a very low point in my le and feeling my career slip away made me so depressed at times that I wished I never started. What has been the best things about it? Are there any moments which stand out where you loved it? I think for me, it helped me to find my own inner strength. I was guilty of never sticking up for myself when I was younger but now I\u0027m the first to say when anyone is out of order, whether it\u0027s towards myself, a friend or even a stranger. Also through modelling and dancing, I have now met the best friends that I have ever had. I trust them completely and never doubt anymore that they all love me, as much as I love them. What has been some of the worst things about it? The worst thing about modelling is the high cancellation rates which has been getting worse and worse each year since 2010, but I don\u0027t think that is just an industry problem, I think society in general has forgotten its manners because I have noticed that more and more people cancel social meets with friends than ever before too.  Have you ever been judged based on your career? What do you think of that? Not in my personal le, but since my work started to quieten off and I have been trying to get a \u0027normal job\u0027, I do feel like employers are discriminating against me as I don\u0027t even seem to be able to get an interview these days, and when I was younger I always found it so easy to get work. When a place I worked at closed down, I had a new job within a week. How successful have you been? I felt pretty successful when I was younger but I do think I would of had a better career had I started when I was younger as it only lasted a few years before my peak ran out. I am now just starting to finally break the mature market, so fingers crossed I can make a success of that, but early days yet. Modelling must have changed since you started - have you seen that and in what way? It certainly has, all the technology keeps changing, I don\u0027t know how the photographers keep up. And unfortunately the budgets aren\u0027t as big anymore. I really miss the days of make-up artists and clothing departments on all shoots, but these days its only the very biggest companies that provide those now and for most shoots we just get a list of what types clothing to bring with us and have to do our own hair and make-up. Do you think it will change in the future and in what way? We are seeing dferent types of models coming through now We are and I love that we are now celebrating ersity with models now coming in dferent shapes, sizes, styles and ages. I met a new model on set recently who had just started doing topless modelling at 52. Social media has also come to the forefront and many models experience trolling - is that something you\u0027ve experienced? Yes, I have had a few negative comments but, for every bad comment I get, there is always at least 20 positive comments to counter-act it and the troll then usually ends up getting loads of grief for his/her comment anyway so it always back fires on them.  Would you advise someone to get into the industry? What would your advice be and how would they go about getting a break? Although when times are good, it\u0027s not just a job to me, it is my le and I do love modelling but because of how dficult I have found trying to find a \u0027normal job\u0027 since, no I wouldn\u0027t recommend anyone getting into the industry. But  someone is 100 per cent certain that it\u0027s what they want to do, I recommend joining the online portfolio sites over an agency so you can speak to the photographers you are shooting for direct yourself as the agencies don\u0027t always give you the right information. Just make sure you always check references and remember you should never do anything that your not comfortable with. Is age a big thing in modelling and have you ever felt stigmatised by others in the industry? There is definitely more work for younger models, but thanks to films like American Pie making MILFS, GILFS and Cougars sexy, it has opened up the industry to mature models too which is great but the down side is that once your above 30, everyone feels the need to point out the fact that your older by using the terms MILF/Cougar etc alongside all your publications. I am still struggling with this eight years on as I keep getting called a MILF and find the term really offensive. Looking back now, do you feel empowered by it all? I feel that the industry has helped me to realise that it is OK to just be myself and that my imperfections make me human, approachable and more relatable. What agency are you with? I\u0027m not with any agencies anymore. They did help get me work when I was new but once you are established, the bookings come to you direct and I also had a problems with been given the wrong information and been sent on jobs for levels I don\u0027t cover.

Mike Glover-Johnson, 46, was sitting in his car in Bloxwich, West Midlands when a masked man hurled a substance in his face.  He was attacked at 6.50pm on Sunday while waiting for his husband Lee to collect a pizza from Chunky Grill.  While police have since ruled out a corrosive substance being used in the robbery, they believe a liquid was doused on Mike\u0027s face to distract him while his laptop was stolen.  Detectives are continuing to appeal for information to identy the suspect who escaped in a blue car after the attack. CCTV from the takeaway captured the attack which shows a hooded man open his car door before throwing what he had believed to be acid in his face.  After spraying the substance into Mike\u0027s face, he runs into a blue car and drives away while his victim staggers into the eatery. After leaving the takeaway Mike was helped by locals who poured buckets of water over him. Mike previously claimed that staff gave two bottles of water to pour over his burning face before being told he would have to pay for a third. He added they were then kicked out of the restaurant forcing him to receive further treatment on the street.  But the owner of Chunky Grill has denied charging Mike for the water. Owner Sayed Hashmi told  that after handing him a bottle of water free of charge, staff then brought him buckets to pour over himself. Writing on Facebook, he said: “We did give them water and we didn’t turn them away from the restaurant. “In the footage seen in the presence of police shows that Mr Mike has been helped and assisted. “Deeply feel sorry for misunderstanding created that Mike has been charged for a bottle of water.” Mike posted a picture of his bandaged face and thanked people for their quick reactions which he suggested could have stopped scarring from what he initially believed was acid.

And nearly half  of teachers with three to five years experience would emigrate at short notice. The top reasons for moving abroad include work-le balance, bureaucracy, lack of respect for teachers, government policy and disruptive pupils. A study by Tes magazine based on a survey of 1009 teachers reveals over two thirds  would consider working abroad.  Teachers in core subjects including English , maths  and science  teachers all say they would consider moving abroad within a term The findings come at a time when pupil numbers in secondary schools are rising, which is already projected to mean an extra 47,000 teachers will be needed by 2024. Work-le balance was the biggest reason for teachers in most subjects, maths teachers revealed their biggest frustration is a lack of respect for the profession . A lack of respect for teachers also peaked in importance among those reaching five years’ experience - a point at which official data shows many qualied teachers exit the profession for good. The survey revealed that secondary teachers were less happy than primary, with 41% saying they would move, compared to 29% of primary colleagues. English teachers were more likely to consider a move  than humanities , maths  or science teachers . Between 2011 and 2017, the number of teachers quitting within five years rose from just under a quarter to around a third.

More and more females are said to be \u0027rejecting\u0027 monogamy and cheating on their spouses - despite saying they still love them.  They are now reportedly more likely to cheat than three decades ago, with increased autonomy, earning power and opportunity. Women are 40 per cent more likely now to cheat on their husbands than in 1990, says best-selling author, Wednesday Martin. She adds that it appears rising numbers of women are prepared to act on their thoughts of other men, despite being in marriages. Wednesday, whose new book \u0027Untrue\u0027 is out this month, came across a number of real women’s voices and stories when carrying out research.   In a piece for the Daily Mail , she describes how one woman, called Erica, didn\u0027t want to give up on her marriage when the passion disappeared.  Instead, after years of sexual disappointment, the 46-year-old went online to search for someone - and ended up having a passionate affair. Wednesday says the women she encountered had ying problems, from \u0027routine\u0027 sex that didn\u0027t fulfil them, to no intimacy, to a craving for novelty. Crucially, none of these women wanted to give up on their marriages or loved their husbands any less, explains the author. While male infidelity used to be at a much higher rate than female infidelity, experts believe the gap is increasingly narrowing. One reason is that more women are out at work, where they are apart from their partners and exposed to potential lovers, some experts say. Another reason could be technology - with women able to discreetly have affairs through social media and apps, according to Wednesday.  And some believe women in long-term relationships are just as likely to lose interest in their other halves over time as men are. Wednesday says that what she has discovered through research is that women’s libidos are far stronger and more adventurous than we thought. Her research included speaking to women of a range of ages, as well as investigating scientic and evolutionary theories. In her Mail article, she says some scientists believe women get bored of sleeping with the same man, and desire others, for evolutionary reasons. They need new experiences to stay interested, according to these scientists. According to Wednesday\u0027s book, female infidelity is now far from uncommon. In it, the author writes: Women lust and women cheat. And it sets us aflame.

The dramatic aerial image gives a stark illustration of the immense clear-up job facing the authorities in Indonesia, as emergency workers comb through the wreckage in a desperate search for survivors. Many people were trapped under fallen masonry and rubble from the earthquake before the tsunami struck. Resident Nur Indah said: “The ground rose up like a spine and suddenly fell. People were trapped and buried under collapsed houses. I could do nothing to help.”  Today – four days after the 20ft high wave surged through the city on Friday – Indonesian soldiers began digging a 300ft long trench as a mass grave for the hundreds of dead. So far, 840 people living in the city of more than 300,000 people are confirmed to have been killed, but that figure is expected to climb steeply in the coming days. Army commander Tiopan Aritonang said 545 bodies for the grave would be brought from one hospital alone. Willem Rampangilei, chief of Indonesia’s National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said: “This must be done as soon as possible for health and religious reasons.” As a majority Muslim country, burials are supposed to take place within one day in Indonesia. There are also fears that without immediate burial of the dead, disease could spread quickly among the tens of thousands made homeless. The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in the early evening, at the top of the narrow bay in which Palu is situated.  Britain sent a team of five specialist aid workers to assist the relief effort. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said: “Following a request from the Government of Indonesia... we are deploying a team of UK aid humanitarian advisers to the region, who will use their disaster response expertise to help co-ordinate efforts on the ground. “I have made an initial \u0026pound2million of UK aid support available to help meet the immediate needs of the most vulnerable people.” Two survivors were pulled from the 80-room Hotel Roa Roa and there are hopes more could be alive after calls for help were heard.

Residents in Kozino village near Moscow, Russia say the puma was the pet of a local oligarch in a nearby elite housing compound Fryaz, home to many Russian celebrities. The male cat escaped and terrorised homes in Kozino in the early morning attack. It spent an hour and a half in local man Alexey Mirankov’s garden before the emergencies services shot the beast with a tranquilliser. Incredibly, the dog called Zhulya survived its ordeal - as it  the puma was toying with it rather than intending to feast on it.  “I heard my dogs yelping,” he said.   “When I went out, I saw a puma holding one of them in its teeth,” said the shocked householder. “I felt lost at first. “I immediately thought of my daughter aged five who is usually walking outside at this time - but thankfully she was in the house. “When I went back inside, the puma ran after me holding my dog with its teeth.  “It did not let the dog go for about eight minutes. When I got inside the house, I immediately called the emergency services.” The puma had stalked his garden from 6.30am looking for the hiding dogs, he said. “The rescue service came and shot at puma with a tranquilliser. “They said it was a young male who escaped from the elite settlement called Gryaz.

It is hard to defend United manager Csaba Laszlo now and it would be no surprise  he is given his jotters after this most horric of days.It started when eventual hat-trick hero and former Tangerine Billy Mckay opened the scoring from close range on 11 minutes, knocking in a Josh Mullin cross.The only chink of light in the game came six minutes later as Pavol Safranko got on the end of Fraser Aird\u0026#8217s delivery to guide the ball past Scott Fox in the away net.From there United laboured and County took advantage. Scoring the most simple and avoidable goals \u0026#8211 often carbon copies of each other.The second came on 29 minutes after a Jamie Robson mistake played in Mullin to square for Mckay to knock in.On 41 minutes the same problems United had faced all game down their left-hand side were there for all to see as Sean Kelly inswinging free-kick went all the way through past Matej Rakovan in the home net. A horrible goal to concede with no communication evident and the defence at sixes and sevens.Soon after the restart the Staggies put the game to bed when Mullin and Mckay linked up again with the former this time tapping in from a yard out on 50 minutes.Mullin turned provider, once more, two minutes later laying Mckay\u0026#8217s hat-trick on a plate for him and the Northern Irishman gobbled it up from a matter of inches out.Csaba tried to change things for the Tangerines, but by this point the punters had seen enough and were leaving in their droves and calling for his head in the process, as he brought on Stewart Murdoch and Fraser Fyvie to try to change things on 56 minutes.And three minutes later Murdoch summed up the Terrors afternoon as he was shown a straight red for a stamp on Jamie Lindsay.It capped what was United\u0026#8217s worst performance in years as County saw out the rest of the game with little problem.

brought in to ease the problems caused by a shortage of drivers.She said: “National Express has centres in Dundee, the West Midlands and Coventry.“It makes sense for us to use bus drivers from these other centres while we have a shortage in Dundee.“We are doing everything we can to ease the disruption to bus services which we are currently facing.”However, the spokeswoman declined to confirm how many drivers had arrived in the city from south of the border.She added: “We maintain our stance that we are working hard, using what measures we can to resolve the immediate issues.”Last week, the Tele reported that dozens of bus cancellations had occurred in Dundee in the last few weeks, causing inconvenience for local commuters.North East councillor Brian Gordon said that his constituency had been particularly badly hit, with 30 services cut over two days last week.He said: “I welcome the fact that Xplore are doing something to deal with this.“However, there are two issues with the English drivers.“One is that they don’t know the routes in Dundee and they’re not going to learn them overnight.“Secondly,  it is just five drivers then that isn’t enough.“Many bus drivers in Dundee are complaining that they are missing out signicantly on holiday days due to them because of the shortage.“Five extra drivers isn’t going to resolve this.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba happy to be

I would actually say the museum is good value for money  anything.”Just 7% were “not fussed” about the spend while 32% said they would like to have seen the cash invested elsewhere.Reader Mark Petrie said he felt it would be years before the city knows for certain whether it was worth the money while Alison Donald wrote: “Meantime, what is happening to the people of Dundee using foodbanks?”We asked people to rate the V\u0026ampA from one to 10, based on what they’d seen of the museum so far.A total of 179 people – 40% – gave it full marks, with another 11% giving it nine out of 10 and 10% rating it as eight out of 10.Tele reader Dave Alexander wrote: “I love it, for once we have something to be proud of in our city.

They want to have the target of promotion and winning the league.“This is pressure, this is normal but you have to understand we have a budget that isn’t any higher than other teams in the main.“You have to bring a team together. We had 19 players leave and 16 players come in for the new season.“We can’t click our fingers and have the team work fantastically.“There are rules at the club about how many or which kind of players we can bring in within our budget.“It is not easy, we are not Manchester City with an owner behind you who can give you £20 million to go and spend.“We have to work with the budget we have to get the best for the club.“The Dundee United board have done a fantastic job. It is not easy to convince players from abroad to come to the Scottish Championship with everything else around.”It was quite a defence – but probably one that was coming after weeks of trying to keep a lid on it following poor results against Alloa and Morton.Yes, he has not had his troubles to seek with injury and scrutiny from all angles but it seems to be just the beginning for Csaba in his most tough of jobs.In the next four weeks they take on title rivals Ross County, Ayr United, Partick Thistle and Inverness.

Recent figures showed the fund increased in value in 2016-17 by \u0026pound31.1 million. As of last weekend, it was valued at \u0026pound2,013,164,722.61.Addressing colleagues on the audit and scrutiny committee, Cllr MacLean called for a review of investment strategy. She acknowledged the need to secure the best .But she added: \u0026ldquoSome people are not happy with some of the investments and feel that perhaps  it\u0027 invested in tobacco or arms or things like that, it\u0027 not ethically responsible.She asked whether fund trustees had any say in the choice of investments.The council\u0027 investments change on a daily basis.Recent examples of contentious choices include British American Tobacco , liqueurs firm Pernod Ricard , pubs chain Mitchells and Butlers , Japan Tobacco  and China\u0027 second largest brewery, Tsingtao .The council\u0027 finance director Derek Yule explained that an investments sub-committee reports to a pension board which sets the strategy.\u0026ldquoIt is very dficult when some of the investment strategy seeks to invest in shares in companies not just in the UK but worldwide, he said.\u0026ldquoWhilst I totally understand some of the ethical debate, it is very dficult to draw a line sometimes.\u0026ldquoYou might take a view\u0026hellip would you invest in banks, for example? They might not be the best investment, anyway. But I use that as an example because banks will fund these companies.\u0026ldquoIt\u0027 a dficult balancing act but it\u0027 certainly within your rights  you wished the pension board to look at the investment strategy.\u0026ldquoFund managers are given guidelines to work to, so that would be quite legitimate for the council to do through the pension board.According to current policy, the fund \u0026ldquorecognises that social, environmental and ethical considerations are among factors investment managers will take into account, where relevant, when selecting investments for purchase, retention or sale.However, it stresses that \u0026ldquothe overriding consideration for pension committee members is their fiduciary duty to the scheme employers and scheme members.The Scheme Advisory Board, established up by the Scottish Government to regulate such public sector pension funds, recently obtained advice from legal counsel on the duty of pensions committees.The guidance concluded that: \u0026ldquoPensions committees in Scotland owe a fiduciary duty to the scheme employers and the scheme members in general and specically in relation to investment matters.\u0026ldquoThose duties should be exercised in the best interests of the beneficiaries and in relation to investment decisions, should aim to achieve the best financial position for the fund, balancing risk and  in the usual way.Tuesday 2 Oct 2018 3:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117654.jpg","title":"Response to Charlie tale stuns cat owner","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMarie MacIver, who lives in Hilton and relies on disability benefit, lives alone with her five-year-old cat Charlie.She got in touch with the Courier after it became apparent that Charlie\u0027 injured leg needed an X-ray, which she could not afford.She had already contacted animal welfare charities without success.After we printed the story last week, we were inundated with offers of help for little Charlie \u0026ndash and Mrs MacIver admitted she was moved to tears.\u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know what I would have done without everyone who offered to help, she said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove been in tears because people have been so nice.

behind the plans was given the green light in May to seek a lease for the land at Bellfield Park by the Marr Area Committee.Due to the nature of the land, Banchory Skatepark Group  would need to gain a lease from a sherf before starting to build.BSG was tasked with producing a feasibility study as part of the application to the sherf.Russ Crichton, chairman of the BSG, said: “The feasibility study covered many areas but of particular interest was the community consultation.“The consultation threw up a fantastic result and very supportive comments.“Overall there were 531 responses with 99.3% support to a new skate park in Banchory.“We are now completing the specication to issue out to Public Contracts Scotland to gather bids for the new skate park.“We are also continuing to develop the design and preparation for our planning application which will take place in the next few weeks.”The consultation asked respondents 17 questions about the skate park, covering topics from the local need for the development to the possibility of a fee being charged for use.If the fee were to be introduced, the report says, it may only be applicable at night, and will primarily be used to fund a “pay as you go” floodlight system.Respondents decided £3 per hour was a fair price to charge for the lighting.Almost three-quarters  of respondents said that floodlighting should be part of the facility.The cost of the project is estimated at £240,000, 25% of which will be matched by the Banchory Developers Fund.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"work on revamp of aberdeens union terrace gardens

contractor for the multi-million-pound revamp of the Victorian gardens and is accepting bids to carry out the work until later in the month.Douglas Lumsden, co-leader of the local authority, has not been able to give assurances the work – due to be completed in 2020 – will kick off this year, but has said it “hopes” to appoint a contractor by the end of the year.SNP group leader Stephen Flynn has raised concerns over perceived delays to the work.He said: “We’re all well aware that Union Terrace Gardens is behind schedule and the key thing at this stage is the administration ensure their revised timetable is kept to.“We can’t afford any further slippage.\u0026#8221Construction has yet to start, but without a spade yet hitting the ground it is feared it may be impossible for the ambitious project to be completed within the estimated 18- to 24-month timeframe.Mr Lumsden said: “We’ve made it clear that we’re in the tender process just now and it’s just typical of the opposition trying to talk the city down when they should be getting behind the projects we’re putting in place.”A number of high-profile council projects have been delayed in recent years, including revamps of Broad Street, the art gallery, Provost Skene’s House and the Central Library.London Olympic Park architects LDA Design won planning permission for its Union Terrace Gardens plan in March.The proposals include new walkways, an amphitheatre and a cafe.They aim to conserve the Victorian park’s heritage and to “sustain Aberdeen’s performance in times of economic dficulty”, according to a design statement.Other features of the scheme include a new accessible walkway route into the gardens from Union Street.Lt access from Union Street into the upper level of the gardens will also be provided through a new entrance building on Union Terrace at the existing Burns Monument.The central lawn space would be retained as a flexible space for large-scale gatherings and events and there would be a new entrance opposite His Majesty’s Theatre.The plans mark the latest development in the future of the city park. Councillors rejected proposals for a £140 million transformation of the gardens in 2012.Businessman Sir Ian Wood had offered £50m towards the cost and earlier this year claimed it was a “tragedy” Aberdeen City Council decided to reject his multi-million-pound plan for the renovation of the gardens.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"gap should be broader to win two in borders","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen Grammar came within two minutes of a Border double at Selkirk, only to have the game cruelly snatched away from them.Home flanker Sean Nixon crashed over the Rubislaw outfit’s line to tie up the scores at 26 points apiece.Worse was to come for the visitors when winger Frazer Anderson slotted the touchline conversion, making it a perfect day for the player who kicked all of his four attempts at goal in the last-gasp 28-26 win.Grammar head coach Ali O’Connor was understandably gutted at the conclusion of a game his side had controlled for most of the 80 minutes.They went into the last quarter leading 26-7 on the back of four tries, scored by stand-off Sam Knudson, flanker Alex Dravitski, scrum-half Cairan Wood and winger Nat Coe.O’Connor said: “It was hard to take, particularly as we had the lion’s share of the game, and dominated up front.“Normally I would be happy to have taken seven points of a possible 10 against two Border sides, including Kelso last week.“But we must learn to close out games, and not be too flamboyant going into the closing stages of a game we have seemingly won.“There were, however, some outstanding performances, including first-rate showings from Ewan Stewart, Chris Jollands and captain Sam Knudson.”Playing into a stf first-half breeze, Grammar did not make the best of the conditions, only taking a 12-7 lead into the break.But early in the second half two well-taken tries, both converted by Knudson, saw them apparently on their way.But the Borderers had other ideas, battling back with touchdowns of their own to snatch an unlikely victory.In Glasgow, Gordonians kept up their unbeaten run, easing past Hillhead Jordanhill 25-17 to the satisfaction of head coach Ryan Morrice.He said: “This is the kind of game we would have lost last season, but we have learned how to keep our composure and stick to the game plan.“The win has set us up nicely for a tilt at leaders Newton Stewart at Countesswells. The try bonus point was very welcome. We are in a good place.”The Gordonians tries were scored by Matt Hillier, Danny Usugo, David Ilyine and Chris Simpson.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op.32 No.12 as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer?Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse/harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills 2,000 years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead \u0026#8211 now wasted \u0026#8211 would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year\u0026#8217s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall \u0026#8211 this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £700 at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers \u0026#8211 Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £915.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior/1st male \u0026#8211 Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: 1:10:40Female Senior/1st female –Lucy Fraser 1:15:05Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club 1:17:55Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club 1:10.19.42Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – 1:12:48Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club 1:23:34Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – 1:19:30Female Vintage  – Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club 1:38:22Male Super Vintage  – Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club 1:25:001st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend 1:19:441st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin 1:16:28The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of 1 hour 12 minutes and 56 seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage category  put in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage 70+ age group and won by over 20 minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the 12-mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage race  Alan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at 8 minutes and 9 seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the 40+ veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by 20 seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of 25 minutes 33 seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a 31 minute 7 second run being 10 seconds quicker then Phil Dye and 30 seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteran  female category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veteran  category saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of 1:16:28, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at 1:20:51 and Iain MacNicol in third place 1:23:56. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at 1:19:44, in second place was Sarah Grfin at 1:21:33 and Louise Gibson at 1:25:34 in third place.\u0026nbspTeam EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were 13 teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of 7 minutes 52 seconds, followed only 20 seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only 20 seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction 4.0, ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘40 Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.\u0026nbspThanks, and Feedback\u0026nbspMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

There was something for that Orange is the New Black fan, some Riverdale-style Serpent jackets spotted, and the 80s horror genre is still alive and well, ironically.This year\u0026#8217s convention featured a lot of zombies in costume and in the events.

You want a cupcake that looks like Cookie Monster? An original graphic novel? A Spider-Man bathbomb? You\u0026#8217ll find it.The passion for the arts is the main draw though. Whether you\u0026#8217re taking the inspiration past comic cons and culture has given to make that perfect costume, a new novel, or a piece of memorabilia, the dedication and passion shines through as much as in Van Gogh\u0026#8217s Starry Night.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a busy time at tarbert golf club","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/09/18, 9:32 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt was a busy weekend at Glenralloch, home of Tarbert Golf Club, with several finals taking place and the rescheduled James Johnson Cup.Despite horrendous rainfall during the week the course was in excellent condition for the end of season James Johnson Cup.

For someone with autism, it must surely engender anxiety beyond anything others could imagine.Dean\u0026#8217s presentation at Arrochar\u0026#8217s Three Villages Hall was entitled \u0026#8216Aspergers, anxiety and me\u0026#8217. And it was all about being positive while living with autism.He makes a living touring the world talking about and spreading understanding of autism, but opened in Arrochar by making it clear that he does not claim to represent every autistic person.His attitude is: \u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m going to be autistic until my dying breath, so I\u0026#8217m going to be positive.\u0026#8217Dean went on: \u0026#8216We need to identy the challenges and put support in place, but that doesn\u0026#8217t mean we can\u0026#8217t celebrate the dferences \u0026#8211 the skills, the talents and personalities of our fabulous autistic people.\u0026#8217This year is the 20th anniversary of Dean\u0026#8217s diagnosis of autism and at the beginning, by his own admission, he did not take it well.\u0026#8216I thought friendships, a career, relationships were all out of reach for me because I was on the autistic spectrum.\u0026#8217There followed a gradual acceptance of his condition \u0026#8211 helped, he joked, by online dating  and a realisation that autism is something to be celebrated.Anxiety, though, is an ever-present for Dean. \u0026#8216Research tells us that anxiety is much more of an issue for autistics than the general population,\u0026#8217 he said.Offering some personal tips, he suggested \u0026#8216saying less, but with maximum meaning\u0026#8217 to an autistic person experiencing anxiety. And to stay calm.There are bonuses to being autistic, as Dean outlined. \u0026#8216Nobody experiences joy like an autistic. Most people will never get to that level of happiness and wellbeing.\u0026#8217He ended with a tale from his past. \u0026#8216At the age of seven, I was told that by the age of 30 I\u0026#8217d be in prison. I was suspended more times than you could count. I was made to feel I would need to work to overcome autism.\u0026#8216In the second half of my le, so far I have done lecturing, spoken all over the world, I\u0026#8217m a singer, I do a lot of things. And I came to realise that this was not despite being autistic \u0026#8211 it was because of it.\u0026#8217He concluded: \u0026#8216Autism is not about a list of deficits or deficiencies \u0026#8211 it\u0026#8217s a list of dferences, and dference is good.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"council lack of help blasted after lifeline phone peril","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/09/18, 5:52 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowStorm Ali may not have brought the devastation predicted in some quarters, but it did bring down some trees and branches around Mid Argyll.And it left one elderly Lochgilphead couple perilously close to having their leline telecare service cut off on the morning of Wednesday September 19.When a small tree fell from neighbouring land into the garden of Noreen Harvey, it was left resting on the phone line into her home \u0026#8211 which itself was supported by her washing line held up by a clothes pole.Afraid the line would break, 80-year-old Mrs Harvey called Argyll and Bute Council for help shortly after 9am the same day.It wasn\u0026#8217t until the next day , when she called the council again, that she says she was told someone had been out to have a look and it was deemed that the tree had been growing in a private garden, so was nothing to do with the council.Mrs Harvey was left angry at the treatment she received.\u0026#8216The phone line is very important for me and my husband, who is 84, and we rely on it,\u0026#8217 she said. \u0026#8216And the tree wasn\u0026#8217t in a private garden, it was growing in housing association land at the back of my house.

Jake Speirs and Olivia Ferguson from Ayr have made it through intense auditions to compete in the dance contest in aid of STV Children’s Appeal. The 10-year-olds ranked in the top 46 out of a whopping 600 youngsters across the country. And the dance duo had never met, let alone danced together, when they were paired up. Now the movers will take on the cha-cha – a dance neither of them have done before. Olivia, who attends Alloway Primary said: “My mum saw it on Facebook and said to me ‘Olivia do you want to go for this, it’ll be a good opportunity,’ so then I applied. “You sent a clip in of you dancing and  they liked it you got invited for an audition.  “Then we got an email saying ‘come to the second audition’ but it wasn’t a second audition, it was to tell us on camera that we had got into the finals. “We went to a master-class day with all the kids who got through to see what style you’re best at. So there was salsa, cha-cha and others – and then they partnered you with someone and told you at the end of the day what style you’d be doing. “So we had no idea about who we’d be dancing with or what style.” Olivia has been dancing since she was a tot, initially Highland but now specialising in lyrical. And P7 St John’s pupil Jake only started dancing two years ago but has now competed across the country in his freestyle dancing. Recalling being told they had got through to the finals, the pair said they couldn’t believe it. Olivia said: “I felt quite overwhelmed because I wasn’t expecting it.”  Jake added: “Everybody went all silent.” Wannabe dance teacher Jake said winning would mean “a lot”. He said: “Mum would be mega proud.” Olivia added: “It would be amazing.” Rehearsals are well underway for the grand final on November 25 when the duo will take to the floor at the Crowne Plaza in Glasgow in front of 500 people and a panel of guest judges. And the youngsters only have 15 seconds left to learn of their 90-second dance. The cha-cha couple will also be fundraising to raise more monies for the charity. Good luck Jake and Olivia – and keep dancing!

When a local authority starts “mandatory training” of its own councillors in bid to stop embarrassing leaks – you know right away that you’ve got a council with a lot to be embarrassed about! Yes, I know, it’s hard to believe that South Ayrshire Council could actually be embarrassed at all. After some of the strokes this lot have pulled, you couldn’t give them a red face with a blow torch. But it would be interesting to know how many other Scottish councils have called in professional legal tutors to train councillors on their own code of conduct. I don’t know the answer – but I’m guessing it’s another sensational ground-breaking first for go-ahead South Ayrshire! Just like turkeys don’t vote for Christmas, neither do councillors vote for anything that remotely resembles extra work. No, this one has come all the way from the very top where uncomfortable leaks insinuate a lack of total control. Of course, a lack of control can quickly lead to losing control. And “losing control” isn’t a phrase you want to use anywhere near South Ayshire’s chief executive, Eileen Howat.  Earlier this year, Ms Howat  reshuffled the SAC management pack – she discarded a few knaves and dealt herself all the aces.  Now, having sorted out the enemy within, she can focus on the only major threat to her imperious reign – that pesky Ayrshire Post and their constant supply of damaging leaks. The Post, as always, is independent and immovable. All that’s left for Ms Howat is to turn off the leaks at source – not just at any cost – but at all costs. And one of those costs will inevitably be the democratic process and the freedom of the press, or, in her own words: “the issue is information getting out before decisions are made by this council”. Hold on a second, I want to make sure I was reading that properly. “THE ISSUE IS INFORMATION GETTING OUR BEFORE DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THIS COUNCIL.” Call me old fashioned, Ms Howat, but information getting out before a decision is taken is what local government in meant to be all about. In fact, its what any democratic government is about! And  I want to live in a place where information is withheld until a decision is made – I’ll move to North Korea! I know some councillors are still a little unsure of the concept – but they were elected to represent the public. Inform – consult – listen ... and then vote. To help the really thick ones, they put a little reminder on the wall of the council chambers. It says “Ne’e r forget the people”. Perhaps Ms Howat should ask for it to be changed – maybe “Ne’er inform the people” would be more appropriate for the style of local government she has in mind. I don’t know what SAC hope to achieve with all this – but sending councillors to “even walls have ears” class isn’t going to work.

The latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park. Three holes were originally proposed. So far the council has agreed in principle for it to be located at Belleisle and encroach on the Old Racecourse. The council is considering creating a pitch at Rozelle park to replace the lost playing field at the Old Racecourse. Another pitch would be made available at the new Queen Margaret’s Academy school. The development progress of the golf academy was presented to councillors at the South Ayrshire Council Leadership Panel this week . Depute council leader Brian McGinley, of Labour, said: “This is another step along the journey. “We support this because we realise golf is important for the people of South Ayrshire. We want to encourage young people to take up the sport of golf.” Claire Monaghan, council head of community services and facilities, told the Leadership Panel: “ A lot of working is going on to pull all the strands together.” The politicians agreed the Ayrshire Golf Trust, which is spearheading the venture, could go ahead and apply for funding. She said there is a risk funds may be unavailable  there is a delay in applying. So far the The Ayrshire Golf Trust has consulted with local golf clubs, the public and residents. The latest proposed plans are on display at Belleisle Golf Club.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"green-fingered-volunteers-get-gardening-gongs-in-melrose","story":"THE annual Melrose in Bloom awards have been presented.\nHeld at the Ormiston Institute last week, the group\u0026rsquos chairwoman Val Miller handed out a number of top gardening prizes to locals.\nPippa Coles, Abbotsford Gardens and estates development manger, adjudged the Station Hotel to have the \u0026lsquoBest Hotel Floral Display\u0026rsquo and Melrose caravan site to have created the \u0026lsquoBest Other Business Display\u0026rsquo.\nMeanwhile John and Ann Dick picked up the \u0026lsquoBest Private Garden\u0026rsquo accolade.

This is simply not good enough and the SNP\u0026rsquos failure to deliver is holding Scottish businesses back and is unfair for consumers.\nThe report shows around a quarter of those in rural areas, such as the Borders, still cannot get speeds of 10mbps or more.\nThe European Union\u0026rsquos definition of superfast internet, which the Scottish Government has adopted, is 30mbps.\nBut local MSP Christine Grahame  said there were positives to highlight: \u0026ldquoBroadband access is in fact a matter reserved to the Tory UK Government, however  it hadn\u0026rsquot been for the intervention of the Scottish Government, the percentage of premises connected to fibre broadband in the Borders would be 39.3 per cent, rather than the current 91.4 per cent.\n\u0026ldquoThis report recognises that the roll out won\u0026rsquot be easy to deliver, but that is why this SNP Government has matched its ambition for broadband with \u0026pound600 million of investment \u0026ndash the biggest public investment ever made in a UK broadband project.\n\u0026ldquoI would highlight that the report also praises the Scottish Government for exceeding its target of 95 per cent fibre broadband coverage across Scotland by the end of 2017.\n\u0026ldquoAnd that, due to higher than expected take-up and lower than expected costs, the programme will in fact reach 60,300 more premises than planned \u0026ndash at no extra cost to the public sector.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos absolutely disgraceful that, despite being a reserved matter, the UK Government\u0026rsquos funding contribution to R100 is just three per cent of the total \u0026ndash perhaps Mr Lamont should focus on putting pressure on his colleagues in the Tory UK Government to step up to the plate and better support

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.  She interviews the recruits, who, after initial training, get to \u0026lsquoshadow\u0026rsquo a general adviser before going it alone with support from the session supervisor.  Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is interesting and is good  you can be of some use to people.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom at the CAB for half a day twice a week.

She said: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only one on Jenner\u0026rsquos turf.  \u0026ldquoI think that will be a wee bit special.  Already the family have completed three events, with Elaine, 33, running the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen in May. Then Elaine lined up alongside Clare, 32, Kara, 29, Duncan, 28, and Susan for the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, in July.  The youngest members of the squad did their bit at the parkrun in Portrush, Northern Ireland, with Susan joined by Laura, 37, eight-year-old Isla, 14-year-old Ciara and Elaine.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI think we have all found it emotional \u0026ndash just when you are standing on the start line waiting and we have had the odd laugh on the way round when something has happened.  \u0026ldquoIn Aberdeen we thought it was going to pour with rain and the forecast was dreadful. It rained a bit and then went off and we said it was Jenner sorting that out for us.  Now the runners are in the home straight and each of them has been overwhelmed by the generosity of members of the public.  Initially a fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 was set before that was increased to \u0026pound3,000, but both figures have been smashed.  Susan added: \u0026ldquoI think the challenge itself was original and caught people\u0026rsquos imagination but the total is not because of us.  \u0026ldquoIt is a reflection of what Jenner was to so many people.

The plan is a step closer after being awarded \u0026pound8,640 from the Scottish Land Fund.  Sustaining Dunbar claims the project could add \u0026pound800,000 a year to the local economy.  Osbert Lancaster, development officer, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThe building has been standing empty for some time.  \u0026ldquoUntil we know the full condition of the building and cost of remedial work and refurbishment, we don\u0026rsquot know  the project will be financially viable.

Yard of Ale was originally formed in 1972 when Ian Lawson, Alistair McDougald and Colin Mackenzie all found themselves in Musselburgh.  Alistair and Colin had married local girls and Ian had taken up a post in youth and community education. He also later married a Musselburgh girl.  All three had dabbled in folk music in the past and regularly went to the Golf Tavern in Millhill, Musselburgh, to hear local folk singers, the Amulree Trio, Chris Egan and his daughters, Lorraine and Karen.  Alistair explained: \"We each would sing a few songs inidually in the trio\u0026rsquos break. One week John Gillan, the owner of the pub, asked  we could try and fill a night when the Amulrees were unavailable.  \"We had a practice, everything just clicked and Yard Of Ale was born. We played every Friday and Saturday at the Golf for three years and took our name from the yard glass which hung on the wall. We were encouraged by local comedian, Billy Nimmo , to try our hand in the club cabaret scene.\"  Yard Of Ale then had many successful years on the pub and club circuit, winning the TV Times \u0027Pub Entertainers of the Year\u0027 award. The band did well on ITV\u0027s \u0027New Faces\u0027 and appeared on many television and radio shows including STV\u0026rsquos \u0027Thingummyjig\u0027 and BBC Radio Scotland\u0026rsquos \u0027Scottish Radio Orchestra Roadshow.\u0027 During this time they also supported, amongst others, Matt McGinn, Hamish Imlach and Billy Connolly, and enjoyed an extended run in the Edinburgh Festival with the legendary Tim Hardin.  They then went their separate ways with Alistair involved in solo cabaret work, Colin playing with the North Sea Gas folk group and Iain, the original guitarist, leading a rock band.  In 1992 the group reformed for a charity show at the Brunton Theatre with good friends The Mimics, a successful Musselburgh comedy showband who had also broken up previously, to mark the passing of their mentor Billy Nimmo. The event was so successful that the band decided to give it another go.  Since then its popularity has continued to grow and it has been in great demand for concerts, folk festivals, corporate s, pub, hotel and club gigs all over Scotland and when on tour in Denmark and in Ireland.  Peter Gillan, nephew of the Golf\u0026rsquos John Gillan, then joined the band when Ian retired in 1998. Having spent many years playing solo as a singer and guitarist on the folk and country scenes, his experience added yet another dimension to the band.  Walter Mowat joined Yard Of Ale in 2015 when Colin retired. Over the years he has played in a number of folk and bluegrass bands and also plays violin in the Really Terrible Orchestra.  Ian and Colin still occasionally feature with the band as deputies or for larger concerts.  Alistair and Ian each have two sons who were brought up and educated in Musselburgh.  Alistair\u0026rsquos sons were both taught at the Burgh School by Susan Macintosh, Peter\u0026rsquos we.  Peter started his working le at Brunton\u0026rsquos Wiremill and still works for Brunton Aero products as it is now.

Rhona said: \u0026ldquoI think as well as getting the donations throughout, it really did spur me on knowing I was doing something in memory of my gran.  \u0026ldquoSo many other people were doing the same challenge and being part of something bigger really helped.  \u0026ldquoThere were a lot of days where I did not want to go out for a run, especially in the heatwave.  \u0026ldquoIt was quite hard some days to keep going.  According to Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK, more than 1,700 people across the county have been diagnosed with dementia, with that figure expected to double within the next 20 years.  University student Rhona previously told the Courier she was not a keen athlete but found she had come on leaps and bounds during the challenge, which she finished at the end of August.  She said: \u0026ldquoI really improved.  \u0026ldquoI think for the first month, the improvement was so slow and I was pretty worried but one of my last runs was an eight-kilometre run.  \u0026ldquoI could only run about a tenth of that in the beginning.  \u0026ldquoOnce I got over that hump, it was crazy \u0026ndash I was adding a kilometre every week to my personal best.  \u0026ldquoFor me, time did not really matter.  \u0026ldquoIt kind of came naturally and when I did shorter runs I was noticing I was getting a lot quicker but for me it was really about getting the distances since it seemed so unreachable for me in the beginning.  Rhona got involved with Dementia Friendly Haddington when she was still at Knox Academy.  She co-organised an event with fellow Knox pupil Kate Farmer at Haddington Day Centre, which saw an entire music class provide entertainment.  Since then, she has done her bit for dementia and Alzheimer-related charities, raising \u0026pound546 through the challenge, and has not ruled out lacing up her running shoes again in the future after finding it not only improved her fitness but her mental health too.  Speaking on Friday morning, the fourth year studying film at Edinburgh Napier University added: \u0026ldquoGenuinely, the reason I missed your call was I was about to go for a run.  \u0026ldquoThat would be my first since I finished the challenge.  \"I took a week off, I think I earned a week off but I am going to try to keep it up.  \u0026ldquoI expected to get fitter but did not really expect how much of an impact it would have on my mood.  \u0026ldquoJust genuinely you go for a run and there is no way you are going to feel bad afterwards.

Mrs Paul said: \"We have offered to fundraise with you and help manage the project and we\u0027d be delighted to do that.\"  Ms Cowie thanked them for their offer.  However, Mrs Paul also said the run-down shelter remained a problem.  \"It is 20 feet from our bedroom window and recently there\u0027s been homeless people sleeping in it.  \"It still needs sorted out.\"  Mr and Mrs Paul have previously said they\u0027d like the shelter knocked down.

In the past seven years, Mrs O\u0026rsquoKeefe and her team have been responsible for securing \u0026pound4.5 million in grants from trust funds and donations from generous members of the public, as well as support from the Scottish Government.  This has enabled the charity to deliver more than 33,000 respite nights since setting up as an independent charity.  In 2017, Leuchie House supported people with more than 35 dferent conditions to benefit from short breaks with 24-hour care.  The North Berwick resident, who will be leaving in November, said: \u0026ldquoEveryone who knows me knows how passionate I am about Leuchie House and the very special service we provide.  \u0026ldquoIt was always going to be dficult to step down, but I know I can do so feeling proud of everything we\u0026rsquove achieved.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove been honoured to experience on a daily basis just how much of a dference Leuchie makes to all the hundreds of families we support every year.  \u0026ldquoI would like to say a huge thank you to my team \u0026ndash staff and volunteers \u0026ndash for all their support and commitment.

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.  But what was troubling them more was the \u0026ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.  The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.  But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.  They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death?  It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.  It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.  Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents? Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.  Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, for  it had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.  They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in 1603 which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.  It was written into statue by an act in 1609.  The Act called on all \u0026ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and \u0026ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .  And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.  When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.  It said there was a need to set an example to \u0026ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.  It continued: \u0026ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children \u0026ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.  The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be \u0026ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.  They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.  They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in 1624. They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living \u0026ldquoas  they were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be \u0026ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.  The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of 1609 was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other \u0026ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.  Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.  And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.  Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.  The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.  But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.  In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy/traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared \u0026ldquonon-settled lestyle.  But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.  They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didn\u0026rsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.  I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about \u0026lsquoTinks\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoGypos\u0026rsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.  The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not \u0026ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.  It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud \u0026ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.  It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the 1609 Act and made my spine shiver.  I didn\u0026rsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.  I\u0026rsquom ashamed about that \u0026ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"  The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

It follows a successful bid to attract volunteers to join the community project which is expected to take two years to complete.  Andrew Crummy, the artist behind the Great Tapestry of Scotland and Battle of Prestonpans Tapestry, spoke at a recent event in the Old Town Hall as did Melissa Viguier from the School of Ancient Crafts.  The Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, which took place between Wallyford, Musselburgh and Dalkeith on September 10, 1547, has been described as the largest and bloodiest conflict ever fought on Scottish soil.  It began after the English king Henry VIII\u0026rsquos attempts to secure an alliance with Scotland through the marriage of his young son Edward to the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, failed.  Part of a conflict known as the Rough Wooing, it is considered to be the first modern battle in the British Isles and a catastrophic defeat for Scotland.  Now the Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group is working with Mr Crummy to make sure the last pitched battle between Scottish and English armies, in which 10,000 were killed, is not forgotten.  The tapestry will be loosely based on the Marian Hangings stitched by Mary, Queen of Scots. Ms Viguier and a team of Edinburgh stitchers crafted a complete replica of the Marian hangings which can be seen at Edinburgh Castle.  The Battle of Pinkie Cleugh tapestry will take the form of a series of embroideries hung on velvet which, it is hoped, will find a permanent home at The Brunton in Musselburgh.  The Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group has already secured \u0026pound10,000 from the Musselburgh Common Good Fund, which will pay for the first phase of the tapestry. Chief stitcher Liz Neilson and her team will lead the work.  Volunteer stitchers are welcome to attend future workshops at the Old Town Hall from 10am to 1pm on October 13 and 27, November 10 and December 8.  Alister Hadden, treasurer of the Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group, said: \"We were delighted with how well attended the launch event was. It is really good to see so much work being done and we are sure the tapestry will be a huge success, and highlight this important battle.\""},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-resident-greatly-honoured-at-becoming-bha-chairman","story":"  Atholl Duncan will take over from incumbent Steve Harman when he steps down on November 12.

Solar panels have been fitted to generate electricity, helping cut tenants\u0026rsquo fuel bills.  The new development, part-funded by a \u0026pound2.4m grant from the Scottish Government, is part of a project to build 1,500 new homes, a new primary and secondary school, open spaces and sports facilities in Wallyford.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos housing spokesman, said: \u0026ldquoMeeting tenants and seeing how happy and settled they already are in their fantastic new homes was a real privilege.  \u0026ldquoOf course, ensuring that our residents have access to high-quality social housing is a key aim for East Lothian Council and it\u0026rsquos essential that we work with organisations like Dunedin Canmore to deliver this.  \u0026ldquoBut it also goes wider than that and this regeneration of Wallyford is all about building strong communities.  \u0026ldquoTo that end, the council has been invested in ensuring that all of our new tenants will have great access to shops, facilities and new schools.  \u0026ldquoIndeed, construction of the new primary school on this site is already well advanced.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian is a popular place to live and, as a council, we are continually working to make sure we develop and enrich strong and vibrant communities.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure our new tenants here in Wallyford will very much enjoy their new homes and the community that surrounds them.  Mr Goodfellow was joined at the official opening by some of the new residents, staff from Dunedin Canmore and its parent company Wheatley Group, local elected members and representatives from Scottish Government, East Lothian Council and contractor Hart Builders, part of the Cruden Group.  Tenant Angela Coyle moved into her new house with her young family at the end of March.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe had lived in Wallyford for years but got moved to temporary accommodation in Tranent last year when our landlord sold our home.  \u0026ldquoWe really wanted to come back as we love the area.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a community feel to the place and everybody is getting on.

Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said: \u0026ldquoThis is a very exciting project for Wallyford and I\u0026rsquom pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to co-fund the project with \u0026pound2.4 million investment, giving more people access to high quality social rented housing with this 44 unit development also including nine amenity homes."},{"url":null,"title":"the-midnight-run-set-for-special-gig-in-macmerry-primary-school","story":"  The Midnight Run band will play at Macmerry Primary School, supported by young musicians from the school.

Now, a giant sponge of mosses has been put in place on High Street, outside the police station, in the hope of cutting nearby pollution by close to a third.  CityTree has been developed by German green technology firm Green City Solutions who say the combination of mosses in the structure can filter air pollutants - including nitrogen dioxide - from the surrounding air by up to 30 per cent.  Derek Oliver of East Lothian Council described the structure as a \"innovative approach\"\u0026nbspto tackling air quality issues.  He added: \"It is anticipated to raise awareness and influence behavioural change around pollution and climate change. We will seek public opinion following the pilot period.  The East Lothian CityTree has been funded by the Scottish Government through the East Central Scotland Vehicle Emissions Partnership and has been installed in the designated Air Quality Management Area of Musselburgh High Street for an initial four-month pilot period.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, cabinet member for environment, added: \u0026ldquoIt is particularly appropriate that we are installing this CityTree at the start of Climate Week Scotland 2018 and it will be interesting to see what impact it will have on air pollution in Musselburgh High Street.  \"A number of measures have been outlined in the Musselburgh Air Quality Action Plan to tackle poor air quality including introducing new technology, aiming to reduce vehicle emissions, and encouraging sustainable travel options.  \"Whether as an inidual, business or school, we can all play a part in taking action to improve our environment and I hope the CityTree will act as a focus for future ideas.  The installation powers itself via solar panels, and rainwater is collected and automatically redistributed using a built-in irrigation system. This provides ideal conditions for the mosses to grow in an urban environment.  East Lothian is the second local authority in Scotland to have a CityTree, following Glasgow City Council.  CityTree technology has also been installed in Berlin, Paris, Brussels, Hong Kong, Amsterdam, Oslo, London and Newcastle."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7806017.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"theresa-may-has-a-duty-to-consider-alternatives-to-chequers-as-brexit-looms","story":"  The Scottish First Minister will argue\u0026nbspthat the \u0026ldquoonly glimmer of hope emerging from the \u0026ldquofiascos of the last few weeks is that Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers deal has been \u0026ldquoexposed as untenable.

This has so far been rejected by the Conservative administration at Westminster.  With the UK\u0026rsquos EU departure date looming, Ms Sturgeon will claim the Chequers deal \u0026ndash which has already been rejected by European leaders \u0026ndash is not a \u0026ldquoserious and credible option.  But by continuing to pursue this Mrs May is \u0026ldquoploughing on with a strategy that she knows will reduce household incomes and cost people their jobs, the First Minister will say.  Ms Sturgeon, speaking as the UK Conservative conference takes place in Birmingham, will add: \u0026ldquoIt is time, at this critical hour, for the Prime Minister to finally face up to reality.  \u0026ldquoThe truth is she has lost control of her party and is facing mutiny in Birmingham.  \u0026ldquoWith so little time left to conclude a Brexit deal, and with so many jobs and livelihoods at stake, this arrogant self-indulgence by the Conservative Party is unforgivable.  The First Minister will add: \u0026ldquoIf I had to pick out a glimmer of hope from the fiascos of the last few weeks it would be this: the very fact that the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos negotiating position has been exposed as untenable, means that membership of the single market and the customs union must now be a stronger political possibility than at any time in the last two years.  \u0026ldquoHowever, time is running out fast and an extension of Article 50 to avoid the clf edge that is looming and allow for common sense to prevail is now a necessity.

However, a Freedom of Information request made by this paper has revealed that only a handful of councils immediately complied with the legislation while a number are still not complying and have no intention of doing so.  Argyll \u0026amp Bute Council, which has so far paid out a total of \u0026pound4.8m to settle claims, has not included pensions in any of its pay outs and does not plan to factor them in when dealing with the 120 outstanding claims against it. Similarly, East Ayrshire, which has paid out \u0026pound862,000 in settlements since April 2015, and East Renfrewshire, which has paid out \u0026pound511,000 in that time, have also failed to rerate the pensions of the affected women.  Fe Council, on the other hand, which paid out \u0026pound11.3m in non-pensionable settlements immediately after the legislation was updated, has included pensions in the \u0026pound36.2m it has paid out since. Fe will also factor in pensions as part of settling the 1,100 outstanding claims against it.  East Dunbartonshire, Falkirk, Highland, West Dunbartonshire and West Lothian have also included pensions in recent settlements and will do so for future ones.  The overall result of the dferent approaches is that some women face being discriminated against for the rest of their lives because of the part of the country they lived and worked in, yet no public body will claim responsibility for ensuring the law is enforced.  The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, for example, said that while inidual councils are aware of the pension regulations, \u0026ldquoit is for each employer to consider the appropriate method of settlement and agree the same with the claimants and their representatives.  Audit Scotland, meanwhile, which audits the SPPA, all 32 local authorities and the 11 pension funds that make up the Local Government Pension Scheme, admitted that it did not consider pensions as part of its 2017 report Equal Pay in Scottish Councils. It has also not included the pensions issue in any of the reports it has issued following the annual audit of each inidual authority.  Noting that there are \u0026ldquohighly complex issues around the implementation of equal pay, a spokesman for the body said it is up to local authorities to \u0026ldquoagree the pensionable elements with claimants as part of any settlement.  Even the SPPA, which forced North Lanarkshire Council to include pensions in its settlements after being asked to intervene in 2016, said it has \u0026ldquono powers under pensions legislation to ensure compliance.  \u0026ldquoCouncils are independent bodies of the Scottish Government so negotiations entered into to settle equal-pay claims are a matter for them, an SPPA spokeswoman said. \u0026ldquoIf dferent agreements have been reached it\u0026rsquos for the councils to have ensured they are appropriate and compliant.  Stefan Cross QC of Action4Equality Scotland, who led the case against North Lanarkshire, said this shows that public bodies are \u0026ldquopassing the buck on the issue and failing to uphold the rights of the women the pensions legislation is designed to protect.  \u0026ldquoThe women are left dangling because none of the authorities will take responsibility for upholding the law, he said.  Peter Hunter of the trade union Unison agreed and said that as some women have been receiving the incorrect pension for over a decade, while others have died without ever receiving what they were entitled to, the Scottish Government should intervene.  \u0026ldquoPay is pensionable and therefore equal-pay settlements are pensionable. All this is crystal clear in the law, rulings and guidance on pensions so non-payment of pension contributions for low-paid women is yet another example,  one were needed, of the fact that public bodies need to wake up, he said.  \u0026ldquoMany councils still don\u0026rsquot pay equally, pension fund administrators are inactive in the face of missing millions and auditors still can\u0026rsquot grasp the cost and risk of systemic inequality.  \u0026ldquoThis is a complete system failure. Government has the power to act and the time for action is long overdue.  Despite this, a Scottish Government spokesman, who did not answer questions relating specically to pensions, reiterated the SPPA\u0026rsquos viewpoint that local as opposed to central government should deal with anything related to equal pay.  \u0026ldquoWe have made clear we believe pay discrimination is unacceptable and that equal pay claims should be settled as quickly as possible, he said.  \u0026ldquoAs such as we would urge councils, in line with their legal obligations as employers, to resolve any outstanding claims.  Equal pay and pensions: The history  THE Equal Pay Act 1970 made it illegal for employers to offer men and women dferent employment terms, but it wasn\u0026rsquot until 1997 that a UK-wide agreement was put in place to ensure all local authorities complied with the legislation.  It then took until 2010 for all Scottish councils to implement the so-called single status agreement, with most paying compensation to female workers who had been discriminated against up to that point.  Despite this, all councils went on to receive further equal-pay claims in relation to single status itself. The issues raised included the fact that bonuses that only male staff had been entitled to were protected under the new scheme while the job evaluation element of single status deemed some roles done mainly by women to be less valuable than those done mostly by men.\u0026nbsp  In both rounds of claims most councils treated their settlements as compensation, meaning they were neither taxable nor pensionable. In 2014 HMRC ordered that practice to stop, stressing that all equal-pay settlements must be treated as arrears of pay, with tax and pension contributions becoming due as a result. The rules of the Scottish Local Government Pension Scheme were updated to clary the point in the same year.  Not all councils complied, however. In North Lanarkshire, affected women took legal action against their local authority in a bid to have their pensions - which are calculated based on salary - increased to the level they would have been at had they not been underpaid.  In 2016 the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Scottish Public Pensions Agency ordered the council to abide by the law. The effect was to increase the amount the affected women had been paid in the years they were making claims for and, as a result, their pension entitlement too.  The SPPA wrote to all public bodies in the wake of the North Lanarkshire case to \u0026ldquoclary the policy intent that a payment of arrears of pay, made in respect of an equal-pay claim, should be treated as pensionable.  Equal pay and pensions: The impact  LIZ Melrose, who is enjoying a late summer holiday in Tenere, is looking forward to retiring at the end of this year after putting in a 25-year sht at North Lanarkshire Council.  Yet while the thought of entering the next phase of her le is an enticing one, Mrs Melrose admits that money will be tight to begin with because she is taking early retirement and so won\u0026rsquot receive the state pension for another two years.  Despite this, thanks to a fight put up by her and fellow North Lanarkshire staff, the home support worker will be almost \u0026pound1,500 a year better off than she expected to be because the equal-pay settlement she received from the council in 2015 has finally been reflected in her pension.  As a result, Mrs Melrose\u0026rsquos retirement income will rise from \u0026pound5,695 to \u0026pound7,133 a year when she clocks off for the final time in December. While the numbers are not huge, when her state entitlement is factored in in two years\u0026rsquo time it will make the dference, Mrs Melrose says, between being able to continue to take holidays in retirement and not.  \u0026ldquoThat \u0026pound1,500 a year is a substantial increase, she says.  A retired care home warden is in a similar position. Having stopped work 11 years ago after 30 years of service, also with North Lanarkshire Council, the 71-year old had been receiving the incorrect pension every month in the intervening period until, three months ago, it was bumped up by 30 per cent.  It has, she says, \u0026ldquomade quite a big dference to her and her husband\u0026rsquos lives. Her husband agrees, noting that the couple no longer has to be quite so \u0026ldquoguarded about what we\u0026rsquore spending and what we\u0026rsquore not spending.  Yet the outcome is bittersweet, with the woman\u0026rsquos husband noting that due to ill health his we is no longer able to fully enjoy the extra money.  \u0026ldquoThis would have made a big dference to us, a substantial dference, but my we\u0026rsquos heath has deteriorated and deteriorated and she can\u0026rsquot go abroad now because she can\u0026rsquot get insurance, he says.  \u0026ldquoWe both worked all our days and were in the habit of going on a Continental holiday every year until her ill health prevented that. [If the correct pension had been paid from the start] we might have been able to have a winter holiday and a summer holiday.  \u0026ldquoWhen you get to our age you are on the downward slope as regards time."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-denies-knowing-about-alex-salmond-allegation-five-years-ago","story":"  It was reported yesterday that Mr Salmond, who is facing claims of sexual harassment, apologised to a woman for a \u0026ldquomisunderstanding in 2013 and that \u0026ldquono action was taken by the Government.  A Government spokesperson said Ms Sturgeon, who was Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos deputy at the time, had not been aware of concerns raised by the woman.  In January, two women accused Mr Salmond of sexual misconduct when he was First Minister, allegations that were investigated by civil servants.  The probe led to the Government handing over the findings last month to Police Scotland, which has since launched its own investigation.  As revealed by the Herald on Sunday, the police probe is examining a twenty-month period spanning March 2013 to November 2014 - the last month of Salmond\u0026rsquos time in office.  Mr Salmond angrily denounced the internal Government probe, describing the procedure and unlawful and unfair. He denies any sexual harassment and is challenging the civil service process by way of a judicial review.  It was claimed yesterday that one of the women who came forward this year had also made the complaint five years ago.  According to the account, the complaint was resolved after the woman accepted Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos apology for the \u0026ldquomisunderstanding, which took place at Bute House in Edinburgh.  The claims were said to raise questions about why civil servants ordered another investigation this year when the issue had been apparently been dealt with.  Scottish Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said:  \"It now appears a complaint was made against Alex Salmond in 2013. If that is true, it contradicts what the public has previously been told about when issues around Mr Salmond\u0027s conduct were first raised, and who dealt with them. It is essential the public is now given a clear timeline of events that have lead to this point, including who knew what - and when.\"  In response to the story, a Scottish Government spokesperson said:  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government received two complaints in January in relation to Alex Salmond. These could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.  \u0026ldquoNo complaints were raised with the then Deputy First Minister about Alex Salmond under the previous process and, as we have said, the first the First Minister became aware of the fact of an investigation was from Alex Salmond in April 2018.  Asked whether Ms Sturgeon had been aware that a female staffer had complained about Mr Salmond\u0027s behaviour in 2013, the spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoNo.  On whether the First Minister was aware that the woman had raised concerns about Mr Salmond\u0027s behaviour, the spokesperson gave the same response.  A spokesperson for Mr Salmond said: \u0026ldquoWe have no comment to make because our Petition for Judicial Review against the Permanent Secretary is now before the Court of Session. We expect it to be called very shortly and we intend to do our talking in court. Our objective is to establish that Scottish Government\u0026rsquos complaints procedure used against Alex is unlawful."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8751583.jpg?type=article-full","title":"revealed-the-leaked-document-which-shows-the-scottish-government-has-gone-back-to-the-drawing-board-on-the-merger-of-railway-policing","story":"  The Herald on Sunday can reveal justice minister Humza Yousaf could be ready to roll back on plans to integrate railway policing with the single Scottish force and may concede that there could instead be an informal arrangement with British Transport Police .  An internal document obtained by the Herald on Sunday reveals there are now three merger options on the table, two of which would see officers working in Scotland still employed by British Transport Police Authority, with the Scottish Police Authority  given oversight. When the plan to devolve railway policing was first mooted, three options were suggested by BTP.  But Yousaf\u0026rsquos predecessor Michael Matheson, who is now transport minister, rejected the first two options and spent three years trying to force a takeover of the work of BTP in Scotland. Matheson and Yousaf swapped jobs in First Minister Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos summer cabinet reshuffle.  A discussion paper marked \u0026ldquoOFFICIAL circulated to key stakeholders this week at a meeting chaired by Scottish Government civil servants shows that three options are now under consideration. Option one is a \u0026ldquonon-statutory governance arrangement involving BTP and the SPA, option two is described as a \u0026ldquostatutory route which would give the SPA \u0026ldquoenhanced accountability, and option three is \u0026ldquofull integration, a policy the Scottish Government pursued when Matheson was justice minister. Option three could take eight years to implement, according to the report.  Rail trade union the Transport Salaried Staffs\u0027 Association , which represents BTP staff in Scotland, said the Scottish Government had performed a \u0026ldquoU-turn and called on Sturgeon to sack Matheson for \u0026ldquoincompetence.  Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur said millions of pounds had been spent on an \u0026ldquounworkable merger and Yousaf should now \u0026ldquojunk the original plan altogether.  The s of BTP in Scotland were due to be absorbed into the national force in April next year but Matheson announced in February that the merger had been postponed, amid concerns about IT and pensions arrangements.  The move followed a scathing report from Scotland\u0027s police watchdog which said no authoritative business case was made for the integration. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland, Derek Penman, said a detailed study of the risks should be undertaken.  Penman praised BTP officers and staff for their professionalism amid uncertainty about their position. BTP has 213 officers, 38 police staff and 26 special officers in Scotland, who are charged with looking after 358 stations and 1700 miles of track.  After Yousaf took over the justice department, he announced he would \u0026ldquore-examine all options for the devolution of railway policing, which was originally recommended by the cross-party Smith Commission in 2014.  A Joint Programme Board  was set up in 2017 to integrate BTP in Scotland into Police Scotland. It is chaired by the Scottish Government and UK government\u0026rsquos Department for Transport , and includes representatives from BTP, the SPA and Police Scotland.  A JPB paper circulated this week set out the three options and said each of them \u0026ldquowill be tested on merit as a standalone solution to deliver devolved accountability and responsibility or as part of a phased approach which may progress to full integration to achieve the desired aim.  The report said the SPA does not currently have the s to deliver railway policing. This echoes an SPA report presented to the body\u0026rsquos finance committee last month which said some services may have to be outsourced, resulting in \u0026ldquosignicant dferences to the actual cost base for Police Scotland in integrating BTP-Scotland.  The JPB report, obtained by the Herald on Sunday, states: \u0026ldquoThe options appraisal will provide an evidence-based comparison, considering strategic fit with recommendations from the Smith Commission benefits case risks/impact to the safe and effective management and operational delivery of railway policing in Scotland and the UK and costs \u0026ndash including value for money and affordability.  The document said the timeframe to \u0026ldquogenerate, capture and test the three options will be just over two months, and the justice minister will update the cabinet in early December, with an update provided to MSPs who sit on the Scottish Parliament\u0026rsquos justice committee by the end of the year.  TSSA leader Manuel Cortes said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s taken three long years for the Scottish Government to finally accept what our members have told it from the outset \u0026ndash that the breakup of BTP and its merger with Police Scotland was unnecessary and unfeasible.  \u0026ldquoIt continues to be unwanted by anyone connected with our railways in Scotland because it puts passengers and our members at peril. Let\u0027s face it, BTP and Police Scotland themselves never wanted it either.  \u0026ldquoThe U-turn is the right thing to do. It\u0027s just a crying shame it\u0027s taken them so long to make it. The paper circulated at the Joint Programme Board earlier this week represents a signicant change of heart away from the entrenched nationalism surrounding the earlier decision by former justice minister Michael Matheson.  Cortes praised Yousaf for \u0026ldquohaving the decency to review the merger and the \u0026ldquopolitical courage to force his party to accept that it made a mistake.  The union leader said BTP staff and officers deserve an apology and \u0026ldquorecompense for the unnecessary amount of stress and anxiety forced upon them by Matheson\u0027s idiotic policy for the last three years.  An impact report by the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research  found that 83 per cent of staff and officers who took part in a survey were unsupportive of the merger. \u0026ldquoThe responses to the online survey demonstrated a deep strain of scepticism, cynicism and opposition towards the integration of BTP s into devolved policing structures, said the report.  Co-author of the SCCJR report Dr Kath Murray welcomed the decision to consider the original options. \u0026ldquoIt suggests a sht away from full integration as an end in its own right, towards an effective devolution arrangement, the criminal justice researcher told the Herald on Sunday. \u0026ldquoRetaining the single specialist service within a devolved accountability structure would allow railway policing in Scotland to be underpinned by principles set by the Scottish Government, build on the respective strengths of the BTP and Police Scotland, and crucially, remove the signicant challenges to date, including the risks to public safety and costs to the public purse.  The TSSA\u0026rsquos Cortes said reasoned arguments made to Matheson about the impact of the merger on staff and officers fell on \u0026ldquodeaf ears. \u0026ldquoHe never once got that safety and crime prevention on our railways is far too important to be treated like a political football, he said.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s why we now have deep reservations about his position as transport secretary. Put simply, nobody in our business trusts the man or has any confidence in him. Yousaf\u0027s decision to overturn the injustice done to transport police staff is an indication of Matheson\u0026rsquos lack of judgement. And frankly, Matheson should be made to resign for his incompetence. It\u0027s inconceivable that he can carry on in the transport brief.  Cortes added: \u0026ldquoWhilst I welcome the Joint Programme Board\u0027s latest thinking, make no mistake, this is also an embarrassing climbdown for the SNP. If they want us to believe they have integrity when it comes to security and transport policy then they don\u0027t just need to sink this dangerous and mindless merger proposal, they need to sack Matheson who has no right to expect trust to be vested in him again.  Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur said: \u0026ldquoWhen alternative, less risky options were put forward the Scottish Government dismissed them in a high-handed fashion, choosing instead to barrel ahead with the abolition of the BTP in Scotland without even bothering to develop a proper business case.  \u0026ldquoThat decision cost millions of pounds, shredded the confidence of staff and took us back to square one. It\u0026rsquos no wonder that officer\u0027s representatives have been so critical of ministers\u0027 handling .  \u0026ldquoFor BTP officers and staff the future remains uncertain. The new justice secretary needs to junk the original plan altogether, given two years of work has shown it to be unworkable, and squarely focus on the other viable options for the future of this service.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoAs the Justice Secretary highlighted to the Justice Committee recently, there is a need to identy interim arrangements that could give effect quickly to the devolution of railway policing, as recommended by the Smith Commission.  \u0026ldquoIn August, the Justice Secretary committed to re-examining all options with Police Scotland, the Scottish Police Authority, the British Transport Police and other partners. This process is currently underway and is being discussed by the Joint Programme Board. An update on the next steps will be provided in due course.    TIMELINE OF AN ATTEMPTED MERGER  Smith Commission published its report on further devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament and railway policing was one of those areas.  British Transport Police sets out three options for future devolution of transport policing in Scotland. The third option \u0026ndash breaking up BTP and amalgamating Scottish operations into Police Scotland \u0026ndash is described as the \u0026ldquomost complex. This option would have implications for employment and pension arrangements, as well as financial and legal liabilities.  Scotland Act 2016 is given royal assent, which passed the recommendations of the Smith Commission into law.  The Scottish Government launched a consultation on option three, the integration of railway policing.  Consultation responses are published, showing \u0026ldquomuch opposition to the policy. \u0026ldquoMany considered that a strong case for integration had not been made, said the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos executive summary.  A survey of TSSA members found a third would leave BTP in the event of a merger.  The Railway Policing  Act was passed and TSSA launched a petition opposing the merger, which attracted more than 11,000 supporters  The merger, which was due to be implemented in April 2019, was postponed by former justice minister Michael Matheson.  New justice minister Humza Yousaf announces a review which will explore further options.    THE 2015 AND 2018 OPTIONS    Option One  This option is the simplest route to achieve devolution \u0026ndash that is, through administrative means, rather than legislation.  Option Two  This option consists of a number of measures, both legislative and administrative, to devolve transport policing within Scotland.  Option Three  This is the most complex route to devolution and it would entail breaking up BTP and absorbing its Scottish operations into Police Scotland.    Option 1  Establish a governance arrangement  through BTPA and SPA .  Option 2  Establish a model for SPA enhanced accountability and responsibility in the delivery of railway policing in Scotland .  Option 3  Proceed to full integration, with date to be informed by Police Scotland ."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-government-backs-greater-human-rights-checks-on-firms-after-dodgy-10bn-china-deal","story":"  Public bodies will also have to undertake stricter due diligence on potential commercial partners in the wake of the Government\u0026rsquos botched \u0026pound10bn investment agreement with a Chinese consortium.  In 2016, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon signed a \u0026ldquomemorandum of understanding with SinoFortone and China Railway No. 3 Engineering Group  at Bute House.  At the time, SinoFortone said the partnership could lead to \"signicant investment\" in areas including clean energy, transport and affordable housing in Scotland.  Ms Sturgeon did not publicise the agreement when it was struck and details only came to light after reports surfaced in the Chinese press.  It then emerged that CR3 parent company, China Railway Group , had been blacklisted by Norway\u0026rsquos oil fund following corruption allegations.  The ethics council of the Norwegian pension fund warned in 2014 there was a \"high degree of probability\" the firm \"paid bribes to government officials for contracts regarding construction of railways and housing projects\" in China.  The negative publicity was followed by the companies withdrawing from the memorandum and the proposal collapsed.  It was then revealed last year that the London-registered SinoFortune had failed to carry out many of the projects it had been linked to.  The report stated that the firm had not registered any company accounts and the only deal it had finalised was the purchase of a Buckinghamshire pub - the Plough Inn at Cadsden.  Sir Richard Heygate, who was SinoFortune\u0026rsquos UK agent, later described the firm as \u0026ldquoall bollocks. He added: \u0026ldquoIt shows how careless the first minister was to put pen to paper on a deal with Chinese companies she knew absolutely nothing about.\"  In June, the Government released its \u0026ldquoengagement strategy with China, but it also published a \u0026ldquoguidance document on due diligence and human rights for public bodies.  According to the recommendations, the Government and its quangos should assess whether a company, including a parent firm or subsidiary, has been linked to human rights abuses anywhere in the world. The checks would apply to where \u0026ldquodirect financial support is provided through grants, loans, financial investments and equity shares.  Non-financial support, such as when the Government acts as a broker between \u0026ldquotwo or more private sector partners, would also be put under the microscope.  Ministers have insisted the \u0026ldquoinitial checking should take place ahead of any meetings and more \u0026ldquosubstantive due diligence should occur as the relationship \u0026ldquodevelops and deepens.  The document also notes: \u0026ldquoCan the organisation or investor provide assurance on financial viability? Does it have any past record of financial wrongdoing, for example bribery or corruption?  Two months after the guidance was published, it was revealed that jobs quango Scottish Enterprise had given arms manufacturer Raytheon nearly \u0026pound200,000 between 2014 and 2017.  Raytheon makes guidance systems for Paveway missiles, which have been used by Saudi Arabia for bombings in Yemen.  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: \"It shouldn\u0027t taken 15 months to produce this guidance after Keith Brown had to apologise to Parliament for signing a dodgy deal with some shady companies. These new proposals need to be rigorously enforced on and we will be keeping a close eye on whether they\u0026rsquore up to the job.\"  A Scottish Government spokesperson said the guidance produced is sufficient."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-unveils-plan-for-post-brexit-festival-of-union-to-take-place-in-2022","story":"  Explaining her proposal for 2022, the year of the next scheduled General Election, and a year after the 2012 Holyrood poll, the Prime Minister said: \"We want to showcase what makes our country great today.  \"We want to capture that spirit for a new generation, celebrate our nation\u0027s ersity and talent, and mark this moment of national renewal with a once-in-a-generation celebration.\"  The Festival of the Union, as it has already been dubbed, will echo the 1851 Great Exhibition and the 1951 Festival of Britain.

But with less than three weeks to go to the crunch October European Council, Mr Raab will use his keynote speech to the Conservative conference in Birmingham to rule out any deal which \"locks in\" Britain to the EU by membership of a customs union or the European Economic Area.  He will also reject the European Commission\u0027s proposal for a \"backstop\" solution to the Irish border issue under which Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU customs area.  The Secretary of State will say: \"We are leaving the European Union in fact not just in name. If we can\u0027t obtain a deal that secures that objective... an attempt is made to lock us in via the back door of the EEA and customs union...or  the only offer from the EU threatens the integrity of our Union, then we will be left with no choice but to leave without a deal.\"  Restating his backing for Mrs May\u0027s Chequers Plan, Mr Raab will say: \"My approach to Brexit is pragmatic, not dogmatic. Our proposals would deliver a historic agreement that provides a roadmap out of the EU and a final deal that will be good for the whole country.  \"A deal that delivers on the referendum, because that\u0027s our democratic duty\u0026hellipthat manages the risks of Brexit, because that\u0027s our responsibility\u0026hellipthat grasps the opportunities of Brexit, because we\u0027re at our best when we\u0027re optimistic about the future.  \"And a deal that protects our precious Union, because we are the Conservative and Unionist Party,\" he will declare.  Mr Raab\u0026rsquos words follow remarks from Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, who hit out at the EU for \"taunting\" the UK since its rejection of the Chequers Plan at the Salzburg summit.  The first day of conference was dominated by the party\u0026rsquos Brexit psychodrama with Theresa May and her colleagues defending her compromise proposals against Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos attack in which he branded them \u0026ldquoderanged.  The Prime Minister insisted her beleaguered Chequers Plan was not dead as she refused to rule out making any more compromises to secure a deal.  She sought to reject Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos suggestion that, as a true believer in Brexit, his \u0026ldquosuper-Canada trade deal plan was better placed to succeed than her blueprint, by declaring: \u0026ldquoI believe in Brexit.  Mrs May also did not deny that a no-deal scenario would create a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, simply stating repeatedly that the UK Government was \"committed\" to ensuring that a hard border would not happen.  Ruth Davidson came to the PM\u0026rsquos defence, suggesting Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos harsh putdown of her Brexit compromise was \u0026ldquonot wise and called for Tory colleagues to observe a \u0026ldquoperiod of silence to give Mrs May the space to secure a deal.  Today in her address to conference, the Scottish Conservative leader will strike out again at the former Foreign Secretary and his fellow Brexiteers by extolling the Conservative virtues of pragmatism and practicality and decrying the \u0026ldquoivory-towered schemes of the ideological puritan.  She will tell conference: \u0026ldquoHere\u0026rsquos the truth: we can agree a Brexit deal under the Conservatives or we can risk handing the keys of Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn. I know which one I believe is in the national interest. I stand by the Prime Minister.  Last night, Mrs May failed to turn up at the Scottish Conservative reception or indeed any other reception in a bid, said party sources, to \"save her voice\" and avoid a repeat of last year\u0026rsquos embarrassing episode when she lost it repeatedly during her end-of-conference speech. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, filled in for the PM at the Scots event.  Earlier, the PM unveiled a plan for a Festival of Brexit Britain to celebrate our \u0026ldquoprecious Union planned for 2022.  And she announced plans to charge foreign home buyers in England up to a three per cent higher rate of stamp duty to stop them driving up prices in the UK with the revenue used use to tackle homelessness.

The campaigners are concerned that a large chunk of Loch Lomond is to be handed over for the project fronted by Iconic Leisure Developments \"for the sake of a high-end tourist resort\".  \"The damage will do far outweights any positives,\" said Mr Greer.  Scottish Enterprise said that negotiations over the final sale of the 44 acres of land needed for the project were still ongoing. The Scottish Government agency said it was obliged to negotiate \"an appropriate market value so that we get maximum value for the public purse\".  \"We are not yet at the point to commence commercial discussions,\" a Scottish Enterprise spokesman said. \"These discussions are likely to take place once the outline planning application has been determined.\"  The 20,000 are in addition to the 1000 who have already lodged their opposition.    Cameron McNeish, the Scottish hiker and backpacker who has written books, newspaper columns and television broadcasts, announced his objection, branding the plans \u0026ldquoa potentially disastrous agreement.

Campaigners are concerned about the damage to ancient woodland, pollution of standing and running water and the effect on red squirrels and otters.

We will not outspend him with reckless borrowing, we will not promise the illusory utopia he offers because, as those who have tried it have shown time and time again, it is based on a lie and it always ends in tears.\"  He explained how no one should mistake the Conservative belief in evolution over revolution for a lack of passion or commitment to change, to a paucity of values or ideals.  \u0026ldquoThroughout history, Conservative governments from Peel to Disraeli to Thatcher have delivered momentous change, drawing on our values that have stood the test of time.  \u0026ldquoThe importance of family and community the strength of our nation, united by history, culture and identity standing strong as a force for good in the world the insight that economic freedom goes hand in hand with political freedom and, above all, the belief in the power of enterprise as the route to unleash talent and to improve lives.  \u0026ldquoThat is why we back business, declared the Chancellor. \u0026ldquoWe back business as the cornerstone of a successful economy, as a force for good in our society and as an essential expression of our values.  \u0026ldquoSo just in case anyone, anywhere, was in any doubt at all, let me say it, loud and clear: the Conservative Party is, and always will be, the party of business.

The measure formed part of a programme to \"regenerate capitalism\" which the Chancellor said was needed to tackle the challenges of the modern world and renew the appeal of the free market to a new generation.  \"The best way to tax international companies is through international agreement,\" explained Mr Hammond.  \"But the time for talking is coming to an end and the stalling has to stop. If we cannot reach agreement, the UK will go it alone with a Digital Services Tax of its own,\" he declared.  The Chancellor acknowledged that many voters felt \"left behind\" by economic change and feared they would fall further behind as new technologies like articial intelligence and driverless cars made their jobs obsolete.  He warned that the Tories must persuade these people that the market system could work for them or see them fall for the \"seductive simplicities\" offered by Labour.  In response, John McDonnell for Labour said: \u0026ldquoThe Chancellor\u0026rsquos speech confirmed the bankrupt state of the Tory Party increasingly irrelevant and cut off from the real day to day le most people experience.  The Shadow Chancellor added: \u0026ldquoThe Tories are bereft of any fresh ideas, forced to resort to a half-hearted filching of policies from others and desperately trying to revive long outdated slogans. As the Tories sink into a pit of bitter infighting, we mustn\u0027t allow them to take the country down with it."},{"url":null,"title":"charity marks opening of new headquarters","story":"        A north east charity held an official opening ceremony last week to celebrate its new headquarters.

Other areas of strength include the University’s role in supporting the local and national economy through its energy-related teaching and research activities, recently demonstrated by the creation of a National Decommissioning Centre.The Guide has also taken into account Aberdeen’s activities in areas of importance including widening access, investment in facilities, student welfare, and internationalisation – the University opened its first overseas campus in Qatar last year.Professor George Boyne, Principal, said: “This is a major honour and a testament to the efforts of our staff and students, as well as the great sense of identity and community that we have at Aberdeen.“As an institution we consistently attract students with exceptional ability and potential, and this - along with the quality of our teaching - has been an important factor in our success in areas such as degree outcomes and graduate employability.                                                                                                         “In addition, our strength in research - exemplied by the Queens Anniversary Prize for our contribution to health services research - places us at the forefront of innovation in key areas of economic, environmental and societal importance.“This University was founded in 1495 with the purpose of being open to all and dedicated to the pursuit of truth in the service of others, and this continues to inspire our academic achievements.“Our focus on widening access and inclusivity, strength in interdisciplinary teaching and research, and international outlook are the modern-day interpretation of our founding principles, which have played a major role in Aberdeen being named Scottish University of the Year.“I’d like to congratulate everyone at the University who has worked so hard to help us achieve this honour.”                                                                                                        Alastair McCall, editor of The Sunday Times Good University Guide, said: \"Aberdeen\u0027s sharp rise up our league table this year is the biggest of any university in the top 30 and gives it a ranking commensurate to its status as one of the UK\u0027s leading academic institutions.\"It was a clear winner of our Scottish University of the Year award and earned a shortlisting for the UK University of the Year title off the back of improved performances in most of the metrics used in our tables.

He was aged only 29 but during his short le distinguished himself as one of the foremost archaeologists of his day.Alexander Henry Rhind was born in Wick on July 26, 1833. His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank. He owned substantial property in the new and bustling Pulteneytown and settled himself in his property at Sibster where the young Alexander grew up.Alexander attended Pulteneytown Academy, going on to study natural history and natural philosophy at Edinburgh University.Following his work in 1851 on the cairns at Yarrows, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries at 19 years of age. He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Tuesday 2 Oct 2018 3:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world. September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low. Several experienced midwives are either retiring or leaving because of the added workload and the burden it is causing.Bill Fernie of the pressure group Caithness Health Action Team said he was not surprised that a midwe felt compelled to speak out.He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a terrible situation for the staff to find themselves in. They should be commended for all their efforts.\u0026ldquoTravelling to Raigmore places more than enough strain on the mums and their families so going to Glasgow would have added to that. I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an inidual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.\u0026ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be erted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver elsewhere due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwe whom you interviewed.Tuesday 2 Oct 2018 3:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117725.jpg","title":"Businesses have lots to celebrate","story":"\u0026nbspCAITHNESS Chamber of Commerce celebrated another successful year for business in the North Highlands at its 46th annual dinner on Friday.Around 200 organisations were represented at the event in Wick\u0027s Norseman Hotel which again underlined the ersity of the local business community and showcased the opportunities the area has to offer.After a welcome from the chamber\u0027s chairman, Stephen Sutherland, and an opening speech from chamber patron Lord Thurso, guests heard a speech from Cathy Craig, commercial and memberships director of Entrepreneurial Scotland.Cathy spoke passionately about entrepreneurialism in Scotland and explained how her grandmother sparked her interest in business.

This places Orkney third nationwide in terms of the highest empty property rates — behind Shetland and Western Isles specically.Councillor Rob Crichton, chair of the council\u0026#8217s education, leisure and housing committee, said: \u0026#8220Empty homes represent a signicant drain on rural communities, affecting their ability to rejuvenate and grow. They can, however, be utilised to directly counter the issues they once caused.\u0026#8220An empty home brought back into use as a primary residence represents another family in the community, potentially more children in local schools, and more money spent at local businesses.\u0026#8221The document is available at http:www.orkney.gov.uk/Council/C/empty-homes-strategy-consultation.htm and is under consultation until Wednesday, October 24, at 5pm.Any comments should be submitted to Rachael Bowes, Empty Homes Development Officer via email rachael.bowes@orkney.gov.uk.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There will also need to be clarity, after the missed deadline this summer, over how reduced ferry fares can be rolled out across the Northern Isles and what impact that will have on the service.“This is also an opportunity for the Scottish Government to set out its aspirations for real improvements for the service into the 2020s. People on the islands will be looking to see how they intend to address the demands for freight as well as meeting passenger needs in terms of on-board accommodation and internet connectivity.

Ministers must now learn the lessons of the previous tendering process and make sure that they listen to local stakeholders and respond to the needs of our island communities.\u0026#8220This contract needs to drive service improvements and improved capacity on these leline routes. This needs to happen both in relation to freight and restoring the cuts to services on the Pentland Firth ushered in under the current contract.“It is imperative that the Pentland Firth and Aberdeen services continue to operate as one and are not ‘unbundled’. I also believe that we need to see Stromness and Scrabster as designated ports again under any future contract.”“Getting the detail right will require the minister and his officials to engage early and on an ongoing basis with the island councils, local businesses and other key stakeholders.

If you look around the Highlands we are blessed with the most beautul scenery, but much of it can be hilly.\"This would provide a 6km path with no steep climbs or gradients and that could be a unique feature \u0026ndash certainly unique for around here.\"Mr Macauley said \u0026pound500,000 in total\u0026nbsp would be needed to complete the project, which he hoped would be possible \"in a few years.\"Planning permission and landowner agreement have recently been granted for the next stage and an application for finance has been lodged with the Scottish Rural Development Fund .Mr Macauley said: \"It is an excellent project with a lot of potential to bring a lot of good to the community. It will be a safe corridor for people to walk and cycle and help people avoid going on a dangerous road.\"Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said she strongly supported the project because \"absolutely everyone in the community can get out and enjoy nature.\"She said: \"I think the Peffery Way will become a vital link between Strathpeffer and Dingwall and all the communities in between.\"The path is both offroad and flat \u0026ndash two huge advantages.\"It will be a fantastic asset for travel to school and work or just for visiting pals.\"To find out more about the project and donate see www.pefferywayassociation.scotTuesday 2 Oct 2018 3:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Two years ago we tackled the seven-mile course when he was only six, this time we walked from Aultbea to Poolewe and have again raised a fantastic amount thanks to our generous supporters,\" said Tom.\"Unlike some Huntington\u0026rsquos disease charities 100 per cent of the money raised for the SHA goes to supporting families living with the condition. They leave research funding to others which, is great for families like us who rely so much on the support they offer.\"Since my we Helen was diagnosed 15 years ago they have been invaluable to our family and our caseworker Gordon Bogan has been immense in helping us cope.\"SHA supports Huntington\u0026rsquos disease families through a national network of specialists, a world leading youth support team and its financial wellbeing service.Huntington\u0026rsquos disease is a complex condition with symptoms that typically begin to develop between the ages of 30 and 50. It causes three main groups of symptoms: changes to thinking processes \u0026ndash a type of early onset dementia loss of muscle control and involuntary movements which lead to loss of speech and swallow, along with mental illness.Those impacted by Huntington\u0026rsquos disease may lose the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink or make decisions and will eventually need 24-hour care. It is also hereditary with each child of those diagnosed at 50 per cent risk of developing the disease. There is currently no cure.It is estimated there are around 1100 people living with Huntington\u0026rsquos disease in Scotland and up to 6000 potentially at risk.\"Now that we have completed the middle distance I think Jacob will be keen on tackling the full 25 miles pretty soon, although I\u0026rsquom not sure  I\u0026rsquoll be joining him without some serious training,\" added Tom.Anyone interested in fundraising for the SHA should contact Linda Winters on 0141 848 0308 or email linda.winter@hdscotland.orgTuesday 2 Oct 2018 3:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is thought the smaller site would close  the new store went ahead, although Co-op Food had not responded by the time the Ross-shire Journal went to print.The applicant, Northquest Ltd, has also earmarked two further building plots for possible future development within the proposed store\u0026rsquos grounds \u0026ndash another 6000 sq ft building and one covering 2500 sq ft.The store would be accessed via Ness Road and have parking for 79 cars and two motorbikes. The access road also features a bell-shaped junction at its far end, opening up the possibility that nearby land may also be developed in the future  the site went ahead.The Fortrose and Rosemarkie Community Council has unanimously opposed the proposals, citing concerns over its location within a designated buffer zone that is designed to keep Fortrose and Rosemarkie from merging into one.Chairman Tom Heath said the community council felt the application fell foul of two elements of the local development plan, the first of which was its location.He added: \u0026ldquoThe second is that we were concerned of the effects it would have on the rest of the High Street and the viability of the remainder of the businesses on High Street [ it relocated].Those reactions have been shared by some residents, who have been responding to a consultation launched by the community council.While many welcomed the prospect of a larger Co-op store and greater iety on its shelves, others raised fears that the existing High Street shop\u0026rsquos off-street car park could be lost in the move \u0026ndash forcing cars to park on the main road and putting greater pressure on this notorious traffic bottleneck.Others shared the community council\u0026rsquos argument that the development is on land zoned as off-limits in the local development plan.Fears had been raised that a decision last year by Highland councillors to approve a new \u0026pound4million care home within this buffer zone would set a precedent that opened up the wider area to development. It was passed despite the objection of planning officers.And this concern was shared by some of the public.Responding on Facebook to the community council\u0026rsquos call for comment, Gail Paterson said: \u0026ldquoIt will kill Fortrose High Street  allowed. The care home  has set a precedent so can\u0026rsquot see how this can be knocked back and from there on in the land will go to housing without the infrastructure being sorted out.Bridget Gerstner added: \u0026ldquoThe shop would be nice but not there. This is the foot in the door. Once we agree to this site, there will be no stopping building on the land between Fortrose and Rosemarkie.Mr Heath said the community council had taken fears over the care home\u0026rsquos impact on the buffer zone to council officers last year, and that they had been given assurances that its approval would not set a precedent.- Share your view.

A report to councillors explained how monitoring of public buildings fitted with solar panels was incomplete and that some \u0026ldquodata was calculated for two sites that had actually been deleted from the process the previous year.Worse still, despite previous agreed management action, \u0026ldquono record of eligible sites has been established, the report stated. It added: \u0026ldquoThere is no definitive site list. There is no robust system in place to capture meter readings for renewable energy from photovoltaic solar panels.Mr Black offered an apology for the audit\u0026rsquos revelations.Council leader Margaret Davidson told colleagues: \u0026ldquoOur carbon emissions are more than they should be and it\u0026rsquos costing us a lot of money. That can\u0026rsquot be changed unless we\u0026rsquove got accurate management and record keeping.She said she would request that officials review the processes, how decisions are made within the relevant department and the scrutiny of the work it does.Speaking afterwards, councillor Roddy Balfour, a colleague in the minority independent administration said it amounted to \u0026ldquogross incompetence.He said he hoped the audit and scrutiny committee, which is chaired by opposition SNP councillor Graham MacKenzie, would ensure that the issues would be urgently addressed and keep the council within national guidelines associated with climate change policies.Highlands and Islands Green MSP John Finnie, a former councillor, said: \u0026ldquoThe council\u0026rsquos latest bungle is seriously concerning. It\u0026rsquos failed to collect data which is necessary to assess its contribution to tackling climate change. A commitment that \u0026lsquoit would not be allowed to happen for a fourth successive year\u0026rsquo is cold comfort. It should not have been allowed to get to this stage.\u0026ldquoPerhaps I shouldn\u0026rsquot be surprised. When the council does collect information it regularly ignores it \u0026ndash all too evident in the shambles that is their public toilet closure plan. Let\u0026rsquos hope the appointment of a new chief executive will bring a renewed focus on evidencing decisions, by both collecting the appropriate evidence and acting on it.Tuesday 2 Oct 2018 3:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Also scheduled is a revamp of the heating system to make it more economic and efficient and modernisation of the toilets.Additional space for rental is also part of the plans. A spokeswoman for the group said: \u0026ldquoWe anticipate that these refurbishments should enable a much better experience for the many users of the village hall and also encourage greater use of the facility.A budget of around \u0026pound250,000 has been set aside for the work which has been primarily raised from three sources \u0026mdash the Highland Council, SSE\u0026rsquos energy efficiency fund and Fairburn wind farm fund and the Highland Cross.The spokeswoman added: \u0026ldquoThe Muir of Ord Hall and Facilities Company is very grateful for these contributions and some local donations, without which we would not have been able to proceed.The Muir of Ord Village Hall on Seaforth Road has been a community hub for the village since 1893. In 2009, following the Highland Council\u0026rsquos decision to est itself of the building, a public meeting agreed that the community should take on ownership of the resource.An option appraisal committed the community association to establish a separate company limited by guarantee to hold the ownership of the hall. The Muir of Ord Hall \u0026amp Facilities Company was set up in April 2011 and bought the hall from the council for \u0026pound1 in May 2012.It was accepted at the time that  it was ever to cover its own costs, a refurbishment would be required.

Recent figures showed the fund increased in value in 2016-17 by \u0026pound31.1 million. As of last weekend, it was valued at \u0026pound2,013,164,722.61.Addressing colleagues on the audit and scrutiny committee, Cllr MacLean called for a review of investment strategy. She acknowledged the need to secure the best .But she added: \u0026ldquoSome people are not happy with some of the investments and feel that perhaps  it\u0026rsquos invested in tobacco or arms or things like that, it\u0026rsquos not ethically responsible.She asked whether fund trustees had any say in the choice of investments.The council\u0026rsquos investments change on a daily basis.Recent examples of contentious choices include British American Tobacco , liqueurs firm Pernod Ricard , pubs chain Mitchells and Butlers , Japan Tobacco  and China\u0026rsquos second largest brewery, Tsingtao .The council\u0026rsquos finance director Derek Yule explained that an investments sub-committee reports to a pension board which sets the strategy.\u0026ldquoIt is very dficult when some of the investment strategy seeks to invest in shares in companies not just in the UK but worldwide, he said.\u0026ldquoWhilst I totally understand some of the ethical debate, it is very dficult to draw a line sometimes.\u0026ldquoYou might take a view\u0026hellip would you invest in banks, for example? They might not be the best investment, anyway. But I use that as an example because banks will fund these companies.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a dficult balancing act but it\u0026rsquos certainly within your rights  you wished the pension board to look at the investment strategy.\u0026ldquoFund managers are given guidelines to work to, so that would be quite legitimate for the council to do through the pension board.According to current policy, the fund \u0026ldquorecognises that social, environmental and ethical considerations are among factors investment managers will take into account, where relevant, when selecting investments for purchase, retention or sale.However, it stresses that \u0026ldquothe overriding consideration for pension committee members is their fiduciary duty to the scheme employers and scheme members.The Scheme Advisory Board, established up by the Scottish Government to regulate such public sector pension funds, recently obtained advice from legal counsel on the duty of pensions committees.The guidance concluded that: \u0026ldquoPensions committees in Scotland owe a fiduciary duty to the scheme employers and the scheme members in general and specically in relation to investment matters.\u0026ldquoThose duties should be exercised in the best interests of the beneficiaries and in relation to investment decisions, should aim to achieve the best financial position for the fund, balancing risk and  in the usual way.Tuesday 2 Oct 2018 3:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

The creation of a specic Scottish Government ministerial portfolio focussed on international trade, reflecting both the current environment and the government\u0026#8217s priorities, has been widely welcomed.                 Whatever happens with Brexit, Scotland needs to accelerate its focus on increasing exports and attracting inward investment. Those deals are critical to our future prosperity. Building innovative businesses is key to that success.            I join a strong team of ministers in the new finance and economy portfolio. Our focus is to ensure that Scotland’s economy, and our inclusive growth agenda, is centre stage across government. Our immediate priority is to engage with businesses – listening to their challenges and understanding how government can provide effective support.             Over the summer, I met dozens of businesses across many sectors and from all parts of Scotland, including highly innovative le sciences start-ups in Dundee, successful exporters in food and textiles in the Highlands  and rapidly-growing manufacturing businesses in Fe. This article appeared in Deals 2018. A digital version can be found here. I’ve witnessed the great work our universities do to attract inward investment and to support innovation, including through our eight sector-focussed innovation centres. I’ve seen how the Scottish Government’s £48 million investment in our new National Manufacturing Institute for Scotland is being applied, building on the success of our Advanced Forming Research Centre and putting Scotland at the forefront of Industry 4.0.It’s satisfying to know that my experience of building exporting businesses before coming into politics is being put to good use.Scotland’s track record on trade is solid – the latest information reporting a 53 per cent increase in international exports over ten years. Scotland’s 2,350 foreign-owned companies are a major contributor to our economy, delivering a combined turnover of £86 billion and employing more than 300,000 staff. And we remain competitive in attracting foreign direct investment .            The 2018 Ernst \u0026amp Young Attractiveness Survey reported a 7 per cent annual increase in new FDI projects in Scotland and the highest number of jobs created for a decade. We have consolidated our position as the UK’s most popular inward investment location outside of London, and Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen all feature in the top-tenUK cities for attracting FDI. The quality of that FDI is also noteworthy – Scotland secured 24 per cent of all UK research and development projects in 2017 and digital projects grew by 56 per cent to become the second-largest sector behind business services.Scottish Development International is extremely effective in attracting international companies and high-value projects to Scotland, and in anchoring investors for the long term. I’ve visited the Scottish Government’s innovation and investment hub in Dublin which – along with our hubs in Paris, Berlin, Brussels and London – is on the front line of our export and inward investment drive. The Scottish Government has increased its investment in the economy this year by 64 per cent, as part of a £2.4bn investment in enterprise and skills. We have the most competitive business rates system in the UK and provide sectoral and business growth support through our enterprise agencies. The consolidation and expansion of government support for business investment through the new Scottish National Investment Bank further demonstrates our determination to put our money where our mouth is.             We have strong foundations to build upon, but there is still much work to do.Scotland has huge economic potential across many sectors where we can boast truly world-class capabilities and we are well placed to take advantage of the opportunities that emerge.Our ‘Scotland is Now’, campaign, launched in April and putting Scotland in the international spotlight, showcases our world-leading assets to a global audience. It harnesses the collective efforts of Scottish Government, VisitScotland, Scottish Development International and Universities Scotland to promote the country under a single, unied national brand.  ‘Scotland is Now’ is designed to put the country at the top of everyone’s list of places to live, work, study, invest and visit – a destination of choice for tourism and a vehicle for showing that our exports, such as food and drink, oil and gas, manufacturing and financial services, are of the highest calibre. In many ways, Scotland is an optimally sized country, with an accessible, agile government able to bring together key players and decision makers in order to respond to challenges and seize opportunities. We have seen this deployed to good effect to safeguard and create jobs in steel, shipbuilding and aluminium smelting in recent years. This close co-operation between government and business is something we intend to build on.            Scotland’s public finances continue to improve and our economy is growing twice as fast as the UK as a whole. These trends – along with recent labour market, productivity and GDP data – show we are on the right track. And we will continue to use our devolved powers to best effect, which the forthcoming Export Action Plan I intend to bring forward will demonstrate. However, actions on population growth, participation in the labour market and productivity are also essential and require Westminster to play its part too, or to give the Scottish Parliament the tools to deliver them.

Duke of Buccleuch may be legally within his rights but sale plans to clear land for forestry are morally flawed, writes Lesley Riddoch.                Is Scotland’s biggest landowner victimising the tenant farmer who accused him of clearing people to make way for trees?            Last week, the Duke of Buccleuch put a portfolio of land on the market called Evertown, which includes farms, productive farmland, commercial forestry and planting opportunities near Canonbie in Dumfries and Galloway. The 9,000 acres is composed of 18 lots on sale for £19.5 million – most hill ground is priced at three times its agricultural value and advertised as “suitable for forestry planting”.            : Video: Who are Scotland’s biggest landowners?It includes Alison and David Telfer’s tenanted farm near the Dumfriesshire village of Langholm, despite earlier promises that the duke would reflect on local anger about removing tenants to secure lucrative forestry planting grants. Local MSP Joan McAlpine has been working behind the scenes on this case and says: “The duke and his factors are unflinchingly cruel in the case of the Telfers. He could easily allow them to see out their working lives at the farm – instead he has split their farm into two lots for sale, removing part of it imminently. The Telfers believe they are being victimised by a powerful and vindictive organisation, and I am inclined to agree.”• : Duke of Buccleuch to sell off thousands of acres of land in BordersThe higher ground of the Telfer’s farm, Cleuchfoot, is being sold for planting under the locally unfamiliar name of “Tansy Hill” combined with a small block of forestry five miles distant. The farmhouse and lower ground are up for sale in a separate lot, though the Telfers have been allowed to stay till next November.            Ms McAlpine said: “Alison and David say breaking up the farm disguises the fact it’s their ground being cleared and sold for tree planting. Cleuchfoot is synonymous with their fight, Tansy Hill means nothing. They think this is deliberate and misleading.”The Telfers say the Buccleuch estate intends to value their sheep for sale on 10 October and will remove the animals soon after. It’s unclear whether Forestry Scotland has approved tree planting. Government ministers have said forestry grants shouldn’t be misused and the duke may know he will be refused permission for mass planting on tenanted farms because of the public outcry when news of terminated leases broke earlier this year.Joan McAlpine said: “Potential purchasers need to be made aware of the situation. The duke could easily allow Alison and David to retire in five years and then sell the land, as promised. It would not hurt His Grace at all. But being forced out is definitely hurting Alison and David.”Of course, the Buccleuch Estate contests this account.            A spokesman refuted the suggestion that the Telfers are being “cleared off their land” as “a complete distortion of the facts” and described Ms McAlpine’s comments as “ inaccurate and inflammatory.” The estate maintains this is not an eviction, but simply the ending of a lease. They say the Telfers have always known of the estate’s long-term plans and the idea they’re being removed for tree planting is “utterly wrong.” They say the Telfers have been given extensions beyond their removal date and the chance to buy the farmhouse and surrounding ground. But how would two people on a frugal income, approaching retirement with no assets find an asking price of £600k? Furthermore, the Telfers have been farming at Cleuchfoot for almost 20 years on a succession of insecure tenancy agreements. Why have these been the only option available? And  the estate has no plan to plant trees, why the urgent need to remove them? Of course Scotland’s Tenant Farming Commissioner, Bob McIntosh, did investigate earlier complaints of bullying and found the duke’s estate acted in compliance with the law.Buccleuch have said the current land sale will honour existing leasing agreements and tenant farmers with secure, long-term tenancies have the chance to buy their farms. It’s believed none have been completed yet though – in part because of restrictive sale conditions.Scottish Land Commission chair Andrew Thin says “We will review the actions Buccleuch now takes with care, and stand ready to offer advice where required.” But he welcomes the move to ersy land ownership. So do farming organisations. So do I.            I’d welcome it a lot more  local farmers were guaranteed a fair chance of becoming future owners. But the question remains.Is it morally acceptable for landowners to get Forestry Commission Scotland grants for planting trees on land where tenant farmers have been cleared and evicted? If not, then the law must change and removals must stop.The practice of shipping people off the land for fracking, tree-planting and wind farms is no more acceptable today than evicting tens of thousands for sheep farming and deer hunting in the Highlands or agricultural and industrial uses in the Lowlands. As Tom Devine’s new book The Scottish Clearances makes graphically clear, eviction and removal of insecure tenants by the landed classes has been a Scotland-wide way of le for centuries. Recent removals of tenant farmers Andrew Stoddart from Haddington and the Paterson family from Arran show that grim way of le continues. It shames Scotland.So who will protect the Telfers?Forestry Commission Scotland  say: “The current forestry grant scheme guidance states applicants must have control of the land and a legal right to plant trees.  We want to be confident that where control has recently changed, or land has come out of farming, any actions taken to end a tenancy or farming partnership by the previous or new owner have been entirely legal.”But these moves are always entirely legal. The question is – are they moral and is the law an ass?FCS may be shamed into declining grant applications from new and existing owners of contested, cleared land.  But that won’t help the Telfers, the campaign to reforest Scotland, the empowerment of local people on quasi-feudal sporting estates or public faith in our land lawsNo new land reform bill is planned for this parliament. Yet we desperately need a way to protect all tenant farmers and ersy large landholdings. Progress is painfully slow and public support for a land tax system is growing.None of this will be formally discussed at the SNP conference. But where does rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing stand? I’m sure the land reform supporting public and the Telfers would love to know.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4807775.1538394125!/image/image.jpg","title":"lower drink drive limit has had little effect on road safety","story":"                The study by Strathclyde University found that the lower limit for blood alcohol content  had not been followed by a statistically signicant overall drop in road fatalities, including during the peak accident periods of night-time and weekends.            There was also little change in the death rate for young drivers aged 16-25, who are seen as one of the highest-risk groups for drink-driving.            The legal alcohol limit for driving was reduced from 80mg to 50mg in every 100ml of blood in 2014.The researchers, from Strathclyde\u0026rsquos Department of Economics, are clear that they are not suggesting that previous BAC limit reductions had not been ineffective only that the most recent  reduction had not had a material impact on road safety.The study assessed data on more than 1.1 million accidents, leading to 1.5 million casualties and more than 14,000 fatalities, between 2009 and 2016, with prevailing weather conditions also taken into account.They found that, in the two years leading up to the lower BAC limit, Scotland had monthly accident rates of 740.63 and fatality rates of 14.96.In the two years after the new limit was introduced, the rates were 704.13 for accidents and 15.25 for fatalities. This was consistent with England and Wales, where the BAC limit remained unchanged.            The change in policy did not appreciably affect overall accident rates, which statistically increased slightly by 0.18 accidents per 100,000 of population, although this is not statistically signicant.The researchers said: \u0026ldquoWhile there may be other reasons to pursue a reduction in the BAC limits, our results suggest that this further BAC limit reductions has not achieved all that might have been hoped for it in terms of road safety.\u0026ldquoThis is not to say that previous BAC limit reductions have been an ineffective means of preventing traffic fatalities. Instead, our results indicate that the marginal s to further BAC reductions in terms of road safety are small, which is result that policy makers should take into account when weighing the costs and benefits of alcohol-control policies.Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the Scottish Beer \u0026amp Pub Association, said: \u0026ldquoThe change in the drink-driving limit may not have affected road accidents, but it has definitely affected the  nation\u0026rsquos pubs.

The UK will walk away from Brexit talks  the EU pushes too hard for concessions on Theresa May\u0026#8217s plans, Dominic Raab is set to warn in the toughest rhetoric towards Brussels yet.                The Brexit Secretary will today tell the Conservative conference in Birmingham that “our willingness to compromise is not without limits”, and warns that “we will be left with no choice but to leave without a deal”  the EU’s position threatens the integrity of the Union.            Yesterday the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, also struck a defiant tone towards Brussels, claiming the UK will not be the only “prisoner” wanting to leave the EU  it is turned into a jail.            Mr Hunt warned EU negotiators to “never ever mistake British politeness for British weakness” and likened their desire to “punish” the UK to the Soviet Union.The tough talk comes after the first day of the Tory conference in Birmingham descended into fresh infighting over Brexit, with senior Conservatives hitting back at Boris Johnson for calling the Prime Minister’s strategy “deranged”. The former foreign secretary crashed through the first day of the Tory conference in Birmingham, saying the Chequers plan was “entirely preposterous” and suggesting that Theresa May wasn’t committed to delivering Brexit.• : Theresa May warned she faces ‘polite rebellion’ over BrexitIt brought a sharp response from Brexiteers and Remainers, with the former Brexit secretary David Davis mocking Mr Johnson’s plans for a bridge linking Britain and Ireland, and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson calling for a “period of silence”.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Mr Johnson said: “Unlike the Prime Minister, I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it’s the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016.”            Last night at a pro-Brexit fringe meeting, Scottish Tory MP Ross Thomson called Chequers an “unmitigated disaster that has humiliated us at home and in the EU, and is breaking this party apart”. The isions will continue today with a fringe meeting attended by two former ministers calling for a second EU referendum on the terms of the UK’s Brexit deal.Mrs May insisted she was acting in “the national interest” by pushing ahead with a plan to keep the UK aligned with the EU in trade of goods, in a bid to maintain the status quo along the Irish border and limit the damage to the economy.The Prime Minister told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme: “I do believe in Brexit. Crucially, I believe in delivering Brexit in a way that respects the vote and delivers on the vote of the British people while also protecting our union, protecting jobs and ensuring we make a success of Brexit for the future.”She said the onus was on the EU to come forward with detailed explanations of its concerns, along with counter-proposals for discussion. “Chequers at the moment is the only plan on the table that delivers on the Brexit vote and also delivers for the people of Northern Ireland,” the Prime Minister told Marr.            “Where they have problems, let’s actually hear them and it’s only then that you can actually identy what the issue really is, where there are issues that lie behind this.“My mood is to listen to what the EU have to say about their concerns and to sit down and talk them through with them.”Ms Davidson questioned why the former foreign secretary was against a plan for the Irish border that was signed off by the full cabinet in December.“There’s been time over the last two years for debate,” she told the BBC’s Sunday Politics Scotland programme.“The former foreign secretary was in one of the great offices of state during the time that much of this plan was being constructed – and praised it as soon ago as last year.            “In terms of a period of silence, I would be very welcoming of one.”Addressing the conference today, Ms Davidson will appeal for unity and call for party members to “go back to our Conservative principles” and reject Brexit dogma.“We can agree a Brexit deal under the Conservatives, or we can risk handing the keys of Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn,” Ms Davidson will say. “I know which one I believe is in the national interest. I stand by the Prime Minister.”In his speech in Birmingham, Mr Raab will describe his approach to Brexit as “pragmatic, not dogmatic”.“Our proposals would deliver a historic agreement that provides a roadmap out of the EU and a final deal that will be good for the whole country.“But our willingness to compromise is not without limits. We are leaving the European Union in fact, not just in name. If we can’t obtain a deal that secures that objective…  an attempt is made to lock us in via the back door of the EEA and customs union… or  the only offer from the EU threatens the integrity of our Union. Then we will be left with no choice but to leave without a deal.”Former Brexit secretary Mr Davis, who quit Mrs May’s Cabinet along with Mr Johnson in protest at the Chequers plan, was dismissive of a series of policy suggestions from the pretender to the Tory leadership. “I think one of the blights of British politics is politicians having fantastic ideas that cost a fortune and don’t do much good,” Mr Davis told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday.“Quite a lot of his ideas, I think, are good headlines but not necessarily good policies.”Mr Davis confirmed he would vote against Chequers  it came before the House of Commons in its current form, but rejected Labour suggestions that defeat for Mrs May at the hands of Tory rebels would collapse the Government.“I will vote against Chequers, full stop, and it won’t lead to a general election,” he said.“We are capable of managing this through.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do.

Building methods change along with building materials.

Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in 2018, having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.\nAfter a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on 29 minutes, and never looked back.\nEvan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from 20 yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.\nGreg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.\nNewtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.\nThe second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the 90 minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.\nSeconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.\nWhen Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.\nNewtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of 48, was his first final.\nMacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.\nHe said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.\n“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”\nLovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.\n“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parry  from Gairloch, Ian MacLeod  from Inverness, and 75-year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a Lucky2Bhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.\nOn Saturday 9th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!\n“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”\nCherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.\nHaving battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”\nDespite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of Lucky2Bhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like Lucky2Bhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be here  it wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”\n\nThree days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday 12th June, 52-year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.\n“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took 40 to 50 minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”\nAfter being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.\nHaving served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”\nDuring his 13 years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”\n\n\nOn Wednesday 13th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, 76-year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.\n“John hadn’t been 100 per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was 75 — to take it easy, so we came home\u0026#8230 We went to bed about 11 o’clock.”\n“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”\nCarol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled 999 and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.\n“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about 10 years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”\nJohn was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.\n“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”\nCarol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.\n“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”\nDr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by Lucky2Bhere is “truly le-saving”.\n“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every 90 seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by 10 per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.\n\u0026#8220The approach taken by Lucky2Bhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”\nEstablished in 2007, Lucky2Bhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in 2006 but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.\nIn view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – Lucky2Bhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across the  and breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.\nLast year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all 24 primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently 115 public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than 50 across Skye.\nRoss Cowie said: “We always said at Lucky2Bhere that  we could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.\n“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\n\nLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturday  with the 2018 Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.\nThis season\u0026#8217s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on 39 points in the table \u0026#8211 as goal dference isn\u0026#8217t factored in.\nMallaig secured their place in tomorrow\u0026#8217s showdown after recording a fantastic 4-3 away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.\nKyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved 4-1 home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.\nWith the teams having scored 168 goals between them in the league this season \u0026#8211 *including 14 in their three encounters so far, Saturday\u0026#8217s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.\n\n\n\nHaving gone from 2-1 up to 3-2 down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.\n\nMallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell\u0026#8217s side.\nJust as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor\u0026#8217 side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.\n\nWith only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s men.\nRoss Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side 4-2 ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.\nWith less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon\u0026#8217s effort and with it seal his side\u0026#8217s playoff berth.\n\n\nAfter succumbing to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting 2-0 win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts\u0026#8217 unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.\nIn stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before \u0026#8211 which saw him earn a red card \u0026#8211 Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.\n\nThe south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.\nKyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a platform to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.\n\nWith Mallaig having finished the season on 39 points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher\u0026#8217s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.\nWhat followed was a fine team performance by the 2017 winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson \u0026#8211 including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half.\n\n\n \u0026#8220I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8220The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have only  one defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.\u0026#8221\nI don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig \u0026#8211 so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week.

partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards

the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a

Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who

changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew

have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €60. \nLike Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. \nIf the film ‘Black 47’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the 1790s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In 1861 the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘Kilkenny  Moderator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:\n“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” \nThe recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.\nStudents of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. \nThe book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of 1,000 rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties 1865-92’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. \nThis is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview \n Ruairí Doyle\n\n“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TD\nSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. \nHe also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. \nSpeaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.\nThe Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the 1980’s. \nThis informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, even  it were 40 or 50 years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.\nPearse, who has been a TD since 2010, talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. \nThe Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. \nHe said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,  I am in thatposition.”\nSinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.\nPearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. \nThis is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”\nHe continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €2.5 billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”\nAs Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.\nDeputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  \n“What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  \n“It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”\nTouching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the 26 Counties.\nPearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. \nHe continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  \n“And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”\nSinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. \nThis Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. \nTeachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athome  that’s what they wish.” \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"happiest places in northern ireland revealed and the most miserable","story":"                \nScores were produced for council area by the Office of National Statistics  based on four measures of personal well-being - le satisfaction, feeling that the things done in le are worthwhile, happiness and anxiety.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHealth, employment and relationship status are key determinants of personal well-being according to previous research done by the ONS.

McWilliam Gallery \u0026amp Studio\u0027s 10th anniversary are  Millie Moore , Dr Riann Coulter  and Roger Wilson .\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“McWilliam’s work remains the key attraction within our artistic programme and we complement our outstanding collection of his work with at least four major modern and contemporary exhibitions every year.”\n\nOver a decade, the gallery has hosted hugely popular exhibitions from some of Europe’s most celebrated artists including William Scott, Basil Blackshaw, Rita Duffy, Margaret Clarke, Susan MacWilliam and, recently, Neil Shawcross. Local groups including Banbridge Camera Club, Banbridge Art Club and local schools and colleges have also had the opportunity to exhibit at the gallery, ensuring its popularity with local visitors and supporters.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThere also big plans ahead, with a major exhibition of Scottish art from the Fleming Wyfold Collection scheduled for summer 2019. An exciting collaboration with the British Museum is already under way too, in addition to plans for a unique exhibition of award-winning works from the internationally celebrated local contemporary painter Colin Davidson.\n\nLord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Cllr Julie Flaherty, said: “With a stunning sculpture garden and an authentic recreation of McWilliam’s studio, we’re delighted and proud to celebrate a decade of work, commitment and success and look forward to the many more great things ahead. We’d like to thank everyone for their patronage and loyalty to the gallery and look forward to seeing faces old and new in this celebratory year.”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nPresent and past serving staff at the F.E. McWilliam Gallery \u0026amp Studio at the 10th anniversary celebrations.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nOne of the gallery’s closest collaborations has been with its cross-border partner, Highlanes Gallery, Drogheda. Jointly funded through East Border Region Interreg funding, the two galleries have both become established as leading visual arts venues and are currently working on a new, joint exhibition for November 2018 which features work by top international artists from the Arts Council Collection, London and National Museums Northern Ireland.\n\nF.E. McWilliam Gallery and Studio also incorporates an award-winning restaurant – Quails Café – which adds huge weight to its appeal as a major cultural and hospitality destination which can be shared with family, friends and colleagues.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTo celebrate its 10th year, the F.E. McWilliam Studio and Gallery is presenting two very special exhibitions, both of which run until November 10.\n\nLucienne Day: Living Design Celebrating the le and work of one of most influential designers of the post-war generation, Lucienne Day, and tells the story of her thrilling design career, unfolding in a sequence of photographs drawn from the archives of the Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation.

People will go as a community to worship, they’ll move about each others churches. We thought this year we’d put the church back in the centre of it.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nOf the newly built church, he said: “It’s a bit of a step up from a teddy bear but we have a willing band of workers, so fair play to them for putting this together. \n\n“There was probably about a dozen people of all ages working on it. It took them a day and half to put it on site but they been working at it before that, preparing the windows and things like that.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nMinister of Rathfriland Presbyterian Church Rev Trevor Boyd\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“You’ve got people involved in the painting, there’s farmers involved with their telehandlers, supplying the straw and putting it into place.\n\n“It’s a relevant way to connect with people, to get their interest and to highlight to them that it’s harvest time and that there’s an opportunity to thank God for the harvest in First Rathfriland.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nOf the structure, which is located around half a mile from the church, Rev Boyd said: “There’s been quite a draw to it, as in other years. People come to it to have their photos taken. People look forward to seeing what’s going to be on the site.\n\n“This year with Storm Ali it was a wee bit later. People thought maybe nothing was going up this year, but we didn’t want to put it up and lose it in the storm, so we waited.”\n\nThe Harvest Thanksgiving services take place on Sunday, October 7 at 11.30am and 7pm.\n\nRev Boyd added: “Our church building will also be open from 3pm to 6pm for the whole community to look at the displays, listen to live music and enjoy some apple tart.”\n\n

places in northern ireland revealed and the most miserable","story":"                \nScores were produced for council area by the Office of National Statistics  based on four measures of personal

Another option is to present changes in personal well-being over time within the same local authority area, identying signicant changes.\n\n\nWider findings\n\n\nThe report found that the happiest place to live in the UK is apparently an area of north-east Hampshire called Rushmoor, which scored 8.35 out of 10.

Written by Stephen Large and directed by the multi-talented Martin Lynch, Three’s A Shroud examines the funny side of Belfast’s undertaking business and transforms the not so funny subject of death and religious rivalry into a barrel of laughs.\nFor years, veteran undertaker Gerry McSorley  has buried only Catholics. “They bury theirs, we bury ours,” he says simply.\nMcSorley’s assistant is Poleglass lad Simon Doherty . Simon is a wannabe rapper who’s in the wrong job, because quite simply he’s disgusted at the very thought of preparing dead bodies for a funeral. The relationship between the two is fascinating and hilarious at the same time.\nAs the battle for business intensies, Simon comes up with new and inventive ways of bringing Gerry’s business into the 21st century through the use of Facebook, an app to allow clients to track their loved ones from the morgue and live-streaming funeral services. His ideas and imagination are endless.\nFuneral traditions go out the window when young Protestant undertaker Basil Gray , who is more interested in courting widowed customers, comes along after taking over his late father’s business.\nA special mention to Shaun for his acting out of famous movie scenes from ‘The Godfather’ to ‘Scarface’ whilst preparing bodies – it’s genius, and perhaps worth a play in itself.\nBasil decides to break traditions, sparking a tit-for-tat rivalry between him and McSorley. It’s at this point Gerry turns to the Belfast  and News Letter for some Protestant customers.\nA hilarious mix-up of ‘Here Lies A Soldier’ and the ‘Soldier’s Song’ at McSorley’s first attempt at a Protestant funeral spells the end of that.\nThe undertaking war then takes an unexpected twist as the rivals are caught cold by the introduction of a half-price, new-age, interdenominational funeral service, managed by young Polish woman Irena Bukowski .\n“Typical,” says Gerry McSorley, “coming over here taking our dead bodies” in one of many unforgettable lines in the comedy.\nIrena’s new funeral service proves hugely popular in an age of austerity, forcing the Catholic and Protestant undertakers to put their rivalry aside to attempt to win back their customers,  abandoning the usuns against themuns’ policy.\nAfter a high profile republican and loyalist  are killed, the three rival undertakers are forced together as one in a desperate bid to avoid the paramilitaries and, yes, death. Disaster surely beckons, or can they work together and dodge a bullet? I will say no more.\nThree’s a Shroud is full of classic lewd, crude, rude and standard yet classic ‘Norn Iron’ humour that is expertly delivered by the impressive cast.\nThe play sees the actors skilfully play multiple roles, with a special mention for McGowan, who doubles up as Gerry’s cleaner, known for her hilariously foul-mouthed banter.\nSpike, the UVF’s ‘community donations collector,  and Gusty Stitt’s son are wonderfully played also.\nThree’s A Shroud reminds us of three things: we love to be offended, le is short and we are better united than ided.\nThe play is tribute to the rise of writer Stephen Large, who has shot to fame after creating the very funny Dundonald Liberation Army  page on Facebook, gaining 30,000 followers in no time.\nAs for GBL Productions and Martin Lynch, what more can you say in praise and admiration of one of the north’s most successful playwrights?\nI can’t recommend this hilarious comedy enough.\n\n\nThree’s A Shroud is at the Waterfront Hall until October 6. Tickets are available by calling 028 9033 4455, online at www.waterfront and at the Box Office at the Ulster Hall.\n\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"time for truth campaign travel to stormont","story":"\nTHE Time for Truth campaign travelled to Stormont yesterday and submitted 6000 responses to the NIO’s consultation, Addressing the Legacy of the Past in the North, during a meeting with NIO Deputy Director Chris Flatt.\n\nMr Flatt is overseeing the legacy consultation. The campaign also took the opportunity to highlight their campaign objectives: raising awareness of the Time for Truth advice clinics across Belfast on Saturday, September 29 and working to see  institutions for dealing with the past up and running.\n\nCampaign spokesman Ciarán MacAirt said: “We were very grateful for the time that the Deputy Director of the NIO took to listen to the families of the Time for Truth campaign. After handing over 6000 responses to the legacy consultation, we discussed how we supported the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement in full and the proper resourcing of the coronial inquest system and Office of Police Ombudsman.”\n\n“We also told Mr Flatt that we planned to gather even more responses before the close of the consultation on 5th of October, especially during the advice clinics we are running across Belfast on Saturday to support any citizens who wish to respond.\n\n“We were also keen to discuss how long after the consultation closes that our families will see the British state’s response to the consultation, its passing of appropriate legislation at Westminster, and the structures in place and working. Although we want to ensure that the work is done properly, unlike it was in the past, families have longer to wait for any prospect of truth and justice under the proposed mechanisms, so the proper resourcing of the legacy inquests and the Office of the Police Ombudsman could help begin the process now. Any other delay will see the families of the Time for Truth campaign take to the streets as we did in February of this year when 7000 victims and survivors, friends and supporters joined our March for Truth.” \n"},{"url":null,"title":"a long drive home for armagh familys","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

He\u0027s always tinkered and restored cars and I wanted to help him. I guess this was my apprenticeship,\" said the 26-year-old nurse from Middletown.\n\nMandy and her dad spent weekend after weekend lovingly restoring the car over the past four years.\n\n\"We just started it as a weekend project. We both work full-time, so it was a hobby for both of us,\" she said.\n\n\"My dad has always tinkered with cars but we took on quite a lot with this one. However, looking at it now, there\u0027s no way I\u0027d ever part with it. It has a lot of sentimental value.\"\n\nThe Cortina caused quite a stir as Mandy, husband Justin Gormley, Robert and mum Jessica made their way through the Continent on the 3,350-mile road trip. \n\nThe family spent a lot of their spare time posing for photographs. \n\nThe Cortina was even commandeered for a photoshoot by a model agency in Paris.\n\n\"The whole experience made us feel pretty cool,\" added Mandy.\n\n\"Once the Cortina got through the MoT in June we decided we\u0027d go for it. We turned it into our family holiday, though we had to load the boot up with a lot of spare parts just in case, as we weren\u0027t really sure  our work on the car would last the pace.\n\n\"We thought about driving straight to Cortina and back again, but it was too good an opportunity to waste, so we planned the trip to take in a lot of the sights all of us wanted to see around Europe. It all went so well and we might plan another one.\"\n\nApart from the UK, the car passed through the Republic, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy, Austria, Slovenia and Monaco.\n\n\"We\u0027ve been through the Black Forest, driven across the Millau Viaduct in southern France, the highest bridge in the world, and around the famous Stelvio Pass in the north of Italy with its 49 hairpin bends,\" said Mandy.\n\n\"When we arrived in Cortina D\u0027Ampezzo in Italy the locals were amazed to see the car. \n\n\"There are not that many of them still around, and even fewer managed to make it back to the town they were named after.\"\n\nBack in 1964 a new Ford Cortina would have completed around 32 miles to the gallon, but Mandy said she wanted to make the car as economical as possible.\n\n\"You could say I had a trip like this in the back of my mind when we put a diesel engine in it, and in the end we were getting up to 62mpg, so that was well worth it considering how far we\u0027ve managed to travel in it.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast international airport apology after chaotic delays at security checks","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

One user joked it would soon be quicker to drive to Dublin than get through the airport\u0027s security.\n\nIt\u0027s thought bottlenecks occur because of people arriving at the airport too early for their flight while others show up at the advised time leading to more passengers than expected arriving at one time. \n\nThe airport took to the social network to remind people to arrive at least two hours before departure.\n\n\"Carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security,\" it tweeted.\n\nA spokeswoman added: \"We apologise to any passengers who suffered delays as a result of queues at security this morning.

And last Monday the airport blamed equipment failure for long delays though its security.\n\nMichael Smyth - a union official for Nautlilus International which represents ferry workers - arrived early at the airport for his flight to Liverpool for his organisation\u0027s annual conference.\n\nHe is a regular flyer visiting many of the UK\u0027s ious ports. He said he queued for an hour on Monday and while he made his flight with time to spare he said others turned back in the queue saying they had missed theirs.\n\n\"The queue was all the way down the escalator,\" he said.\n\n\"I just couldn\u0027t understand it as all the lines were open and they were processing everyone at a fair rate. It was not like it was going slow, it was just the sheer volume of people trying to get through.\n\n\"And by the time I got through it all the queue was just the same . It was a nightmare.\"\n\nHe added: \"We went away for our holidays in the summer and had a 40 minute queue then. But you expect that over the Twelfth fortnight not at the beginning of October when it is mainly just commuters.\n\n\"The thing that really got me today was there was no one giving advice or even helping people who were about to miss their flights. There were some asking to get past to catch a flight and people were letting them through, but there needed to be better assistance.\"\n\n\"Had I missed my flight I would have missed important meetings today.\"\n\nThe airport pledged to end long delays after it announced a new company would be taking over the handling of security. Wilson James will take over security operations on November 1.\n\nBelfast International Airport urged passengers to be prepared for security checks before arriving at the airport to speed the process along.\n\n\"Adhering to these guidelines and carrying only essential items in hand luggage can help reduce the need for manual checks at security, which can quickly cause queues to build up,\" the spokeswoman added.\n\n\nThe airport\u0027s guidelines include: \n\n\n\nEnsuring hand luggage is not densely packed\n\nAll non-essential liquids are packed in hold baggage\n\nAny liquids brought through security must be in a 1l resealable plastic bag \n\nAll laptops, tablets etc must be removed from  hand luggage \n\nRemove all coats, belts etc\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"former ireland rugby captain brian odriscoll proud after attending twelfth event","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

not pulled off,\" he said last night.\n\nArron explained he had been trying to build up his flock, but now another of his sheep has lambed early because of what he believes is trauma.\n\nThe lorry driver said he was keeping the horric story from his two young children - a son and daughter aged seven and six respectively - as it was too disturbing.\n\nHe described those behind the grim attack as \"total scum to do this to an innocent animal\", which he believed would have suffered.\n\n\"How anyone could do this to an animal is beyond me,\" he said. \n\n\"Someone knew what they were doing.\n\n\"This wasn\u0027t a five minute job.\n\n\"It wasn\u0027t a pretty sight to come across this morning,\" he added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"psni launch recruitment drive for","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It was woven in Scotland and it’s called a viyella.\n\n\"It’s from a certain era you wouldn’t see it so much now, I think it’s a 1970s dress.\n\n\"I didn’t realise what was in the pocket until I tried it on at home and then I found the locket.\"\n\n\nHey \n#Dublin\n: I bought this vintage dress from the Oxfam on Aungier Street. Once I got home, I found a precious locket in the pocket. I’m sure someone is missing this. If you recognize, I’d love to find the owner! \n#Ireland\n \npic.twitter/oSZiZzO1tH\n\n— Fiona Leahy  \nSeptember 27, 2018\n\n\n\n\nFiona posted a photo online of both the dress and the locket and although she has had some famous retweeters like Laura Whitmore and Jenny Gibney, she is yet to learn any information as to the owner of what she presumes is a sentimental object.\n\n\"I haven’t had any leads on somebody that would own it,\" she said.\n\n\"People are just suggesting where I should post it or who to get involved but I haven’t had anybody that recognised it.\n\n\"It seems like it was probably owned by an elderly lady because it is an outdated dress so I think it would be an elderly Irish lady.\"\n\nWhile Fiona feels that the locket is probably not valuable she said that it has a vintage appeal to it and she is desperate to find its owner, who may think the piece of jewellery precious.\n\nAnd although the dress is \"terribly huge\", she\u0027s not ready to part with it.\n\n\"It’s silver the front of it has some kind of design on it,\" she said of the locket.\n\n\"The inside is tarnished silver. It looks very old the picture in it is colourised though. I feel like  it was fake silver it would tarnishing green that would be my experience but it looks oxidised.\n\n\"I genuinely would like to find the owner. They can keep the locket but I want to keep the dress. That’s the deal.\"\n\nWhen Fiona, who only moved to Ireland from LA in April, was 10 years old she managed to reunite a high school ring with its owner so she is confident that the same can be achieved with the silver locket.\n\nIf you have any information about the owner of the locket please contact Fiona on her Twitter @hellofionaleahy\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein alternative budget includes 5 euro social welfare","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We want to increase services by opening up hospital beds and recruiting 1,500 more staff.\n\n“We have provided to deal with the overruns and the issue of retention of key staff because we aren’t paying them enough to attract them and stop them moving to England or elsewhere.”\n\nOther measures include pay equality for post-2011 public sector workers, increasing Disability Allowance by 9 euro, tripling funding to the Rape Crisis Centre, withdrawal of private school subsidy, and a wage cut for politicians.\n\nThe party also proposes the development of “One-Stop-Shop Brexit Assistance Clinics” for small businesses to deal with any fallout from the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"wait wait he screamed ryanair passenger tackled to ground making late dash across tarmac at dublin airport","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Please follow the below link to our website, where you can find a more detailed update.... \nhttps:t.co/lBZZA7YKcH\n\n— Cairngorm Mountain  \nOctober 1, 2018\n\n\n\n\nCairngorm Mountain Limited  said the closure will have “serious implications” for its commercial operation.\n\nCML chief operating officer Ewan Kearney said: “As operators of such a unique visitor attraction as the funicular, we take our responsibility and duty of care to the public and our staff extremely seriously.\n\n“It is in everybody’s best interests to close the funicular to allow the engineers to conduct their investigation. Our priority is to get a clear picture of any faults with the funicular in order to develop a course of action that addresses these concerns.\n\n“Rest assured, we do not underestimate the signicance of this situation to the entire local area, including our own employees, and are working to resolve this situation quickly and safely, for the future benefit of all mountain visitors.\n\n“At this stage, we are unable to provide a detailed timeline for the reopening of the funicular and will issue further updates as we are able to do so.”\n\nSusan Smith, Highlands and Islands Enterprise head of business development, said: “This is a highly regrettable situation, over which we have very limited control.\n\n“Clearly it will have a considerable impact on the commercial operations on Cairn Gorm, and be of concern to those employed at the resort. Our thoughts are very much with them as well as those who use the mountain and its facilities.\n\n“We are treating this as extremely urgent and doing all we can to address the problem and have the funicular ed to full service as quickly as possible.\n\n“In the meantime, safety must come first and we fully respect CML’s decision to act on the precautionary advice of the inspectors.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say october","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

You can go back to that a day later and make sense of it? You can both watch the action and write all that? I am. im. pressed.\n— Justin Bourne  \nSeptember 29, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nblake are you okay\n— martin rickman  \nSeptember 29, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives me anxiety\n— Mike Zavagno  \nSeptember 29, 2018\n\n\n\n\nSo, how does Blake’s shorthand work?\n\n“The actual shorthand is pretty simple,” he said. “Player initials for players, X or check for miss or make, time and score updates. \n\n“The ones that confused people are probably play-call notes like ‘dk’ for a drive and kick or ‘Pr’ for a pick-and-roll, or situation notes like ‘ato’ or after a time-out or ‘slob’ for a sideline out of bounds.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“There are some other ones too – who is defending whom, what lineup is out, etc – but mostly it’s just the players involved in the action and what the action was.”\n\nSome on Twitter pointed out that there might be easier ways for Blake to take notes of the action as it happens, but he prefers his way.\n\n\nThey have these things called computers these days that let you take notes and format things in such a way that they’re legible.\n— Jeff Siegel  \nSeptember 29, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nI like this way.\n— Blake Murphy  \nSeptember 29, 2018\n\n\n\n\nBlake added that the notes help him when it comes to re-watching match footage, by allowing him to quickly find the plays that were of interest in the game.\n\nAll in all though, it’s about preference. \n\n“I fully realise it looks silly and it’s entirely unnecessary to take detailed hand notes in 2018,” said Blake. “It’s just a comfort thing that I’ve grown to like doing while I watch.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch dramatic footage taken from the centre of tropical storm rosa in arizona","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There is a political group that wants women, and other people, to believe that they are victims.”\n\nNoting the suspension, Mr Strumia lashed out at the Geneva centre, but expressed hope that it would come around to his way of thinking.\n\n“I believe Cern is making a mistake,” he said. “They suspended me because it’s true … and it’s contrary to the political line. And I hope Cern will at some point understand. I hope this is just the first self-preservation instinct.\n\n“Somebody had to speak.”\n\nLaura Covi, who studies cosmology at Georg-August University in Goettingen, Germany, and was at the Friday seminar, said Mr Strumia’s comments did not go down well.\n\n\n\nI don\u0027t think he represents the majority view. There were a few men who were there but they didn\u0027t support his view\nLaura Covi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n“He was claiming that some of the positions women were getting, they’re getting positions with fewer  citations than men,” she said. “I’m not so sure his thesis was supported by the data.”\n\nShe acknowledged that some of the world’s most eminent physicists have been men, but said that was “mostly a historical bias” since men have been able to study physics longer than women.\n\nShe also disputed that citations are an indicator of quality and said it was not her experience that female physicists landed jobs with fewer journal publications than men.\n\nMs Covi said Mr Strumia has frequently made provocative comments in the past and said after his presentation that he was challenged by many at the seminar — so much so that the chair had to abruptly end the session when it ran over.\n\n“People were upset by what he was saying.

There were a few men who were there but they didn’t support his view.”\n\nDr Julie Moote of University College London, who had spoken earlier in the seminar, said it was a “shame” Mr Strumia “did not engage” with evidence from other presenters — including her research with more than 40,000 young people in England and interviews over time with youths aged 10 to 18.\n\n“Findings show that young women do experience sexism in physics — from being told by a teacher that ‘you need a boy brain to do physics’, to survey data showing that boys feel they are encouraged more by their physics teachers than girls — which leads to a situation where even some of the highest attaining young women were doubting that they were ‘clever enough’ to do physics,” Dr Moote said.\n\nCern is currently headed by a woman, Italian particle physicist Fabiola Gianotti.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry family lost much loved pet donate 1000 local","story":"\nA Derry family whose beloved pet was mauled to death have donated £1,000 to local animal charities and praised the support and generosity of their community after the traumatic event.\n\nThe city was shocked by the story of Ozzy, a much-loved family pet, who was mauled for almost an hour as his 63-year-old owner looked on terried and helpless.\n\nMarie Doherty had been taking her three-year-old shih tzu, Ozzy, a walk in Bishop’s Field Park in July when he was viciously attacked by two large dogs that were not on a leash.\n\nLittle Ozzy was rushed to the vet and survived for a couple of days after losing his leg but, sadly, lost his fight for le.\n\nDerry City and Strabane District Council confirmed in the wake of the attack that the two dogs responsible, who they described as a ‘Staffordshire Bulldog type’, had been euthanised.\n\nSpeaking to the Derry News, Michael, Marie’s son, who arrived at the scene after the attack and took Ozzy to the vet, said that the local community and one neighbour in particular had shown the family tremendous support and generosity following the shocking attack.\n\n“Our neighbour, Catherine Higgins, was there in the park the night it happened and she set up a Go Fund Me page to pay for the vet’s bill, which came to £1,100,” he said.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“We wanted to give a special word of thanks to Catherine for what she did for my mum, she came up to visit her afterwards too.”\n\nMichael said that there was £1,000 left over from the money donated by the local community and that the family felt it was only right to donate it to local animal charities.\n\n“Given the nature of what happened, we wanted to donate the leftover money to the Rainbow Rehoming Centre and Pet FBI,” he said.\n\n“We really want to thank the local community for their generosity and support it just blew us all away.”\n\nMichael said that Marie is considering getting another dog for companionship but still misses little Ozzy.\n\n“We will know when the time is right she needs a bit of time after what happened but I know the right wee dog will come along for her,” he added.\n\n\nPictured above: Marie with her much-loved pet, little Ozzy, and Marie and Michael presenting Caroline at the Rainbow Rehoming Centre with a cheque for £500.

In Downpatrick, 335 are on the waiting list, with 227 in urgent need.\n\nLast year, a total of 95 social homes were allocated in both towns, with the Executive confirming work is currently underway to build 30 new homes in Newcastle and 37 in Downpatrick as part of the first phase of the redevelopment of the former Downe Hospital site.\n\nThe waiting list figures were outlined at Monday night\u0026rsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, with politicians saying they are acutely aware of the pressure on housing officials to meet increasing need.\n\nThey say they are willing to do all they can to help and hope land can be secured to build more social homes to help reduce waiting list numbers.

Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth has labelled the behaviour of Lord Melchett as \u0026ldquodisgraceful and called for immediate action.\n\nThe furore centres around a five year-old girl whose father wants her to attend a state controlled school in Dundrum or Castlewellan. However, because she lives in the country outside Castlewellan she would need to have school minibus transport provided for her.\n\nAccording to Mrs Smyth, she has been told by the South Eastern Education and Library Board that the child will have to go to a maintained school in Annsborough which would exclude the need for transport arrangements.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe child\u0026rsquos father wants her to go to a controlled school and he is entitled to have her do so, Mrs Smyth said. \u0026ldquoI am thoroughly disgusted and I think that the Department of Education must be totally inefficient  they don\u0026rsquot answer within a month.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash There just seems to be no stopping the Downpatrick supergroup Rosetta Stone, who recently completed another dynamic tour of Japan and will be setting off on a trip to Thailand later this year.\n\nThe five members of the group \u0026mdash Damien, Terry and Colin McKee, Andy LeGear and Ian Mitchell \u0026mdash are just back from their second conquering trip to Japan where their latest hit, Sheila, is currently number one.\n\nIn the last year the band have been playing constantly across the globe and have built up a huge following in many countries, including Germany and Canada. But it has been in Japan that Rosetta Stone have really shot to stardom.\n\nThis was one of the first countries which the band visited after its formation and it became clear from the start that the young Irish lads obviously had something which appealed to Japanese girls.\n\nAt the end of their first Japanese tour each member of the group received a gold disc for mass sales of their LP, Rock Pictures, and their first two singles also thundering into the Japanese charts.\n\nNow they have gone and taken Japan by storm again where they are playing to crowds of between 11,000 and 15,000 twice a day.\n\nKILCLIEF \u0026mdash Strangford police have appealed to the public to help them trace keys which were stolen from a car on Saturday.\n\nThe car, a Chrysler Hillman Minx, had been parked in a field at Kilclief between 1.30 and 2pm while\u0026nbsp Mr John McMullan, of Drumroe Road, was working. When he arrived back at the vehicle an ignition key and a boot key had ben taken.\n\nPolice in Strangford have since been informed that a children\u0026rsquos sponsored walk was passing through the area at the time and they have appealed to parents to ask the children who took part  they know anything about the theft.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash A burning interest in art has led Newcastle couple Margaret and Gerry Grant into an unusual project \u0026mdash the opening of a new art gallery in their own home.\n\nWith over 200 paintings and sculptures of their own they have opened the gallery in an extension to their Bryansford Road house.\n\nBut it isn\u0026rsquot only for the fun of it. The Grants will be buying and selling works and promoting exhibitions. Already they have lined up an autumn show with exhibits from a Spanish painter and an Italian sculptor.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are aiming at the professional rather than the amateur, Mrs Grant said. \u0026ldquoOur main aim is to share our interest in art, but we do see the commercial and promotional sides to it.\n\n\u0026ldquoReally there is a wide range of work on show. My husband and I have been interested in art for a long time.\n\nDUNDRUM \u0026mdash A phantom clothes line thief has struck again \u0026mdash this time in Dundrum. The thief, who has been confining his acts to the Newcastle and Dundrum area, struck during the night at a house on the Dromara Road.\n\nA considerable number of children\u0026rsquos clothes were taken from the line, making it a profitable night for the thief.\n\nPolice in Dundrum and Newcastle are anxious to catch the thief, who must have a considerable wardrobe stocked up by now. Anyone with information or who sees anyone acting suspiciously around houses at night should contact them immediately.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash Plans for a new primary school in Killinchy have brought a \u0026rsquono go\u0026rsquo sign from local residents. In a petition to the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the residents of Ardview Park have expressed serious concern about the plans.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos not the building of the school they object to, but rather the fact that access to the site will be off Ardview Park. They say they are concerned about traffic which will be using the road, both during the construction of the school and when it is opened.\n\nTheir petition was recently shown to members of the Board\u0026rsquos Finance Committee. Afterwards it was agreed to set up a special sub-committee to visit the school and report back on the plans.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash A Ballygowan housewe will be one of eight ladies who will be taking part in the national finals of the Cook of the Realm contest.

The top prize is valued at more than \u0026pound4,000.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Ardglass boxer Ray Ross has been offered a wonderful chance to make an impact on the British lightweight scene.\n\nEvery since he lost a close decision to Charlie Nash for the Irish title two years ago, the 28 year-old slugger has shown indferent form. But now the Ardglass golf course greenskeeper has a chance to make the top before he runs out of fight time and interest.\n\nRoss has been matched with the experienced Jonnie Elliott, of Bournemouth, over eight rounds at Maysfield Leisure Centre in Belfast on October 11 and a win would hoist Ross up the lightweight ladder and on to bigger punch for paydays.\n\nRay is part of a big British title fight night involving Antrim southpaw Jim Montague against Clinton McKenzie for the vacant light welterweight title.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Kilclief in full flow as ‘Fin are bottled up  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA RESILIENT Kilclief outfit produced a rousing second half display to shatter Aughlisnafin\u0026rsquos championship dreams at St Colman\u0026rsquos Park, Drumaness, on Saturday.\n\nDespite going into the break only 0-6 to 0-4 down, Kilclief were staring down the barrel of an ignoble defeat after losing the influential Louis McMullan and James McGrath to early black cards.\n\nTo make matters even worse, they also lost the talismanic Ciaran Sloan to a hamstring injury and almost down to the bare bones, they looked vulnerable and there for the taking.\n\nHowever, led brilliantly by Aiden McCann and Eoin King they took the game to Aughlisnafin with a swagger and sparkle that Willie Megoran\u0026rsquos side were unable to contain.\n\nAughlisnafin were impressively out of the traps first.

The all-weather leboat under coxswain William Chambers launched within minutes into the middle of Storm Ali as it unleashed its devastating power.\n\nThe challenging weather conditions the crew was going to face en route to Newtownards were immediately apparent after launch, with the coxswain requesting the closure of main water tight doors as the vessel was battered by eight metre high waves.\n\nA Force 8 gale was blowing as the crew approached Strangford Lough some 90 minutes after the seas started to settle as the leboat was sheltered by the shore.\n\nOn arrival at the yacht club, the Coastguard was concerned that there may be a person on board the weather beaten vessel, but it was subsequently confirmed there wasn\u0026rsquot.\n\nThe leboat was then requested to go the aid of another yacht drting across the lough from Whiterock and Kircubbin. Unfortunately, by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.\n\nAs the leboat made her  journey to Newcastle and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.\n\nThe  to Newcastle was another hazardous journey as the crew battled mountainous seas, forcing the vessel to stop at Ardglass marina for an hour to allow the storm force wind to ease and the waves to decrease. The leboat left the marina at 6pm, ing home one hour later.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was a challenging day for our volunteers given that we launched into rough seas when Storm Ali was at its worst, said Coxswain William Chambers when safely back ashore. \u0026ldquoOur volunteers are highly skilled and trained for these situations and were delighted to be able to help.\n\nSome of the largest trees to fall victim to last weekend\u0026rsquos storm have been a prominent landmark in Castlewellan\u0026rsquos Lower Square for generations.\n\nSlieve Croob councillor Ro\u0026iacutes\u0026iacuten Howell believes the location of the fallen trees should be the future home of the town\u0026rsquos permanent Christmas tree.\n\n\u0026ldquoLike many other residents who have grown up in the area their whole le, I was saddened to see these two great trees blow down.

The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.\u0026nbsp\n\nSenior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.\u0026nbsp\n\nDuring the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland  presented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.\n\nLocal authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent platform to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.\n\nIn addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.\n\nSince March last year, the local authority\u0026rsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.\u0026nbsp\n\nGeoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.\n\nSecuring the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos tourism strategy.\n\nThe current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.\n\nThe local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.\u0026nbsp\n\nOfficials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the area\u0026rsquos signicant geological and other heritage.\n\nThere are currently 127 geoparks found in 35 countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.\n\nHowever, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurther information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/8715069.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"\n\n  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper \nStratton\n  \n    THE.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.
