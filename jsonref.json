This was set up by her mother Slavica Ecclestone —Bernie\u0027s former wife — in 1997 and raised £3 billion by selling shares in Formula One.Slavica and her daughters, Tamara and Petra, are the beneficiaries of the trust.The three women have been made so wealthy by the trust that Slavica — who orced Bernie in 2008 — blew £12 million on Petra\u0027s wedding to first husband, James Stunt.And there is nothing that goes down quite so well on Instagram as monumental excess.Tamara habitually shows off the fruits of her unfettered spending on social media, including a lavish £150,000 birthday party in June at which naked cowboys served tequila shots.There was speculation yesterday that her status as the blingiest woman in London might have made her a target for raiders, alerted to her leaving the property hours earlier when she posted pictures of her family aboard a private jet en route to Lapland.But friends insist the robbery is not connected to social media. \u0027I don\u0027t think it\u0027s got anything to do with her posting a picture of getting on a jet,\u0027 said the source.Be that as it may, father Bernie has been repeatedly dismayed by his flashy daughters — and their flashy husbands.The son of a Suffolk trawlerman, the 89-year-old former chief executive of Formula One is a workaholic and has no time for ostentation. His favourite meal remains egg on toast with brown sauce and, when they were growing up, his daughters didn\u0027t have a nanny or housekeeper.Bernie built up his fortune during his 40-year reign over world motorsport. In 2017, U.S. giant Liberty Media completed its £6.4 billion takeover of the sport, and Bernie was appointed chairman emeritus.Over the years, the Ecclestone family has fallen victim to numerous criminals. Bernie was mugged in 2010 on a London street, with £200,000 of jewellery taken.In 2016, his mother-in-law was kidnapped in Sao Paulo, Brazil, but released ten days later without any ransom being paid.Daughter Petra had jewellery worth £450,000 taken in 2013 from her house in Belgravia by a burglar posing as a prospective home buyer. He was later sentenced to eight years in prison.Meanwhile, the men in the lives of Tamara and Petra have also had brushes with the law.Jay Rutland, a former City trader who works for an art gallery, was accused in 2016 of helping a fugitive drugs baron — serious allegations that could have landed him in jail for up to seven years had the charges not been dropped for lack of evidence. Mr Rutland strenuously denied the allegations.         Husband Jay was in a less ecclesiastical mood, opting for a more pointed barb on the social media site which seemed to imply he knew who was behind the raid: \u0027I know u are lying, but continue\u0027 Three days after returning from their honeymoon in June, 2013, he was robbed at knifepoint at a petrol station in East London and had his £50,000 Rolex watch and a £20,000 gold bracelet stolen.Meanwhile, Petra\u0027s first husband James Stunt has been accused by Petra of being a fantasist and an art fraudster. Stunt, from Surrey, is a bullion dealer and art collector and his godfather is Terry Adams, the convicted money launderer and alleged gangster.Now bankrupt, Stunt told police he was the victim of a £90 million heist in his Belgravia home in 2017.But officers closed the investigation months later and no arrests have been made.Last month, open hostilities broke out between Petra — now engaged to former car salesman Sam Palmer — and Stunt.Petra married Stunt in 2011 and they had three children before orcing in 2017.She called Stunt \u0027horrible and narcissistic\u0027, adding: \u0027The man is not a billionaire and never was. Naively, I funded his life for our entire marriage.\u0027She added that Bernie had loaned him £10 million for his \u0027failed gold business\u0027 and said that Stunt \u0027spent most most of his days in bed high on prescription drugs\u0027.She said that he had threatened to kill her and expressed the hope that her unborn baby died of Aids. She added: \u0027The sad reality of it is James is not a gangster . . . he\u0027s just a prat.\u0027Stunt later responded to her accusations, describing them as \u0027falsehoods\u0027. He added: \u0027Petra, it\u0027s very sad that you\u0027ve had to tell so many lies.\u0027One daughter at war with her ex the other heartbroken by theft.As Bernie is no doubt sick and tired of being reminded, money sure can\u0027t buy happiness."},{"url":null,"title":"John Bercow cashes Speaker fame signing dinner speech agency","story":"Share this article It came days after his general election night punditry on Sky News – for which he was reportedly paid £60,000 – when he again used the phrase.Mr Bercow has wasted no time in launching a media and public speaking career since he stepped down from the Speaker\u0027s Chair on October 31.

Two days later he will be back in London – at an event in aid of The Clement James Centre charity.At the end of January he is billed to appear as a speaker at the Advertising Association conference. Other speakers include Google, Facebook, Channel 4 and ITV executives.Before stepping down, Mr Bercow said in August that it would leave \u0027a bad taste\u0027 if he were seen to profit from his time as Speaker.Last night JLA would not comment on behalf of itself or Mr Bercow on how much he makes from speaking, or if it organised his appearance on Italian TV."},{"url":null,"title":"ANDREW PIERCE Tories latest cohort MPs provide portrait contemporary Britain","story":"Share this article Youngest Tory MP         Sara Britcliffe, 24Constituency: Hyndburn, majority of 2,951.Family: Her victory was sweet revenge for her father Peter, who twice tried and failed to win the constituency for the Tories.Education: Modern languages graduate from Manchester UniversityOccupation: Used to run a sandwich shop.Fun fact: The Tories\u0027 youngest MP, at the age of 22 she took a gap year from university to be the youngest Mayoress in the country – when she officiated by the side of her father, a councillor for more than 30 years, in Hyndburn.Trade union rep         Jonathan Gullis, 29Constituency: Stoke-on-Trent North, majority of 6,286.

Witnessing this mega city from the plane is to suddenly realise the immensity of modern China. Roughly 50 million people live in this urban sprawl surrounding Hong Kong.Lianzhou is a four-hour drive from Guangzhou into the forested mountains of Guangdong province. It is perhaps an unlikely destination for a major arts event. But in 2005, Duan Yuting, a 47-year-old former photo editor for a Guangzhou newspaper, chose the city to found the festival, now firmly established as China’s leading contemporary photography event.For its 15th edition, the work of 50 artists from China and around the world can be viewed in a museum and two former industrial spaces in Lianzhou.One of the first exhibitions on show at the Granary venue is Argentinian artist Seba Kurtis’s series Immigration Files. Kurtis grew up in Buenos Aires before, at 27, escaping the Argentinian financial crisis of 2001 for a new life in Europe, only to find more hardship as an illegal immigrant in Tenerife.One of the few things Kurtis brought to Europe was a shoebox of family photographs and Super 8 films, rescued from his grandmother’s home after a flood. Mixed in with the photographs were artworks that Kurtis’ younger sister had created with glitter and glue. The flood had damaged the images, causing the glitter to meld with the emulsion from the photographs. Kurtis set about digitising these precious, distorted images. “I realised I couldn’t see the faces of family members I might never see again,” he says. “The water damage became representative of violence in my later work.”Kurtis, who is now based in Manchester, UK, would spend seven years as an undocumented immigrant on the Canary Islands and mainland Spain. The uncertainty and anxiety of that time, and his memories of the life he left behind in Argentina pervade the images on show at Lianzhou. In them, he returns to the bucolic coastlines of Tenerife and the Canary Islands – the first sight of land countless refugees glimpse as they cling to hazardous rafts crossing the Mediterranean.Evoking his sister’s artworks, Kurtis decorates these photographic landscapes with glitter. But he does so meaningfully as a way to visually illustrate recent sociological surveys detailing suicides, evictions and crimes among refugee communities in the Canary Islands. Aesthetically, he is linking his own history to that of the migrant experience. “The glitter represents my story, my family’s story,” he says.The tolls of migration, the loss of family and the pull of home are felt by many millions of Chinese citizens. These are captured with vivid detail by Chinese artist Qian Haifeng in his portraiture series The Green Train, an exhibition eight years in the making, and also on show at the Granary.“Green trains” are China’s cheapest form of long-distance travel. For the price of one first-class ticket from Shanghai to neighbouring Nanjing, one can travel the entire length of China on a green train. They are typically used by the lowest-income migrants. On the national day of the People’s Republic of China in October, these relics of the Cultural Revolution become the vessels for millions of Chinese migrants to return to their ancestral homelands.In the decade before he became a known photographer, Qian Haifeng was a fellow passenger. He was fascinated by the people with whom he shared such journeys – and never met again. In Lianzhou, he describes the carriages of the green trains as “live stages, where everyone’s lives are on display for others to see, and where everyone present has the potential to play a leading role”.Duan Yuting, the festival’s director, awarded Qian with the Lianzhou Foto festival’s Punctum prize in 2015. “When I gave him the award, many professional Chinese photographers did not like it,” Duan says. “But his most important characteristic is that he’s not an artist. He is just the same as the people on the trains. He lived there with them, and that’s how he related to them. That’s why only he was able to take these photographs.”The forested wilderness surrounding Lianzhou is home to some of the world’s rarest and most elusive animals, including China’s dwindling population of tigers.With this in mind, Swiss photographer Alex Hanimann displays his series Trapped at the Granary. This a collection of photographic portraits of wild animals taken by camera traps at night.Hanimann originally intended the images to be used in a scientific survey. But he realised his camera was capturing these secretive animals at their most expressive and characterful.Hanimann considers these images to be self-portraits – and unconscious selfies. The animals were unaware of the cameras, yet Hanimann saw “a world of small, dramatic happenings, micro-dramas and gestures”.Chinese authorities were present at the festival’s opening and did not take kindly to the work of Jenny Rova. Much of Rova’s exhibition, Älskling, which translates as “sweetheart”, was removed by censors before the public had chance to see it. In doing so, the authorities robbed Lianzhou of the chance to witness a beautiful and intimate example of conceptual portraiture.In 2015, the Swedish photographer, who lives and works in Zürich and combines her artistic practice with her work as a waitress, contacted each of her former partners. She asked them to send her all the images they took of her during their relationship. She ended up with 55 photographs from nine former lovers, revealed to us as Anders, Amir, Jonas, Henning, Étianne, Boran, Johan, Bruno and Dan.Speaking at the festival, Rova describes Älskling as: “My attempt to capture the way we look at each other when we’re in love, from one lover to the next.”Älskling begins in the hills surrounding Uppsala, Sweden, where Rova spent her teenage years, and ends with her facing orce while bringing up her infant son.By making these shared moments public, Rova reveals how different relationships can reveal contrasting, hidden sides of our personalities. The images comment on the role former relationships can play in the present of our lives – “you can sense the identity behind the camera,” she says.Behind the ScarA photographer dealing with memory, sex and the self in a radically ergent way is the Chinese photojournalist Liang Yingfei, who works for Beijing’s Caixin Media. Perhaps more so than any other artform, documentary photography is highly controlled in China, so Liang and her fellow photojournalists must develop creative conceptual techniques to explore their subjects without alerting the authorities.In Lianzhou, Liang tells the stories of sexual abuse survivors. The series, she says, was instigated after a friend was abused by a charity worker on a voluntary trip.After obtaining the trust of survivors of abuse, Liang used her camera to “reconstruct and visualise the recurring traumatic nightmares victims have experienced in the aftermath”. Her images include a slug crawling along a woman’s skin as she sleeps and a doll being held underwater.Resplendent with purple hair, the Shanghai-based photographer Coca Dai has been in trouble with the authorities before. But they allowed the festival to exhibit his compulsive, chronological portraits of his partner, Judy, over the course of their eight years together. The exhibition moves from portraits taken on the day they met, when the couple were still teenagers, through to the birth of their first child and on to the present day. Judy often poses like a conventional model but Coca’s images of her show her asleep, eating, or bathing herself or their child.Much of China remains avowedly patriarchal so unvarnished experiences of Chinese femininity are often hidden from view. Lin Ye, the Chinese curator, says of Coca’s exhibition: “In history, women have always lived under ship of men. They have been disciplined and trained to accept male scrutiny and cater to male standards. This visual mechanism has allowed women to internalise men’s scrutiny on themselves.”Coca’s unflinchingly honest portrayal of Judy, created in the linage of artists such as Nan Goldin and Wolfgang Tillmans, is an inversion of this lineage. These images may be authored by a man but they are a powerful portrait of modern Chinese womanhood. And they point, defiantly, to a more tolerant and hopeful future.For his series Freezing Land, Shanghai-based photographer Chen Ronghui used Kuaishou, or “choir show”, a Chinese social video app comparable to TikTok, to explore the lives of young people living in Fularji. The area was a once prosperous district in the province of Heilongjiang, near the border with North Korea. “Kuaishou is despised by many people in China,” Chen says in Lianzhou. “This is a story of young people getting back the right to express themselves.”The temperature can often drop to -30C (-27.4F) in Fularji, but the economy has frozen, too. “We’re used to thinking of Chinese cities purely in the context of massive growth but Fularji is an exception,” Chen says. Fularji was once China’s most renowned steel town. In the 1960s, it became home to the headquarters of China First Heavy Industries, and more than 15 million immigrants came to the region during Mao’s era. Today, it’s facing a bigger economic recession than anywhere else in China.Chen used Kuaishou to explore the lives of millennials living in the once great town, making contact first with Lin Zi, a 14-year-old who uses a local cafe to stream live performances online. After dropping out of school, Lin has gained almost a million fans. “My parents abandoned me and I make money by doing drag shows on a live streaming app,” Lin told Chen.“The young people I met on Kuaishou all experience a sense of uncertainty,” Chen says. “They face a choice: to leave for challenges in bigger cities or stay behind and embrace their fate. This is a wider story about China the uncertainty about our future, no matter who we are.”• Lianzhou Foto festival 2019 takes place in Lianzhou, China, until 3 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e7b6f083a914bc006c643135827c0aa04cb1e99/24_1706_2695_1617/master/2695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=585cb654f980d86357d408c3ba7fb385","title":"top 15 photography books of 2019","story":"Pilgrims, hippies and voyeurs are among the subjects of this year’s most intriguing photo books, while the vivid dissonance of the Indian night conveys an essential truth about our times American photographer Gregory Halpern’s much anticipated follow-up to 2016’s acclaimed ZZYZX, which was a meditation on Los Angeles as a heightened state of mind as much as an actual place. With Omaha Sketchbook, Halpern explores the notion of American masculinity, his setting the midwestern Nebraskan city of the title where fundamentalist Christian values predominate. The book is designed to look like one of his work-in-progress notebooks, while his portraits and landscapes have a sense of suspended time as if the meaning of the place and its people remains somehow elusive despite the deep fascination he feels for them.Originally published on Bastille Day, 1968, by City Lights in San Francisco, On the Barricades is a sturdy zine-type publication that juxtaposes grainy images from the student uprising in Paris that year with the often elliptical situationist slogans that appeared daily on the city’s walls. It makes for an interesting, if surreal, blend of image and text, with lines such as “The smoke of grenades in the meadow of our eyelashes” accompanying photos of stone-throwing students facing off against cops firing teargas. This faithful facsimile from the ever-inventive Mörel books is an artefact from another, more revolutionary, time and a reminder of the impromptu creativity that attended the now distant youth protests of May 68.A complex photobook on every level, American Origami is an exploration of the psychological aftermath of seven American mass school shootings which combines Andres Gonzalez’s own detached, low-key photographs of now familiar towns and communities with a surfeit of statistical and forensic documents. Resembling a packed folder, the book unfolds to reveal a wealth of other related materials: news clippings, handwritten notes, drawings, memorabilia and an inventory of objects that speak of mass grieving. (More than 65,000 teddy bears were sent to Sandy Hook elementary school alone in the wake of the shooting there.) An ambitious attempt at understanding – and visualising – the fallout from a senselessly recurring American tragedy.A single retrospective volume that comprises Irish photographer Eamonn Doyle’s three self-published and now highly collectible photobooks, i, On and End. The first was described by Martin Parr as “the best street photobook in a decade”. Doyle’s often disorienting images of Dublin’s passing strangers are here paired with characteristically surreal prose by the Irish novelist Kevin Barry and the bold design is by the photographer’s longtime collaborator Niall Sweeney. The result adds up to a heady remix of Doyle’s small but vital back catalogue, its iconoclastic spirit more attuned to his parallel career as an electronic music producer and record label boss.A deceptively simple photobook that comprises just 14 portraits of Paul Graham’s elderly mother as she sits in an armchair in a retirement home. The muted colour tones and floral patterns of her clothes, bathed in natural light from a nearby window, seem almost universal in their evocation of old age and fragility. Graham’s point of view remains constant, his camera recording the slightest shifts in mood and expression. An intimate and meditative, but never intrusive, series of portraits that speak quietly of family ties, ageing and encroaching mortality.Peter Watkins was nine years old when his mother took her own life by walking into the sea. His long-term project, The Unforgetting, is part elegy, part meditation on the tides and long shadow of grief. Watkins creates sculptural still lifes from the things left behind, whether an unopened handbag or a cassette tape, each carrying its own secrets and imbued with a talismanic presence. Whether self-portraits or constructed tableaux, his starkly formal images reverberate with a sense of absence. A book about remnants, traces, memories and the unsettling power of photography.Alongside the recently published The Sound I Saw, which gathers Roy DeCarava’s beautifully meditative portraits of jazz performers including John Coltrane and Billie Holiday, Light Break offers a wider perspective on the life and work of a singular, somewhat elusive 20th-century American photographer. A master of often luminous street scenes and quiet, deeply observational portraits, DeCarava is perhaps most well known for Sweet Flypaper of Life, his collaboration with Langston Hughes. This illuminating retrospective shows the full range of his work and the consistency of his vision.The village of Älvdalen, in the west of Sweden, still has its own ancient language, Elfdalian. The place and its people cast a spell on Swedish-born photographer Maja Daniels, who spent her childhood summers there, roaming free in the woods. Her book is a meditation on memory, mystery and belonging that contrasts her own often impressionistic landscapes and portraits with the work of a pioneering local photographer and eccentric, Tenn Lars Persson, who was born there in 1878. It is this visual dialogue between old and new, strange and commonplace, that lends the book its quiet cumulative power.Prefaced by an Emily Dickinson poem – “Tell all the Truth but tell it slant” – Aaron Schuman’s book couples his own wryly revealing photographs (all taken within a 30-mile radius of the poet’s home town of Amherst, Massachusetts) with clippings from the police report section of the local newspaper. To give just one example: “A man shoveling snow on State Street told police he saw a strange orange glow coming from the eastern sky that might have been something on fire. Police determined the glow was probably the sun coming up for the day.” Slant is a witty, deadpan meditation on small-town America that carries a darker undertow in the age of fake news, post-truth politics and alternative facts.Some photobooks stand alone for their subject matter and the audacity of their approach. The Park is a case in point. In the early 1970s, Kohei Yoshiyuki captured the illicit sexual encounters that took place in Tokyo’s parks at night, creeping close to furtive couples and the voyeurs that observed them. His infrared camera lends these clandestine acts another layer of transgression, capturing the desperation and essential loneliness of these fleeting encounters as well as the creepiness of those watching. A compelling if unsettling book, reissued with additional previously unseen images.“The Second Shift is the term given to the hidden shift of housework and childcare primarily carried out by women on top of their paid employment,” writes Irish artist Clare Gallagher in her short introduction to a beautifully designed book of deftly observed images. They evoke the quotidian work rituals of home and family, and her own anger at what is taken for granted. For all that, Gallagher is a quiet photographer, a creator of intimately observed details that can often approach the dreamlike: unwashed laundry overflowing from a basket, a tangle of electrical wires emanating from an extension socket, vegetable peelings, eggshells, food residue soaking in an oven dish. Her images illuminate a domestic grind so familiar and habitual that it all but goes unseen.In 1968, Dennis Stock, best known for his iconic portraits of James Dean, took a five-week road trip through California to document the hippie counterculture of rock festivals, communes and drug-fuelled mind expansion. To the sceptical photographer, California had become a “head lab” for the adventurous and impressionable. The more he travelled, though, the more his fascination grew. His images of hippies, bikers, surfers, protesters and utopian dreamers remain resonant, becoming reflections of a freer, more questioning US bathed in the glow of collective optimism and that fabled California sun.Tomlinson has been acclaimed for her images of contemporary pilgrims in religious sites in France, Poland and Ireland. Ex-Voto gathers her stark monochrome portraits of pilgrims, large format landscapes and mysterious still lifes of offerings left in rocks and trees at Lourdes, Ballyvourney and Grabarka. The results possess a kind of serene calmness that befits the subject matter, her portraits in particular capturing the reverent otherness and simplicity of the devotional life.Close to where he lives in rural Sweden, English photographer Stephen Gill drove a tall wooden stake into the ground near a stream in a flat landscape of spreading fields. On an adjacent wooden pillar, he mounted a motion-sensor camera. From that simple idea, The Pillar was born: a book of photographs of wild birds in close-up, alighting and taking flight, resting, feeding, preening and watching. “I’d never seen birds in this way before,” writes Karl Ove Knausgård in his accompanying essay, “as if on their own terms, as independent creatures with independent lives … and so infinitely alien to us.”An evocation of “the loneliness and suspicion of the Indian night”, The Coast is a vivid, unsettling merging of the fictional and the real. Hura’s free-flowing visual narrative echoes both the overload of social media imagery and the edginess he encountered on unfamiliar Indian streets at night.Playing with ideas of privacy, voyeurism and trust, the young Indian photographer creates an almost hallucinatory world where spectral figures loom out of the enveloping dark, people grapple in the rubble and religious revellers give way to abandonment, their faces daubed with powdered paint.The context is what Hura describes as the “increasing dissonance” of India’s Hindu nationalist politics. The Coast possesses a visual dissonance of its own through his use of unforgiving flash, colour saturation and frequently jarring juxtapositions of the real and the staged. “For me,” says Hura, “the notion of photography as fiction is a given.” For all that, his unreal images convey an essential truth about our turbulent times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc8e64a418bc6730796b4c97e63ab1730f5dd9d8/0_14_3984_2391/master/3984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deb6e29c0ff2dff91bc0989e15d50a6f","title":"australian heatwave records forecast to be broken as temperatures surge past 40c","story":"Oodnadatta and Port Augusta forecast to reach 48C and Sydney’s western suburbs to hit 45CDecember heat records are expected to tumble in Australia from Wednesday as a heatwave moves across South Australia to Victoria and New South Wales.Temperatures are forecast to peak in Victoria and South Australia on Friday, with Oodnadatta and Port Augusta to reach 48C, and peak in NSW on Saturday.NSW has been placed under a total fire ban from midnight on Tuesday to midnight on Saturday as firefighters battle to contain more than 100 fires burning around the state, including the 400,000 hectare Gospers Mountain megafire in Wollemi national park in the Blue Mountains.Smoke from this fire is forecast to lay thick over Sydney on Wednesday morning, but will shoot up to 3km up into the atmosphere on Thursday when the heatwave reaches western Sydney. Penrith is forecast to reach 44C on Thursday and 45C on Saturday, while the eastern suburbs of Sydney will reach 39C on Thursday and 35C on Saturday.Extreme fire danger is forecast for greater Sydney, the Illawarra and the southern ranges on Thursday.Tibooburra, a small town in the far north-west of NSW, has been above 40C since Monday and is expected to remain above that temperature until Christmas Day.Some of the official weather stations in NSW, like the Bathurst agricultural station, have records dating back 108 years. The hottest ever December day on record at that station is 38.9C on 27 December 1938, during a historic heatwave that wrought the deadly Black Friday bushfires on 13 January 1939.The hottest temperature ever recorded at that station was 41.5C on 11 February 2017, a day of catastrophic fire danger on which the St Ivan fire burned 55,000 hectares of bush and farmland and destroyed 35 homes around Uarbry in the upper Hunter Valley.“The forecast predicts that Bathurst is going to exceed that December record by a pretty big margin, with a forecast top of 41C,” Taggart said. “To be having these levels of temperatures at this time of year, not in the peak of summer but in mid-December, is pretty big.”This year was tracking to be Australia’s second hottest on record, behind 2013, based on average monthly temperature data from January to November. It would have sailed into second place had December temperatures been average.“It is going to provide pretty tough competition for Australia’s warmest year on record,” Taggart said.Three of the four hottest years on record in Australia have occurred in the past six years, and all have occurred in the past 15.“Australia has warmed by about 1.4C since pre-industrial times and that warming trend is increasing,” Taggart said. “So as climate scientists have been saying for 20 years, we can expect more frequent heatwaves, and more severe heatwaves, and this is certainly an example of that.”The southern parts of SA, from Port Lincoln to Mount Gambier, will also be under a total fire ban tomorrow, with extreme fire danger in the Yorke Peninsula, areas outside Adelaide, and the lower south-east.A total fire ban will also be enforced in the Wimmera region of Victoria on Wednesday, where the danger rating has been set at severe. The rest of the state, including the Mallee region, which will see the top temperatures tomorrow with Mildura to reach 43C, has a fire danger rating of very high.Melbourne is forecast to reach 39C on Wednesday and 41C on Friday, when Mildura is forecast to experience its hottest ever December day of 47C.“It’s going to be hot all the way through,” said Christie Johnson, duty forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology in Victoria."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f50c5ed7ea999c75782f260939691b8217281d30/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55d53b9920c43bada0ba523f53c6d0c1","title":"all nighters and sideways ideas readers books of the year","story":"From rich histories to intense, dystopian futures, commenters share the highlights of their reading yearsI immensely enjoyed almost all books that I read from this year. By far, Deborah Levy’s The Man Who Saw Everything (Hamish Hamilton) was my favourite. Very close behind was Ann Patchett’s The Dutch House (Bloomsbury), which I picked after reading Cardellina’s enthusiastic comments. I’m so grateful for it because I absolutely loved it … a stunning novel.VesnaD13The second book in Philip Pullman’s Book of Dust trilogy, The Secret Commonwealth (PenguinDavid Fickling) picks up the story of Lyra, her daemon Pantalaimon, Malcolm and others 20 years after Lord Asriel left Lyra at Jordan College under “scholastic sanctuary”. Lyra’s adventures continue in the complex and detailed worlds Pullman has created. Beautifully written, the story brings you to tears. Eagerly anticipating the third book. IsisWalnutThis Life by Martin Hägglund (Profile) challenged my beliefs. The Swedish professor of literature outlines his philosophy of life using literary memoirs by Augustine, Proust and Knausgaard as sources. He claims that true freedom is about how we choose to spend our limited time while we are alive contrasting this with religious ideas of an eternal afterlife that undermine the value we place on this life … Given the climate emergency, and the failure of capitalism to respond quickly enough, the time seems ripe for a radical rethink of how we live. rgilyeadNo trouble making a choice this year: The Five by Hallie Rubenhold (Doubleday). It’s a remarkable, well researched and readable book about the lives of the five known victims of Jack the Ripper. It was more than time that those women were shown some respect as human beings. So much has been written about the murderer’s possible identity and the victims have been sidelined for too long. I recommend this book to anyone. Maggie BAs someone who grew up on dance music and club culture in the late 80searly 90s, my book of the year is Join the Future: Bleep Techno and The Birth of British Bass Music by Matt Anniss (Velocity Press). Really well written and comprehensively sets the sociopolitical backdrop in Yorkshire to the most exciting five years or so in the development of British dance music. ColinKmagPatience by Toby Litt (Galley Beggar) is a desperately beautiful, emotionally intense, and uniquely moving novel told by Elliott, a remarkable narrator who is a wheelchair user. Elliott’s greatest abilities and greatest lessons for us are to make so great an experience from so little, to examine even the most mundane and limiting circumstances for their variety, meaning and experience, to approach life with a wonderful mixture of optimism and hope while still being fully aware of its sadness and tragedy. MrBrownDrive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk (translated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones, Fitzcarraldo). Strange and unusual, it draws you in with its flat, brilliant sentences and brings up in a fresh, sideways fashion some crucial ideas: connection to the larger-than-human natural world the nature of authority economic venality how do we know anything? (For those who might have missed it, she’s the Polish writer who won the 2018 Nobel prize in literature, which I now think was an inspired choice.) cannotlookawaySince I tend to read either library books or secondhand ones, my reading list is a bit short on the latest bestsellers – my principle usually being if it deserves to be read it will still be good reading a year (or 20) later. But one book I did cough up for new this year was Plastic Emotions by Shiromi Pinto (Influx Press), about the relationship between Le Corbusier and Minnette da Silva, the first woman to become an architect in Sri Lanka and the first Asian woman in the Royal Institute of British Architects. Not everyone may share my enthusiasm for long discussions on modern architecture as voiced by the characters, or musings on feminism. But those interested will enjoy it. CloudyAgainI read The Fell by Robert Jenkins (RedDoor Press) twice. Once as an all-nighter and again slowly to really appreciate the beauty and simplicity of language as we follow the teenage narrator descend into dark and magical places. The bonding and rebelliousness of the urban tribe, the love and loss, the dislocation and abandonment but ultimately the triumph and sheer delight in chaos. It saved my life and it genuinely feels like something very special has been overlooked in this book not getting mass coverage. Ulysses meets Fight Club … a Catcher in the Rye for our times but so much more. JohnnyTbetterThe Giver of Stars by JoJo Moyes (Penguin) is about the horseback library women in Kentucky in the 1930s, who brought books to the desperately poor families in the backwoods and hills, in a scheme begun by Eleanor Roosevelt. It’s a lovely novel, full of beautiful description and memorable characters, and the overriding theme – the value of stories and literature – is one very close to my heart. elfwynAfter thoroughly enjoying Natalie Haynes’s The Children of Jocasta, I was not disappointed with her 2019 book A Thousand Ships (Mantle). I’m still enjoying Julie Armfield’s collection of short stories, Salt Slow (Picador). As for non-fiction, McKenzie Wark’s Capital Is Dead. Is This Something Worse? (Verso) is an excellent critique of lazy left thinking on the inevitability of capitalism, the “sacralisation” of Marxisant thinking and the need to think creatively about social life. She never disappoints. tony2014Middle England by Jonathan Coe (Viking), a fictionalised account of Britain from 2010-2018 as seen through the experiences of the Trotter family and friends the third book in the series. Insightful and humorous. Whimsy2015In the last couple of months, I’ve been very impressed by Yōko Ogawa’s The Memory Police (translated by Stephen Snyder, Harvill Secker), an extraordinary meditation on the nature of memory that is, at the same time, proof that dystopian fiction can be beautifully written.And with an eye on global climate change, Cynan Jones’s Stillicide (Granta) is a little similar in style to Reservoir 13, in that a whole community emerges through a series of more or less oblique, more or less self-contained chapters (in this case, originally written as 15-minute stories for broadcast on BBC Radio 4). I was alerted to it by a fine review in the  by Nina Allen, whose superb The Rift I had just finished reading, and whom I am fast coming to consider as a reviewer of comparable stature to John Burnside or M John Harrison. robjam10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World by Elif Shafak (Penguin) is a splendid book. It was so full of everything: history, geography, love and friendship, family. It was serious and comic … just a beautiful book. VignolesViewThe Wall by John Lanchester (Faber) is a fascinating and chilling story of Britain after “the Change”, which is the catastrophic consequences of global warming. All we really learn about that is that sea levels have risen. Britain is now surrounded by a wall built to keep the Others out. The narrator is a guard on the wall and the author brilliantly relates his story of long periods of boredom disrupted by the sudden violence of attacks by the Others. The story is, however, curiously ethnocentric and you are left wondering what happened to the rest of Europe and the world. Still, a thrilling and thought-provoking read. Buddha_indeedFighting the People’s War by Jonathan Fennell (CUP) draws on army censorship reports to paint a picture of the morale and motivation of British and Commonwealth armies in the second world war and shows that the citizen soldiers required more complex motivation to make them fight than “for King and Country”. It covers the efforts that the allied armies used to improve the morale of their soldiers and highlights the role of one of the forgotten heroes of the war, General Sir Ronald Adam, Adjutant-General of the British army, whose job it was. SackTheJugglerI read The Anarchy: The Relentless Rise of the East India Company by William Dalrymple (Bloomsbury) two months ago after reading this review in the . It did not disappoint. It is beautifully written. It has a superb cast of characters. It is driven by a strong narrative. It is related to our times with its focus on ruthless corporate greed and corrupt politics. The illustrations are gorgeous. theupsetappletartI’m nominating The Carer (Headline) by that writer’s writer Deborah Moggach. It’s a wryly humorous comedy of manners, though you might not expect it from an initial plot summary. James, retired from his position as an eminent academic and living in the family’s former holiday cottage, is not coping well after his wife dies. After he has a fall his children, who have the usual mid-life problems, decide he needs live-in care.Eventually they engage frumpy-but-cheerful Mandy, but then start to worry about her influence as the old man’s behaviour changes radically. And no, it’s not what you (and they) initially think. And yes, it should generate discussion about parents and children, relations between men and women, social expectations and obligations, keeping secrets and telling the truth.

More than 700 Max jets are now grounded worldwide. It is the first time in 20 years that Boeing has halted 737 production and the move could have significant repercussions for the US economy.Boeing is the US’s largest manufacturing exporter and a shutdown would impact suppliers across the country, hitting the country’s already troubled manufacturing sector. The suspension has already led to the cancellation of thousands of flights scheduled by airlines that were awaiting new planes or had bought ones that are now grounded.The Seattle Times reported on Sunday that the board was considering a proposal from top management to temporarily shut down 737 production in Renton, Washington from January. Boeing as yet has no timeframe for restarting production but plans to redeploy its 12,000-strong Renton workforce.Boeing has said if it did not receive approval to begin deliveries before the end of the year it could be forced to further slow production or temporarily shut down the Max production line, a move that would have repercussions across its global supply chain.On Thursday, Boeing abandoned its goal of winning approval this month to unground the 737 Max after its chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, met FAA administrator Steve Dickson. Dickson said on Wednesday he would not clear the plane to fly before 2020 and disclosed the agency had an ongoing investigation into 737 production issues in Renton, Washington.Dickson said there were nearly a dozen milestones that must be completed before the Max returns to service. Approval is not likely until at least February and could be delayed until March, US officials told Reuters last week.Boeing had said last month it expected the FAA would allow it to resume 737 Max deliveries in December.The FAA told congressional staff in an email last week Dickson was “concerned that Boeing continues to pursue a return-to-service schedule that is not realistic ... More concerning, the administrator wants to directly address the perception that some of Boeing’s public statements have been designed to force FAA into taking quicker action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bc49a067a841d26d707d1f89579272278392972/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78de5f4c7310ec8157eb2fe1ff08ba7c","title":"market value of top uk firms up 50bn as post election rally continues","story":"FTSE 100 posts biggest one-day gain since week after EU referendum in June 2016Britain’s leading companies have seen their stock market valuation rise by almost £50bn after the post-election rally in share prices gathered pace.In a second day of hefty gains, the FTSE 100 index shrugged off evidence that the economy was struggling in the run up to polling day and closed 165 points higher at 7,519.05.Shares in the City’s leading quoted prices have risen since the election despite the strengthening of sterling, which depresses the value of profits made by the large number of FTSE 100 companies that do business outside the UK.The stock market has been boosted by a combination of factors – the prospect of an end to Brexit uncertainty, the removal of the threat of re-nationalisation following Labour’s defeat, and hopes that the interim trade deal between the US and China signals a rolling back of protectionism.London’s strong performance was part of a global trend that saw all three of Wall Street’s major share price indices lifted to record highs amid optimism of stronger, faster growth. Chinese share prices hit a six-week high and oil prices also rallied.Adding to the upbeat mood were weekend remarks by US trade representative Robert Lighthizer, who said an interim trade deal was “totally done” and that it is expected to nearly double US exports to China over the next two years.Some investors cautioned against overconfidence. “It’s good news but we can’t celebrate yet,” said Mark Mobius, founding partner of Mobius Capital Partners and former executive chairman of the Templeton Emerging Markets Group. “This agreement is dependent on the degree to which the Chinese comply,” Mobius said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b8242e1431d995834904c6d3f4f85bf66616f7b/0_180_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72f84271645bf65263d9ad3be810d3a8","title":"uk singapore on thames brexit france","story":"There’s little pressure among UK banks for deregulation – instead, France could be a bigger threatThe idea that London might have a post-Brexit future as a kind of deregulated “Singapore-on-Thames” is one of the more curious notions to have emerged in the three and a half years since the UK’s citizens voted narrowly to leave the EU in the fateful June 2016 referendum. In fact, at least as far as the financial sector is concerned, the bigger threat to European regulatory harmony could come from France.The phrase “Singapore-on-Thames” is shorthand for Britain becoming a low-tax, lightly regulated economy that can out-compete the sclerotic, over-regulated eurozone from a strategic position only 20 miles or so offshore. The general idea was first mooted a couple of years ago by Philip Hammond, then Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer, as a means of encouraging the EU to strike a friendly Brexit deal with the UK.Those who know Singapore well will quickly recognise that the analogy is far from perfect. True, Singapore has low tax rates (unless you wish to import an expensive foreign car), and low levels of public spending – although the latter does not seem to be part of the plan for Singapore-on-Thames advocates.But the idea that Singapore is a deregulated paradise is not borne out by reality, as anyone who has tried to dispose of a piece of used chewing gum there will know. As Guy de Jonquières has noted, Singapore’s success owes more to the fact that it is a “meticulously planned economy” with “handholding and cosseting” of overseas investors by “powerful, eager to please bureaucrats”.The political prospectuses of both major parties in the UK general election, with their nostalgic ideas for reviving British manufacturing, would seem to suggest that Britain should be reborn as a latter-day Stoke-on-Trent, rather than as a 21st century European Singapore. Nonetheless, the notion that the UK might seek a post-Brexit competitive advantage through deregulation – particularly in relation to financial services – has taken hold on the continent, where it has become something of a bogeyman, used to frighten other EU member states.The EU commissioner responsible for the financial sector, Valdis Dombrovskis, has warned that the UK cannot hope to retain access to EU markets if it departs from the bloc’s rules. “The more systemically important the market,” he argues, “the closer the regulatory alignment that is expected.” The UK, Dombrovskis says, must think very carefully before it moves away from rules followed by the rest of the EU. If it does erge, the access of UK-based financial firms to EU markets could be restricted.From the perspective of a London-based bank, this argument seems strange. I can identify no notable constituency in British politics that favours significant bank deregulation. The Bank of England argues that capital ratios are now adequate, and those who disagree tend to want even heavier burdens on banks. The issue of financial regulation has not featured prominently in the general election debates, which is hardly a surprise. And we have seen no sign that the pendulum is swinging back toward deregulation, as it has begun to do in the US.Whereas British politicians recently have offered no words of comfort to UK banks, France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has declared himself in favour of easing the capital burden on French banks in the interests of competitiveness. “We have gone too far in setting these requirements,” Le Maire said recently. Basel III, the stone tablets that contain the global standards for banking regulation, “must be simplified and lightened,” he declared, adding that “American banks are not subject to rules as strict as those which apply to European banks.”Le Maire thus seems to be on a collision course with Dombrovskis, the EU’s financial rule-setter-in-chief, who says, “the EU is committed to carrying through the final Basel III reforms faithfully.”That is the UK position, too, but it seems no longer to be the French view. So, in the world of financial regulation, a “Frexit” from the Basel framework seems more of a threat to the level European playing field than Brexit is. With the French president, Emmanuel Macron, having recently deemed Nato to be “brain dead”, it seems that a similar verdict on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is now being prepared.It is true that some aspects of the global agreement on Basel III, reached – reluctantly in the case of France and Germany – at the end of 2017, weigh more heavily on European banks than on their US peers. That is partly because mortgages are rarely securitised and sold in Europe, whereas in the US, two state-guaranteed enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, stand behind the mortgage market and warehouse loans originated by banks. Also, European banks lend more to large, highly-rated corporate customers, which in the US typically fund themselves in the capital markets. The so-called “output floors” in the Basel accord therefore affect European banks more severely.These are valid points. But, rather than launching another transatlantic political dispute, it would be preferable if consenting regulators could privately negotiate a way to smooth the hard edges in the Basel accord. Frexit could be just as damaging to Europe’s financial system as Brexit.• Sir Howard Davies, the first chairman of the UK’s Financial Services Authority, is chairman of RBS.

Remember, the pound hit $1.35 as the election results rolled in during the early hours of Friday morning.Michael Gove, who has been closely involved with no-deal Brexit planning, has defended the plan to make it illegal to request an extension to EU alignment beyond 2020.He told BBC Breakfast that the government is fully committed to delivering Brexit on time.We are going to leave the European Union on 31 January because of the withdrawal agreement. And then the political declaration, which goes alongside the withdrawal agreement, commits both sides to making sure that the follow-up conversations are concluded by the end of 2020.”And he denied that the December 2020 deadline could slip:“No. We are going to make sure we get this deal done in time.”There’s a real gender split in today’s unemployment report.The number of employed men jumped by 54,000 on the quarter to 17.31m, while the number of employed women fell by 30,000 to 15.49m. That reverses a recent trend, which has seen more women entering the labour market (partly due to pension changes).If you include bonuses, UK pay growth also took a hit last month.That’s partly because some workers received bigger bonuses in October 2018 than this year.Newsflash: Britain’s unemployment rate has stuck at its lowest level in 45 years, but wage growth has slowed.For August to October 2019, an estimated 1.28 million people were unemployed. This is 93,000 fewer than a year earlier and 673,000 fewer than five years earlier.Kit Juckes, foreign exchange analyst at Société Générale, says Johnson’s tough line on the post-Brexit trade talks has caught the markets by surprise.The news that UK PM Johnson plans to rule out (legally) any extension to the transition period after the UK leaves the EU has given sterling a kicking this morning.Those who thought that a big majority would free the PM to take a patient approach to negotiate the best possible deal, have been caught by surprise. And that’s most UK economists and strategists. Ho hum.Britain’s FTSE 250 index of medium-sized listed companies is also suffering a bout of Brexit blues.Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says:In essence all of the big gainers of the past few days are giving back some of their gains as the reality check of the possibility of a no deal Brexit, while still over a year away, has tempered some of the enthusiasm from last Thursday’s election result.The FTSE 100, though, is flat this morning as multinational companies are getting a boost from the weak pound (it makes their overseas earnings more valuable).Some City investors had thought that Boris Johnson would ‘pivot’ to the centre ground now he has a solid majority in parliament.The plan for a new cliff-edge Brexit deadline in a year’s time has dashed those hopes.Neil Wilson of Markets writes:Sterling tripped over its heels as Boris Johnson is looking to legislate for Britain to leave the EU fully in Dec 2020 with or without a trade deal. That means no possible way to extend the transition period. I must confess to believing he wouldn’t need to be so drastic, that a large majority offered the flexibility yet strength a government craves in deal making.This sets up another cliff-edge and could create yet more months of uncertainty for investors just when we thought all was squared away.Faisal Islam of the BBC says there’s a growing chance that Britain will be trading on WTO terms with the EU in just over year: Brexit isn’t the only thing hurting the stock market today.Boeing’s decision overnight to suspend production of its troubled 737 MAX jet is a blow to hundreds of suppliers.The pound is also suffering further losses against the euro, now down over one eurocent at €1.183 as traders anticipate a cliff-edge Brexit crisis next year.That’s a hefty fall, which sends sterling back towards last week’s levels before the election result. The realities of a majority Boris Johnson government have begun to dawn on the pound, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx.The newly minted Prime Minister and his team are working on amending the withdrawal agreement to make sure that the so-called transition period must end on December 31st 2020, seeking to ‘legally prohibit government agreeing to any extension’.With the threat of a no-deal Brexit re-emerging the other side of the election sterling’s extremely festive December was, if not cut short, then certainly a bit scrooged following these reports.

The pound has now lost much of its post-election surge, having briefly spiked over $1.35 in the early hours of Friday morning.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.After two days of strong gains, the City is subdued this morning as investors ponder how the next phase of Brexit will play out.The pound is coming under pressure, dropping by over half a cent against the US dollar back to $1.326. It’s also sliding back against the euro to below €1.19, just a couple of days after hitting three-year highs.Relief that Britain should exit in an orderly manner from the EU in a month’s time has been replaced by a new fear -- a rock-hard Brexit from December 2020 when the transition period ends.Overnight, it’s emerged that the government plans to tie its own hands with an amendment ruling out extending that transition beyond the end of 2020. Minister insist that they will have agreed the future relationship with Europe by then many experts are less confident, suggesting it could take years.Boris Johnson’s cunning plan is to force the EU to offer a good deal, but it’s likely to create a lot more uncertainty next year -- which is bad for sterling.Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada explains:he plan, first reported by ITV overnight is that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill “will legally prohibit the government agreeing to any extension” according to a senior government official. The idea is that it will force the EU to offer a better deal with the prospect of WTO-exit looking at the end of next year. In practice it would erode all the positives of a large Tory majority and bring us back to previous position of GBP uncertainty rising rather than falling next year. If passed, it would mean further GBP downside.Shares are also expected to dip this morning in London, following a two-day ‘Boris Bounce’ .Global factors also pushed shares up around the globe, boosting the FTSE 100 index by over £40bn on Monday, as my colleague Larry Elliott explains:The stock market has been boosted by a combination of factors – the prospect of an end to Brexit uncertainty, the removal of the threat of re-nationalisation following Labour’s defeat, and hopes that the interim trade deal between the US and China signals a rolling back of protectionism.London’s strong performance was part of a global trend that saw all three of Wall Street’s major share price indices lifted to record highs amid optimism of stronger, faster growth.

It should now merge with Labour and become a moderate influenceNo, it was not just Jeremy Corbyn. Last week’s crushing defeat of the left was also caused by the Liberal Democrat party splitting the vote. Yet again, by offering itself as the vote launderer of British liberalism, it has served as merely the fellow traveller of British Conservatism. Boris Johnson owes it a huge debt of gratitude.As for the election being a “second referendum” on Brexit, anti-Brexit or second referendum parties won more votes than did Johnson, even assuming all Tories were pro-Brexit. Yes, leave voters appear to have swarmed to the Conservatives, notably in the north, and are thus probably short-term. But the Lib Dem vote soared by 1.3m or 4.1 percentage points, while Corbyn’s fell by 2.6m. Johnson’s rose by only 304,000. The reality is that the left-of-centre vote was calamitously split. Polling during the campaign saw Labour surge only when the Lib Dems appeared to collapse.With the exception of the Tony Blair era, Labour has been persistently vulnerable to moderate leftwing sentiment defecting to the Liberals. Somehow such voters feel they can exonerate themselves from guilt by association with socialism without overtly siding with conservatives. They can comfort themselves that they voted “a curse on both houses”. In reality they did not. They effectively voted Conservative, or in a very few Lib Dem seats, they voted “hung parliament”.With the Lib Dems leaderless and in disarray, it must be time for them to do the honest thing and disband. They should reverse the old 1983 SDP marriage, and merge with a revivalist Labour. It would galvanise Labour’s moderate wing and dilute the influence of the Corbynites.The Liberals have never looked like winning an election since Lloyd George’s day. They have offered an electoral dustbin between political polarities, a media-cosseted Westminster club with a peerage auction for richer donors on the side. Liberals failed to capitalise on regionalism or nationalism. They were never truly radical, and in coalition were a broken reed. For the past year, the party has been a convalescent home for wounded warriors from the major parties, a gesture voters have treated with derision.This party is an anachronistic political spoiler. Its time is surely over. Liberal Democrats should disperse and confer their moderating influence on two bigger parties, who badly need it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70dc7311c7d0cb33fdbf9b6ec0a51b3cffdc09a1/0_50_5512_3307/master/5512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e08c2d0375cd43b58e5cbed17527aca0","title":"task labour members face listen candidates","story":"It’s vital the party gives an honest hearing to all the candidates before choosing the new leaderAs the Labour party gears up for another leadership election, the field comes into focus: Jess Phillips, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey are certain to run. Richard Burgon has both said he will and he won’t Keir Starmer hasn’t and will. Emily Thornberry was always hotly tipped, though may have been torpedoed when Caroline Flint allegedly accused her of calling “red wall” voters stupid. Yvette Cooper is still in the mix, as are Angela Rayner, Clive Lewis and David Lammy. They criss-cross all the obvious faultlines – Blairite versus Corbynite, authentic Labour versus metropolitan elite, Len McCluskey stooge versus independent mind and, of course, leaver versus remainer. Beyond those caricatures, however, are some genuinely interesting questions about the party’s future.Phillips is the right’s candidate. This may seem unfair, as on some issues, such as migration, she has taken a far more progressive position than would be considered typical of the right of the party. Indeed, she has surpassed much of the left on this. But her positioning is centre-right. She has charisma if any centrist candidate could muster their own entryists (centryists, we’re calling them), it would be her. Indeed, that’s her only obvious path to victory – a mass join-up of Jess Phillips superfans – since it’s hard to imagine existing Labour members swinging to such a different candidate.Lisa Nandy was deeply opposed to a second referendum, wedded to the line that the first one was the ultimate act of democracy, and had to be protected from those trying to stop it. However, unlike almost anyone else of that view, she is personally popular with remainers as well as leavers. Calling her the Blue Labour candidate would be an oversimplification, but there’s certainly an element of that ideology to her worldview, which appears to be that the white working class of the left-behind north are fundamentally different to their peers in the cities, and only when the Labour party understands and prioritises them will it rediscover its soul. Her problem will be what happens when she’s head-to-head with Rebecca Long-Bailey, if Unite still backs the latter.But will it? Long-Bailey is currently the favourite, the choice of both McCluskey and John McDonnell. Until six months ago it was taken as read that the members would naturally fall in with whomever the inner circle anointed. So, it seemed, there would be a coin-toss between Long-Bailey and Angela Rayner, who were both put at the centre of the election campaign. But what a poisoned chalice that was: they are both now tainted with having to make the case for Labour’s weak Brexit position, neither fully leave nor fully remain, and both undermined by that squirrelly equivocation that is the hallmark of the loyalist (the same holds for Burgon).The bitter rows over what was wrong with Labour’s Brexit position are easily resolved by the data: it lost nearly twice as many votes to pro-remain parties as it did to the Conservatives and Brexit party combined. But even had the deserters been mainly leavers, that would have been no vindication for those who were sent out with a neither-fish-nor-fowl offer that nobody wanted to eat. That doesn’t mean that Long-Bailey and Rayner are without promise, but they could both use some clear blue water between themselves and Corbyn if they’re to be judged on their own merits. There are rumours that Rayner is considering going for deputy instead, perhaps mindful of this. Nobody will have Corbyn’s 2015 boon of being the only leftwing candidate on the ballot.It is very difficult to see how Yvette Cooper could present herself as anything other than a return to the pre-Corbyn era – as disappointed as they are, there’s no sign party members are wishing for that. Thornberry has better differentiation from the old days, but was more compromised by her time in the shadow cabinet, especially in the runup to the election, when the party Rees-Mogged her.Keir Starmer has been the face of remain, but given the views of the members, that isn’t the problem that Lexiters think it is: rather, he faces the irrefutable charge of not being female. Some of this is plainly disingenuous. The Corbyn circle had no problem at all employing a lot of white men, plus their children andor ex-girlfriends, yet is happy to point the finger at other factions. While “it has to be a woman” isn’t a universal view across the party, there’s certainly a sense that you need a very good reason not to be one. Starmer’s other task will be to persuade members that he’s not a technocratic, centrist, north London lawyer rather, he’s a political radical who has seen the merit in the Corbyn project and wants to extend it beyond the man. Clive Lewis is seen as leftier, and has great green credentials, but he’s quite a maverick and may yet decide that there are other positions in which he could be more radical and adventurous.David Lammy is popular in his own right, and an increasingly impressive orator, with years of parliamentary experience. Plus, there’s this blindspot about race in the debate: Labour’s ethnic-minority vote was rock solid, but there have already been calls for the party to focus its efforts on the “white working class”. A good way to corrode the soul of a party – perhaps the best way – is to bank the people who actually support you and chase everyone else. Lammy doesn’t bank these voters. And now we have a card-carrying bigot in Downing Street, a strong anti-racist opposition leader will be vital. Even if he doesn’t stand, who he endorses will matter.There’s an important question about whom the Conservatives will fear most, and whom they’d be right to fear, but far more vital is that Labour members – and spectators, for that matter – actually listen to the candidates before they commit. Part of the left’s singular problem with ision is the tendency to try to talk to one another through carrier issues – if not Brexit then migration, or to which circle of hell Tony Blair and Chris Williamson belong – and identify who we’re talking to, whether they’re of our tribe, without actually hearing them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2b745bfa112ede4b391133e10be62a57c3b3c4a/0_297_3454_2073/master/3454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c41dc4c5632c496861e289f26f264d96","title":"first past post common ground","story":"One large swath of voters will not be well-represented in the new parliament. They can be variously described as centrist or centre-left, social democratic, liberal, moderate – choose your own label. It is a large group of people: not just the 3.7 million who voted for the Liberal Democrats, but millions of Labour voters who were more comfortable with Labour in the Tony Blair-Gordon Brown era, and who don’t necessarily describe themselves as “socialist”.In addition, there are some who normally vote Conservative but applauded the recent interventions of Michael Heseltine and John Major some who vote Green and millions of others who don’t have an “ism”. They see politicians as plumbers rather than priests, who “get things done” quietly and competently and without too much unpleasantness. None of these people wanted a parliament packed with nationalists of the English or Scottish variety, or with people advocating what they call “radical socialism”.I have been politically active in this centre space for most of the last half-century, only to see it increasingly marginalised. Part of the problem relates to our voting system – which, if it were reformed to something like the German, Irish or for that matter Scottish models, would give scope for meaningful representation and cross-party working. But this isn’t going to happen soon: the turkeys aren’t going to vote for Christmas having just been given free range.The fervent Brexiteers who won this election and the radical socialists who still control the Labour party believe the “liberal establishment” has had it too good for too long, with weaselly compromises muddy, soulless, consensus politics the middle way to nowhere. This elite “sold out the country” to foreigners in Brussels, to exploitative multinationals or to some other malign force standing between the government and the people.In the last parliament, a significant group of Labour and Conservative MPs felt the only escape from the tightening grip of militants in their party was to leave. They had the courage to put their careers on the line, to risk ostracism and put up with abuse. Some stood this time as Lib Dems, others as independents. They were wiped out. All of them. I suspect that those who stayed in the old parties have learned the value of obedience and cowardice.So what is to be done? There is a lot of wishful thinking. Business groups seem convinced that Boris Johnson will now pivot to a soft Brexit, and are already cooing over a few emollient words from the prime minister. But even if he is sincere (breaking the habit of a lifetime), do they seriously believe that his cabinet of Dominic Raab, Priti Patel, Jacob Rees-Mogg and others will conveniently vaporise? Similarly, on the left, there are vague hopes being expressed that if Jeremy Corbyn is replaced by a fresh face (preferably female), it will produce some form of political alchemy, turning unelectable dross into gold. We still hear the plaintive cry that “popular” policies – such as offering lots of things free of charge – are the route to power.There may also be a resurfacing of the idea that what the country needs is new parties. Usually the dream relies on imagining that Britain is somewhere else, and that we can wish away the first-past-the-post system, which has acted as a roadblock to the Lib Dems and the Greens. This folly should not be repeated. If we are to progress beyond semi-permanent Conservative rule, led by xenophobic populists, we have to change the old parties.The uncomfortable truth is that Labour, Lib Dems and Greens tend to do well – or poorly – in national elections at the same time, riding or being swept away by the same tides. In this election, numerous potential Lib Dem voters were repelled by what they saw as the risk of Corbyn. This phenomenon boosted the Tory vote, hampering Lib Dem efforts to recapture lost territory in the south-west and the prosperous towns and suburbs Labour struggles to reach.To adapt to the new reality, my party will have to move on from excessive zealous Europeanism – a cause that led to the unsuccessful revoke policy and has sadly now gone. The Lib Dems must be a voice for “leave” Carshalton – where we lost our excellent, longstanding MP Tom Brake – as much as for “remain” Twickenham. For its part, Labour will have to go back to Gordon Brown’s more disciplined approach to spending – and even to Tony Crosland’s Future of Socialism, written in the 1950s – to remind itself why its clause IV pledge was not a great idea.Labour and the Lib Dems are distinct political traditions with a complementary capacity to beat the Conservatives. This point is misunderstood by those who say each party betrays the other by existing at all. The answer is not a wholesale takeover of one by the other, but more accommodation between the two. If each of the parties will move a little, there is much common ground to find: around constitutional reform, the environment, civil liberties and social justice. As Johnson seeks a trade deal with the EU, there should be a joint defence not just of workers’ rights but of competition policy, where we should continue to look to Europe to restrain the power of companies such as Amazon and Google.I would hope that the spirit of cross-party groups such as Unite for Remain, More United and Compass can be mobilised around a shared programme beyond Brexit, to give hope to the politically homeless millions in the gaping middle.• Vince Cable was leader of the Liberal Democrats from 2017 to 2019 and is a former secretary of state for business"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/548fdc884b1eeae597f2711671aaafffa27db048/0_538_5248_3149/master/5248.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43c9e90a83f57cd4e1a83ad1a894901f","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of hope","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘hope’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘hope’.Share your photos of what hope means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 25 December at 10am.

A number of vice-chancellors subsequently sought legal advice, promising to oppose “state control” over university admissions.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is infuriating that universities have apparently responded to calls to end the use of certain types of unconditional offers by making more of them.“There are circumstances in which unconditional offers are appropriate, but not when the offer is made on condition that the student makes the university their firm choice. This practice has more to do with the frenetic scramble to put ‘bums on seats’ than the best interests of students.”Following the lifting of the cap on student numbers, there has been fierce competition between institutions who are dependent for their survival on undergraduate tuition fees and are recruiting from a shrinking pool of 18-year-olds.Other details revealed by the latest Ucas figures include:Universities UK (UUK), which advocates for 136 higher education institutions, is currently conducting a review of admissions practices. UUK chief executive, Alistair Jarvis, said: “An important principle of the UK system is that universities decide independently which students they accept but with this comes a responsibility to ensure that the admissions system continues to work in the best interests of students.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We expect universities to look seriously at these figures which show the impact unconditional offers have on students’ grades, and make sure their admissions practices are working for students.”Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the higher education regulator the Office for Students, said unconditional offers have a place in university admissions. “But we remain concerned by the continuing rise in so-called conditional unconditional offers, which risk pressuring students into making decisions that may not be in their best interests,” she said.

Kew scientists officially named 102 plants and eight fungi in 2019, but many are already in danger of extinction. The major threats are the destruction of natural habitat for farmland, timber, dams and mining, as well as the impacts of the climate crisis.“We all depend on plants,” said Martin Cheek, a senior botanist at Kew and who names about 10 new species a year. “It is shocking that we are still discovering so many. It is easy to think we know everything on this planet, but we don’t. The local people might know the plants, but they are unknown to science.”“It is important to name the plants now because natural habitat is disappearing rapidly,” he said. “Only when they have a name can they have an official assessment under the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and only then do we have a chance of getting national authorities to protect those areas.”The new snowdrop species was discovered in north-west Turkey when a paediatrician uploaded her holiday photos to Facebook, where they were spotted by a Ukrainian snowdrop specialist. The pair returned to the site and collected a sample, which was confirmed as a new species by Kew’s snowdrop expert Aaron Davis. The snowdrop has already been assessed as critically endangered.The new miracle berry species was discovered the rainforests of the Chimanimani Mountains, on the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border. The fruits of these species contain a compound called miraculin that blocks tastebuds so that sour foods, such as limes, taste sweet. The new species is classed as endangered, due to the continuing destruction of the forest.The rubbery shrub species was found on a single waterfall on the Bafing River in Guinea, west Africa. “They have some kind of biological superglue with which they can stick themselves to rocks to avoid being swept away, but this interesting compound hasn’t been investigated yet,” said Cheek.Kew scientists expect the shrub to become globally extinct when construction of a hydroelectric dam begins next year. “We have examples of species from that family that have been wiped out by other hydroelectric dams,” Cheek said. Plant extinctions in general are occurring at a “frightening” rate, according to scientists, and one in five of all plants are at risk.The rarest find in 2019 was the zonozono, a 20m-tall tree from the ylang-ylang family discovered in the Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. Just seven trees are known. The spectacular new violet family species was found in New Guinea.The bamboo fungus from Yunnan in south-west China was only given a formal scientific name in 2019, but has been used in the region as a traditional treatment for arthritis for more than 400 years. Scientific interest is increasing due to the discovery of compounds called hypercrellins in the fungus. When exposed to light, these compounds combat tumours, viruses and other fungi.Most new species are named after local places, but one Kew scientist took a more romantic approach. A new orange gladiolus found on top of a remote table mountain in Guinea is now called Gladiolus mariae, after Xander van der Burgt christened the plant after his wife Maria.“It is perfectly OK if other people name a species after you,” said Cheek. “But it would be considered very bad form to name a species after yourself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9b2179b5b58f89fc72691b31c4a15cb4bbc3600/0_13_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd0a489498316ab2c21440c64680ac9e","title":"best films 2019 uk no 4 little women","story":"Greta Gerwig’s freewheeling adaptation is the definition of a festive spirit-raiser, sending the sisters on a giddy and moving march to womanhood I hadn’t really been looking forward to Little Women. I didn’t love the book, nor the other four film versions, nor the innumerable times it’s been adapted for telly. Even more sacrilegiously, I didn’t much like Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig’s previous Saoirse RonanTimothée Chalamet love-in. My Chalamet allergy, kept in abeyance at that stage by his scant airtime, has considerably worsened in the two years since.Plus, I’m a bit iffy on films that appear to co-opt a post-MeToo manifesto for a period tale. Hence my reticence. And, perhaps, my evangelistic zeal after the screening.Because Little Women is an absolute gem. An instant five-star classic you’d be delighted to rewatch, in any company (elderly relative, small tot, total hipster – all would enjoy). It’s the definition of a festive spirit-raiser: funny and vivacious and moving, and so smart you’re happy to submit to outrageous button-pushing.This is a film which is busy in the best way. Scenes fall over themselves with chatter generally, of course, from the March sisters – Jo (Ronan), Meg (Emma Watson), Beth (Eliza Scanlen) and Amy (Florence Pugh). All the actors are terrific, with Ronan and Pugh standouts. Laura Dern is a balm as Marmie and Meryl Streep muzzles just enough of her camp as Aunt March. Chalamet is an ebullient, nervy Laurie, with Chris Cooper swaddled in beard and tough love as his grandfather and James Norton kindly as his Meg-smitten tutor. There’s a cute cameo, too, for Tracy Letts (who plays the dad in Lady Bird) as Jo’s crass publisher.Gerwig’s big innovation, other than some post-feminist self-authorship revisionism – which doesn’t feel nearly so grisly as that description suggests – is to shuffle the timeline. We start with Jo trying to flog stories in New York, then flit back and forth between present day and various stages of flashback.Given that most people will be going in knowing the two big twists (who dies, who turns down who), it’s only sensible. It also freshens the whole thing up. You’re never quite sure of what happens next, and Gerwig proves an innovative editor – there are great trims and terrific jumps, too. This is a film forever in an ecstatic rush.As for Chalamet? Luckily, Gerwig gives full rein to the horror of latter-day Laurie, burning through his cash and getting bratty and unattractive, which means his casting worked, for me at least, an absolute treat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c99533b06b1268769d3a10f8b47feed722c8530/442_1927_5021_3011/master/5021.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3aaea3135f31f670503a0080e88c863f","title":"nigel slaters fuss free christmas recipes smoked salmon pate vegetarian stuffing chickpea","story":"Smoked salmon, vegetarian stuffing and a versatile butter – festive dishes to take the pressure off this ChristmasThere is much to do in the kitchen. The traditional recipes are cast in stone, but those I value most at this time of year are often the simple, versatile, unerringly useful ones that will work for numerous occasions. A loose-textured pâté to press on small rounds of crispbread and pass round with drinks, or a stuffing that is suitable not just for the Christmas bird but for large and tender cabbage leaves and aubergines too.The pâté I suggest is straightforward and can be ready in minutes. Fat flakes of hot smoked salmon with crisp cucumber and basil leaves that can be served as a first course, perhaps with slices of treacley rye bread, or as a salad with bitter chicory or frisée. It will also serve as a filling for tartlets or tortilla.The stuffing here is a silky smooth chickpea mash with a crunchy, seedy texture from the addition of amaranth and dried figs. It can be baked in a loaf tin and spooned or sliced at the table. Softly spiced, it is suited to goose, turkey or pork, but also makes a good accompaniment to baked field mushrooms or roast root vegetables.I also offer a jolly useful butter. Deeply savoury, with crisply caramelised onions and notes of juniper, it has a smoky quality that lends itself to being used with salmon or trout, tucked into a baked potato or as something to spread on hot-from-the-toaster crumpets on Boxing Day afternoon.You can make this stuffing a day or more in advance. It will freeze, too. Cook it in a 20 x 12cm parchment-lined loaf tin, then let it rest for a good 20 minutes before spooning or slicing. Enough for 8Peel and finely chop the onions. Warm 3 tbsp of the olive oil in a deep pan, add the onions and let them cook over a moderate heat for 15-20 minutes until they are soft and pale gold. Take care not to brown them. Peel, finely chop and stir in the garlic, then add the cumin, coriander, chilli and a little black pepper.Bring a medium pan containing 400ml of water to the boil, then rain in the amaranth and let it simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes. Drain using a fine sieve. Put the pan back on the heat, add the chickpeas and their canning liquor and warm thoroughly. Chop the figs and apricots. Pull the leaves from the parsley. Remove the chickpeas from the heat then purée with the parsley leaves and remaining olive oil using a food processor. Set the oven 200Cgas mark 6.Combine the chickpea and parsley purée with the drained amaranth, dried fruits, onions and garlic. Transfer to the loaf tin, smoothing the surface and taking care to push the stuffing into the corners. Bake for 25-30 minutes.I suggest keeping the flakes of salmon as large and intact as you can, pressing them only lightly into the dish. That way the pâté stays open textured and, I think, more pleasing to the eye. Pile the salmon on to dark rye bread or rough textured crispbreads. Serves 6Cut the cucumber into thin slices and then into thin matchsticks, discarding the wet, seedy core as you go. Put the cucumber into a mixing bowl.Chop the dill fronds and add to the cucumber with a twist or two of black pepper. Tear the basil leaves into the bowl, then stir in the cream cheese, taking care not to over-mix.Break the fish into large flakes, pulling away the skin. Add to the cream cheese and cucumber then spoon into a terrine dish and press down lightly, just enough to make all the ingredients stick to one another. Serve the terrine with crispbread or dark and liquorice scented rye bread. and Observer aim to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

They soon found that singing had a “previously unseen” effect on the women, and decided to set up a dedicated group.Dickson says she can often see the effects of trauma in the physicality of new members.In a case study about one new recruit, Dickson wrote that when the woman was not singing, she would “sit on her chair holding her arms around herself, self-soothing by rocking back and forth”.Using her voice effected a dramatic change, though, reported Dickson. “The moment she engaged in vocalising musically, she became a different person.”The choir starts by playing group games, before moving on to rehearsals and eventually – for those who wish – performances. The “alumni choir”, made up of women who wanted to stay on after an initial year following their referral to Amies, has gone on to perform for the Desmond Tutu Foundation, Sadiq Khan at City Hall and, most recently, the packed Christmas service at St James’s in Piccadilly organised by Amos Trust – a highlight, says Dickson.“It’s changed me,’’ says Racheal Olawaniotogun, a soprano in the choir. “From my past experience to where I am today, words cannot describe it.”“My self-esteem – which was so low – gradually increased, and I was able to interact and ask questions of people. I wasn’t able to do that before.”Originally from Nigeria, Olawaniotogun has been singing with the choir for the past three years.“When I sing, I feel joyous. The inside of me feels very light – everything outside, whatever I’m going through, it disappears.”Olawaniotogun, who is now studying for a degree in accounting, says singing has provided her with coping mechanisms she can use to protect her mental health.She feels uncomfortable in large groups of people, but has gradually come to terms with performing in front of crowds.“Being in situations like that really helped me,” she says. “Let’s start with being in class at university. You’re in a massive room. In choir we focus on each other, we’re in the moment … so whenever I’m in such a crowd, I just close my eyes and try to focus on one thing.”Dickson agrees that the confidence the women show on stage can impact other areas of their lives. “It means that when they are speaking to lawyers and solicitors, they can stand up in front of them and look them in the eye and tell them what’s happened to them.”While the nature of the womens’ arrival in the UK means most have no support network, the choir offers a chance to make friends.“You laugh, you eat together, we don’t have that, we don’t have a family here, we’re more alone,’’ says Olawaniotogun.“We’re like a family. That’s why, when we sing, we sound amazing! Because we’re bonded like sisters.”The choir provides a weekly meal and travel expenses to rehearsals and performances, allowing those in the process of seeking asylum, who often have extremely limited access to funds, to participate.A creche is provided for those with children. “It means you’re not put at a disadvantage because you have a child … and you can have a couple of hours where you’re not with your child, which – for any single mother – is huge,” Dickson says.Providing these facilities helps to promote a supportive atmosphere in which the choir can bond. It doesn’t always work out though, says Dickson.“It’s very hard for people whose trust has been betrayed consistently to hold on to anything that’s good in their lives. Even if you might prove to them time and time again: ‘I’m not going to let you down, I’m going to be here, what I say will happen,’ it can be very hard for them to trust that.“Sometimes you get things where people start talking together in little groups in their own language and undermine the group.“Some are unable to get past that insecurity – no matter how many times you talk to them – where in order to make themselves feel better, they have to make someone else feel worse. That’s something very common in people who have been traumatised. We work very hard to address these issues.”Dickson and her co-facilitator Anna Samant, who accompanies the women on the piano, aim to create a culture of respect by asking the women to sign a contract that they help to write when they join. “They understand that everyone has the right to their own religion and sexuality, and no one has the right to undermine that,” Dickson says.Samant and Dickson also try to foster a spirit of cultural awareness by putting together songs that incorporate musical traditions from the women’s countries of origin, such as Souallé, which blends a Guyanese folk song with one popular in Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.For Olawaniotogun, the ersity of the choir is a strength. “There are different people, new faces. You adjust and it’s really amazing.”Her favourite song to sing is Osprey, which begins with the lyrics: “Flying high, flying free, osprey on the wind you ride”.“Whenever you’re singing a song, it’s like you’re telling a story”, she explains. “Sometimes when I’m singing and the song attaches a meaning to me, it makes me cry because it’s so emotional."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bde93a24ec4bbd0eba4e8edc574be7042243952/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51d57e5741888ef01ec2e696440b168c","title":"corporate jargon ruining friendships template texts","story":"Instead of spending time with a friend, now you can send them a template text – a generic response explaining that you’re too busy.

Rowe declined.“He put his foot in my front door,” says Rowe, 33, laughing, “and said: ‘What’s wrong? I’m not getting the same buy-in as I did the first time around.’” Inevitably, Mr Buy-In became a legend in Rowe’s friendship group.How have we got to the point where we describe our personal relationships in language more befitting a corporate boardroom? It is not enough to hang out with friends: we schedule our meet-ups with the precision of a world leader at Davos, and even less joie de vivre. I’m at capacity right now, we intone solemnly to someone asking if we fancy a drink. How about we touch base in a few weeks, when I have more bandwidth?The most extreme example of how corporate jargon has infected our personal relationships is the emerging trend of friendship template texts. First seen in a now viral and much-maligned Twitter thread from the American writer and activist Melissa A Fabello, template texts are generic responses you can send to that friend in crisis you don’t want to talk to. “Hey!” reads Fabello’s suggested response to a friend asking for support. “I’m so glad you reached out. I’m actually at capacity  helping someone else who’s in crisis  dealing with some personal stuff right now, and I don’t think I can hold appropriate space for you.”“It’s about self-optimisation,” explains Prof André Spicer of the Cass Business School, the co-author of Desperately Seeking Wellness, an exploration of the wellness industry. He situates template texts within the broader rise of wellness culture, and with it the drive towards a better, optimised self. “How can you become perfect in your relationships? By going with canned scripts, you come up with what you think is a perfect response to something.”This fashionably optimised self also attends therapy regularly – therapy attendance rates rocketed in the late 90s and 00s – and is unabashed about applying its terminology to everyday life. By using pseudo-therapeutic language such as “holding space”, template text-writers signal that they are emotionally intelligent, savvy and respectful of other people’s boundaries. Ironically, such texts may have unintended negative effects.To someone in crisis, being on the receiving end of a template text could feel devastating. “If someone had sent me that message, I would have felt completely rejected,” says 27-year-old Anwen Hayward, a student from Cardiff. She suffered four bereavements earlier this year, and there have been many moments where she has reached out for support. “Often a fumbling response to a friend in need is far better,” Spicer explains, “because humans don’t always know how to respond a lot of the time.”There is also a performative element to template texts, which are usually shared online by right-thinking activists. “We look to social media and these canned messages to see what being a good friend looks like,” says Spicer. As such, they feed into the broader performance of online selfhood that Jia Tolentino wrote persuasively about in Trick Mirror. “The internet is defined by a built-in performance incentive … the main purpose of this communication is to make yourself look good.”Template texts represent the convergence of two forces – the drive towards optimisation and corporate culture. “The boundaries between work and life have become blurred,” says Spicer. “We’re encouraged to think about growing our human capital and see our personal relationships as if they are an economic enterprise to be carefully managed.” Hence the liberal use of corporate and therapy buzzwords such as “capacity”, “connecting”, and “emotional labour” in template texts.Emotional labour as a concept has been hugely distorted – when coined by the sociologist Arlie Hochschild in 1983, it referred to the onerous burden placed on service workers to appear happy at all times. In general, being a friend to someone is not emotional labour. If you think it is, you’re probably the one who is really hard work. “Twitter is a cesspool for this,” says Hayward. “One person misuses a term and it gets misused over and over again.” She chafes at the idea that friendship is a form of work. “Emotional labour isn’t having to text a friend. The term has been devalued. You could argue that every interaction is emotional labour because it expends work on your behalf. But that’s not what it is.”Why do we view friendships as if they are businesses to be maintained? Because as work has swelled to impinge on every aspect of our lives, each hour is a tiny unit of productivity to be carefully allocated. “These texts are the product of the increasing neoliberalisation of our world, where market metrics have colonised every dimension of our lives,” explains Dr Catherine Rottenberg, an expert in neoliberalism at the University of Nottingham. “Human beings are remade as specks of capital so that our relationship to ourselves and others becomes one of capital appreciation. Our relationships are perceived as forms of capital that need to be invested wisely in order to enhance the self’s overall value.”As our relationships with other people become transactional, dating is reconfigured as a business venture – hence Mr Buy-In. Capitalism has loosened the ties that once bound people to an unprecedented extent. Communities are ripped apart by gentrification deregulation and the erosion of workplace rights mean that we work longer hours in insecure employment for lower pay. “Neoliberalism has created a careless reality,” Rottenberg says. As people become estranged from each other, we reach for template texts to instruct us how to be empathetic, understanding human beings. “Our world – digitally mediated, utterly consumed by capitalism – makes communication about morality very easy but makes actual moral living very hard,” writes Tolentino in Trick Mirror.While it is easy to sneer at template messages, or view them as uncaring, we use scripts in our daily lives without even realising. “Much of everyday interaction is scripted anyway,” says Spicer. “These texts are an example of the informal scripts we learn over time becoming formalised and manufactured.” He emphasises that scripts can be helpful when people are in anxiety-provoking situations, and don’t know what to say.“I was irritated when I saw people mocking scripts,” says 24-year-old Kal Walters, from Idaho. In addition to working with autistic people as a care worker, Walters is on the spectrum herself, and her brother is also autistic. “Scripts help me navigate social situations where other people would intuitively pick up cues from other people and know how to respond,” Walters says. “Whereas I have to rely on a cheat sheet.” For someone with autism, scripts are a helpful way to navigate the bewildering maze of social interaction. “I don’t understand why people think it’s uncaring to use a script,” Walters adds.“For me, it shows that I do care, and I’m trying to accomodate someone else’s expectations and do the right thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fdc4a6b0d7e5614da82f754db92dc31bdba9847/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb9b6e279317f8631508e15c7bb66f14","title":"raleigh classic cycle repair deposit lost","story":"I need help to get my classic Raleigh Royal bicycle back from Yorkshire bike shop Ellis Briggs Cycles which has had it now for more than a year.

In February this year, Ellis Briggs said the work was done, and I paid a further £283 by bank transfer. I have been waiting ever since to get my frame back. In June I travelled to the shop, at which point he revealed that he had sub-contracted the work and, because he owed the painter money on other jobs, my frame was being retained.

Boris Johnson had barely stumbled out of bed, and Dominic Cummings even had time to turn his T-shirt inside out and undo his laces before the snapper arrived to photograph their artfully casual breakfast meeting shortly after 8am.The only sense of urgency was coming from Dilyn the Downing Street dog, who was scratching at the door, desperate to be let out. Then again, he had been dying to escape ever since he had made the mistake of catching Carrie’s eye at the dogs’ home. How dumb was that! Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine. Don’t play it again, Dilyn.This was the new normal for the People’s Government. A morning frenzy of inactivity. Before the election, Downing Street had been on high alert from six o’clock onwards every morning, with everyone listening to the Radio 4 Today programme dreading the moment a minister said something idiotic or was unable to answer a single question. But now that Classic Dom had banned anyone in government from appearing on a BBC programme so obviously biased that even Labour was questioning its impartiality, everyone could chill a bit.Just as Dom and Boris were settling down to eat a light breakfast of Shreddies and crushed valium with a Uri Geller spoon, as they tried to brainstorm ideas that might play well in northern towns they had never known existed before the previous Thursday, a panic-stricken aide burst into the kitchen. “It’s a disaster,” she garbled. “David Davis has somehow found his way on to the Today programme.”“How the hell did that happen?” Dom growled. “He is literally one of the dimmest members of the Tory party. And that’s really saying something.”“I’m not sure,” said the aide. “I guess he imagined the blanket omertà didn’t apply to ex-ministers.”“Shit, shit, shit. How can we be a one-nation party if we don’t all talk with one voice? Mine. Anyway, how bad is it?”“Pretty bad,” the aide admitted. “He’s already said that Boris believes in something ...”“No. But from now on, you’ll believe in whatever I tell you to,” Dom said, walking across the room to turn up the radio. “Now shut the fuck up as we listen to the rest of this.”Everyone fell silent as Davis explained his vision for the coming year. Of course there would be ergence with the EU. A great deal in some areas, not so much in others. And there would be very bumpy times ahead. But it was his considered opinion that the EU would eventually cave in, just as it had by offering Boris the same deal that he and Theresa May had rejected 18 months earlier, and that even if it didn’t then WTO rules would be no big deal as the whole country would be worse off under either scenario.People were just going to have to learn to accept that they would inevitably be let down by the new government. There were so many different new factions in the new Tory party – the old home counties heartlands and the former Labour voters in the north – that it would be impossible to keep everyone happy. So the simplest and fairest way forward was to let everyone down. Davis wasn’t called the master military tactician for nothing. Or at all.Dom picked up the radio and hurled it on to the floor. Fragments of metal and plastic sprayed across the room. Dilyn shrugged. He’d seen this all before. There were now four of them in this marriage. “Why does that idiot think I spent months coaching you to say nothing but ‘Get Brexit Done’?” Dom yelled. Boris kept his head down, avoiding eye contact. He knew better than to interrupt Dom when he was going off on one.“The whole point was to make everyone think Brexit was a done deal,” Dom continued. “Now that moron Davis has given the game away that Brexit has barely begun. Jesus wept! We were meant to have until at least the new year before people realised we were going to disappoint them. Happy sodding Christmas to you too, Dave.”The atmosphere was toxic inside No 10 for much of the rest of the day as Dom tried to work out how best to silence the BBC. What better way for a one-nation party to unite the country than to stop its most respected broadcaster from asking awkward questions of the People’s Government? All it needed was someone both gullible and biddable to oversee the hatchet job on the Beeb. Someone to replace Nicky Morgan.Dom undid his trousers and kicked the furniture as he wracked his brains for the right person. But there was no one better than Morgan. She had been the only woman during the election campaign who could be relied on to be sent on media rounds to explain how 31,000 nurses were really 50,000. Mainly because her maths was that bad. But she had already stood down as an MP. So he’d just stick two fingers up to the entire country, appoint her to the Lords and keep her in the cabinet. Brilliant. The People’s Government partly run from the unelected Lords.

If you’d like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can catch our latest Brexit Means … podcast here, and for daily updates head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.In case you spent the past few days on another planet, Boris Johnson secured an emphatic victory in the UK’s general election as voters backed his promise to “get Brexit done” and take the country out of the EU by 31 January.The Conservative party captured 365 of the 650 seats in the Commons, a comfortable majority of well over 70 and the party’s best showing in a parliamentary election since Margaret Thatcher’s win back in 1987.Labour, meanwhile, was plunged into bitter recriminations after the party won just 203 seats, its worst result in 84 years, as voters who had overwhelmingly voted to leave shied away from from the party’s ambiguous Brexit policy.Johnson’s gamble on calling an early vote to break MPs’ deadlock over Brexit paid off, and he will now move swiftly to ratify his deal. Brexit was the “irrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people”, the prime minister said. It will not, however, be plain sailing.The size of the Tory majority was welcomed at an EU summit in Brussels, with leaders feeling it would give Johnson free rein to decide his negotiating objectives and compromise in the talks where necessary. They are now waiting to see what incarnation of the PM will emerge now he is secure in Downing Street.But the French president warned Johnson continued regulatory harmonisation would be the price for protecting the flow of UK-EU trade. “The more ambitious the trade deal, the more we need regulatory harmonisation,” Emmanuel Macron said.The new European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said talks on the future relationship would drag on beyond 2020, with certain parts of the deal needing to be prioritised and others left for later. EU officials could take the initiative and request an extension themselves as a way out of the problem.Johnson has repeatedly said he would not extend the 11-month transition period during which the talks are supposed to be concluded and Michael Gove, a senior minister, confirmed categorically on Monday that the UK would have a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year.Sir Ivan Rogers, however, warned that Johnson’s large majority would not hand him any extra power in his negotiations with Brussels and that the time pressures created by his commitment not to extend the transition period could force Britain into accepting major concessions.The UK’s former envoy to the EU added that Johnson had still not resolved the central contradiction in his plans between wanting Britain to erge from EU rules, while also wanting a comprehensive trade deal in place in just a year’s time.Raoul Ruparel, Theresa May’s former special adviser on exiting the EU, said the UK did not appear to be “match fit” for the next phase of negotiations, with “a huge amount of work to be done” on the detail of what the UK wants and Whitehall “not ready to negotiate such a complex and wide-ranging agreement”.The new government planned to give Johnson’s Brexit bill its first and second readings and first vote on Friday after two days of swearing-in of MPs, the state opening of parliament and the Queen’s speech, Downing Street has said.After that Johnson will have only 15 or 16 sitting days left before 31 January to get the withdrawal agreement bill over the line, with some amendments possible – most likely on Northern Ireland trade and any request to extend the transition period extension, over which parliament may well want a say.The European parliament must also ratify the withdrawal agreement, with two plenary sessions planned on 13 and 29 January, in principle allowing trade talks to start from 1 February.That looks unlikely, however, since the withdrawal bill requires a prior statement of negotiating objectives to be first approved by the Commons – meaning Johnson and the government are finally going to have to say what form they really want the future relationship to take: Canada-plus? EEA? Norway?This is likely to be the central question of the coming few weeks.That’s on top of: the Department for Exiting the EU merging (rumour has it) with the Department for International Trade HMRC starting work on all the new processes and systems it will need in Northern Ireland and specialised committees being set up to work out the details for UK-Northern Ireland trade.Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish National party’s “overwhelming” election victory – it won 48 of the country’s 59 Westminster seats – gave her a clear mandate to hold a new independence referendum.Despite Johnson’s rejection of any such move, Scotland’s first minister said she would publish the blueprint for a second referendum next week.Jo Swinson quit as Liberal Democrat leader and apologised to her party for a dismal election in which she lost her seat and the party slipped to 11 MPs – but said she did not regret fighting on a defiantly pro-remain platform.In the , Timothy Garton Ash says with Brexit now a certainty, we can still champion the values we share with millions of other Europeans:The battle to keep Britain in the EU is lost the battle for a European England has only just begun. When we remainers marched in our hundreds of thousands through the streets of London, bearing our improvised posters and European flags, we were not just defending British membership in a particular set of European institutions. We were also defending a certain idea of Britain and, within that, a certain idea of England: open, tolerant, internationalist, civic and civil, attentive to the social foundations of inidual liberty and not just to its raw economic expression. These are values we share with millions of other Europeans. In this sense, we were also standing up for a European England. And we can do so still. In this hour of defeat I feel impelled to say, with George Orwell: I believe in England, and I believe that we shall go forward.The always well-informed Charles Grant, co-founder of the Centre for European Reform, reads the tea leaves.

Less conspicuous were those quietly packing their offices and saying goodbye to the building that, in some cases, they had worked in for decades.Of the 73 sitting MPs to lose seats in this election, 46 were Labour, seven were Conservative and six were Liberal Democrat. After the blow of being turfed out by constituents, former members of parliament are given a week to pack up their belongings before their security passes stop working on 19 December.For Tom Brake, the longest-serving Lib Dem MP ahead of Thursday’s vote, his first task after losing his seat of Carshalton and Wallington after 22 years was to talk to his staff about the terms of their redundancy. “Two of them have worked for me for more than 10 years,” he said. “In many ways this is potentially more traumatic for them than it is for me.”Following the announcement that he had lost his constituency to the Tories by 629 votes, Brake went home to sleep for two hours before getting up to attend a constituency surgery on Friday afternoon. “I explained to people that I wasn’t their MP but that I would take up the issue and pass it on to my successor,” he said. “On Saturday I had the prizes to present to the winner and runner-up of my Christmas card competitions, so I had to go and do that.”He added: “I guess for the first time in more than 30 years, when I wake up at the weekend, I won’t be thinking about what I need to be doing that day. I’ve been involved in politics since 1983 and it’s quite a demanding and relentless vocation and having a bit of time to think and relax will be exciting.”While Anna Soubry – the former Conservative who stood for the pro-EU Independent Group for Change in her Nottinghamshire seat of Broxtowe – said she hadn’t expected to be re-elected (she’d even cleared out her office ahead of polling day), she was clear that the blow of losing would come very hard to others. “When you leave a job – even when you’re sacked or made redundant – you get some period of notice and, you know, you have a farewell party and a card and everybody wishes you well, but in this game you are absolutely out on your ear,” she said. Citing the former Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson – who lost her seat of East Dunbartonshire to the SNP – as an example on the brutality of the system, Soubry said: “Her declaration was around 4am or something. She’s in Scotland, obviously … It is a real shock to her … You’ve got all that stuff to cope with, your profound feeling of loss and failure.“And then first thing on Friday morning, the parliamentary authority send an email saying ‘you have lost your seat and you can come and see us today, Saturday or Sunday’. You have just lost your job at 4am in the fucking morning and you’re in Scotland! I mean what world are people living in?”Labour’s Emma Dent Coad – who took Kensington from the Tories in 2017, only to lose the seat to them in this election – is still a local councillor in the constituency and plans to continue campaigning for justice for Grenfell residents. She also plans to see if the University of Liverpool will take her back to finish a PhD on ‘Constructing Modern Spain: politics and architecture under Franco 1939-1975’. “The earning a living bit is something I still need to resolve,” she said.Dent Coad says she lost her seat because of claims by remain-supporting advocates of tactical voting, published by publications including the  and Observer, that her Lib Dem rival – the former Conservative Sam Gyimah – was the most likely candidate to beat the Tories. In the end she lost to the Conservative candidate by 150 votes.“Obviously I’m gutted and I’ve had complete strangers bursting into tears on the bus when they see me, seriously. I’m not exaggerating – every time I go out, people shake me by the hand, wave, hug me or burst into tears.”As a qualified GP, Labour’s Paul Williams, who lost his seat of Stockton South, is slightly better equipped than most to find new employment. He continued to work as a doctor for two mornings a month as an MP, meaning he has kept his licence to practise. As well as continuing with medicine – and continuing to campaign for children with autism and veterans – his immediate priority will be spending time with his family.“My family has hardly seen me over the past six weeks and prior to that I was working away in London loads of the time,” he said. “I’ve got two young kids, a five-year-old and a seven-year-old, and I got to take them to school this morning.”Very few of the former MPs, almost all from opposition parties, say they will miss the opportunity to see Boris Johnson and his new majority government gloating from the green benches, nor the experience of working in the palace of Westminster. “It’s a horrible place to work actually,” says Dent Coad. “It’s really brutal, misogynistic and unkind … I’ve worked in very male-dominated environments before but that was the most horrible place I’ve ever worked as a woman.”For Soubry, the election result is the definitive end of a frantic period campaigning for a second referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU, and she’s looking forward to a break before figuring out the next step.“I’ve been working since I was 22 or 23 and – even though I’ve had two children – I’ve barely had more than a month off in 40 years,” she said. “I am actually looking forward to having a little time off, to work out what’s next and see what comes up. I’m open to offers. I want to work. I am only 63 and I want to earn my own living.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d16fa3bcb9803e05b7784f9510ce5df772999b4/524_807_4402_2641/master/4402.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9e877d5901b6766e72b5a33f8c16d87","title":"female scientists use less positive language about their work study finds","story":"Tendency of men to use words such as ‘excellent’ has effect on future citations of researchMale scientists are more likely than female ones to publish work that describes itself as “excellent”, “unique” or “novel”, experts have found – a swagger that appears to reap idends in respect of how often others reference the research.The team say this matters as citations have an impact on salary, whether a researcher secures grants and whether they receive promotions – areas where there is a well-known gender gap in favour of men.“A paper that is cited more often is going to be viewed by a promotions committee within a university as being more important than an article that is cited less often,” said Prof Anupam Jena, a co-author of the research from Harvard Medical School.Writing in the BMJ, Jena and colleagues report that they analysed the titles and abstracts of 101,720 articles in the field of clinical research – such as drug trials or health studies – published between 2002 and 2017. The gender of the first and last author was determined using a name-based algorithm.The team then searched these for 25 positive words, such as “robust”, “novel”, “remarkable” and “promising”.The analysis took into account factors that could have affected the findings, such as the journal, field of research and year of publication. Further analysis revealed that the finding was driven by differences in language among papers published in the most prestigious journals. The same trend was seen when the team looked at more than 6m papers in the life science field.For both fields, the team found positive words were associated with a higher rate of subsequent citations.Jena said there are probably many other examples of self-promotion that may differ between men and women, affecting careers. “This is just one lens into that phenomenon,” he said. In a linked editorial, Prof Reshma Jagsi from the University of Michigan and Dr Julie Silver of Harvard Medical School called on journals to tackle bias, saying the system should be changed rather than expecting women to simply boast more. One suggestion is a set of standards on the use of positive terms.They also call for research looking at whether positive terms are more likely to be removed in the editing process from studies by women. Heavy copyediting, they note, is more common in high-impact journals, where the new findings were most striking.Helen Wollaston, the chief executive of Wise, a campaign for women in science and engineering, welcomed the study. “It just shows the power of language – these subtle things that can make a big impact,” she said, adding that training of scientists in the power of language whatever their gender could be important. She said editors should be aware of subtle gender differences in how scientists described their work.Prof Athene Donald, of the University of Cambridge, said there was a growing body of research showing editorial processes could be biased when it comes to gender. “Here is another example when gender differences, probably imposed by unconscious cultural norms on both authors and editors, lead to ergent outcomes,” she said. “Because publishing itself has so much impact on career progression, this finding has significant implications. Academic processes and institutions need to pay much more attention to what gets published where, why and by whom.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b456551657a1e16eff4fded2dab30005ea5aeeb6/971_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b370f0c66b9cf0187a872082f738f70","title":"too many neets in croydon youth offender system say inspectors","story":"Report calls for learning programmes to tackle lack of education and employmentNearly a third of offenders aged 16 to 18 dealt with by London’s biggest youth offending service (YOS) are not in education, employment and training (Neet) – more than 10 times the proportion in the local population.The ision is the second largest in England and Wales. Inspectors have recommended that the Youth Crime Board, which governs the work of the youth offending services, develop learning programmes that would reduce the number of Neets in the system.The chief inspector of probation, Justin Russell, said: “A third of young people known to the YOS are not in post-16 education, employment or training. This is a much higher percentage than in the general population and needs to be addressed.”The findings are reflective of the wider societal issues that play a role in youth crime, serious violence and gangs. The recent case of 14-year-old Jaden Moodie, who was stabbed to death by another teenager, highlighted such complexities, with both victim and perpetrator grappling with challenging life experiences.The inspectorate report said there were high levels of vulnerability for adolescents, including exploitation, domestic abuse and going missing from home, care and education.Youth offending services supervise 10– to 18-year-olds who have been sentenced by a court or who have come to the attention of the police because of their offending behaviour but have not been charged.The inspectorate concluded that the Croydon ision “requires improvement”, though it said the issues were partly due to inadequate practices in children’s social care. Ofsted rated Croydon children’s social care inadequate in 2017, the report noted.Russell said: “At its best, joint work provides children with an effective safety net, with professionals taking timely actions to mitigate the identified risks to children. In other cases, we found that inadequate practice in the children’s social care department left the YOS in a difficult position in trying to keep children and the public safe, with the YOS having to manage these risk by themselves.”The government has previously been warned that it cannot arrest its way out of the serious violence problem experienced in the capital and other cities as it looks to restore police officer numbers cut over the last nine years.The serious violent crime strategy, published in 2018, said violent crime, like other types of crime and antisocial behaviour, had a clear link to “poor life outcomes” including low educational attainment, poor health including mental health, unemployment, socio-economic factors, weak ties to family and exclusion rates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbff2376710ebc907cdb3573b0cbb19325f92dbd/0_0_2614_1568/master/2614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6508b12a8e49398b65bd53481c482518","title":"bernie ecclestone tamara jewellery raid possibly an inside job","story":"Former F1 boss says burglary at daughter Tamara’s house was an ‘awful thing to happen’The former Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has said he believes the theft of £50m worth of jewellery from his daughter’s property was an “inside job”.Tamara Ecclestone was said to have been left “shaken” by the burglary at her London home on Friday night which happened after she left the country for her Christmas holidays.Scotland Yard investigators say they are keeping an open mind about the raid on the house near Hyde Park.However, Bernie Ecclestone, 89, said on Monday: “I don’t have all the facts but given all the security at the house, I’m assuming it was an inside job.“It’s an awful thing to happen just after she had left the house to go to Lapland. Although maybe it’s better that she wasn’t in at the time.”Tamara Ecclestone – who posted an image on her Instagram account last week of a child at the steps of what appeared to be a private jet, followed by another a day later seemingly from an overseas destination – posted a biblical verse on Monday in what some followers interpreted as a reference to the theft.“For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open,” read the lines from Luke 8:17.Her husband, the former city trader Jay Rutland, posted an image on Instagram with the words: “I know u are lying but continue.”Thieves are believed to have entered through the garden before breaking into safes hidden in the bedroom of the house in central London.All of Ecclestone’s jewellery is understood to have been taken. Police used sniffer dogs to search the grounds of the property, and are looking through CCTV.The Sun reported that intruders fled with items including rings, earrings and an £80,000 Cartier bangle given to her as a wedding present.A spokesman for Tamara Ecclestone said: “I can sadly confirm there has been a home invasion. Internal security are co-operating with police in this matter.“Tamara and family are well but obviously angry and shaken by the incident.The politan police said officers were called to a residential property in Palace Green at 11.11pm on Friday to reports of a burglary and that a “fast-paced investigation” was underway.DS Matthew Pountney, from Central West command unit, said: “A number of officers, including the dog unit, deployed to the residential property, in Palace Green, W8. However, the suspects had already left the scene when the call to police was made.”“At this time we are investigating this as an isolated burglary and we are retaining an open mind around other lines of enquiry.“Police were called by security within the building to three males who had been present inside the property and a fast-paced investigation is underway to locate the suspects and missing items.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff4a956bec801b95920248ffbbf6f87ee5257182/0_109_5507_3305/master/5507.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc71d339b5fffd47ccec0053ffee443a","title":"champions cup revamp 18 teams two legged semi finals","story":"Changes to the structure of the Champions Cup are being considered with some stakeholders keen to reduce the competition to 18 teams. Organisers are pushing for a final decision within weeks as they look to guarantee the future of the tournament beyond 2022 when existing commercial and broadcasting contracts expire.Europe’s flagship club tournament involves 20 teams in five pools of four but it is understood discussions are continuing about the possibility of switching to six pools of three, featuring the top six sides from the Premiership, Pro 14 and Top 14.This could free up sufficient space in the packed calendar for money-spinning home and away semi-finals, as has long been the case in football’s Champions League.This format has yet to be agreed but the idea is believed to be attracting more support than a rival proposal to cut the field to 16 teams. One of the attractions of an 18-team competition would be to prevent teams from the same country from meeting each other in the pool stages, as has been the case again this year.With European Professional Club Rugby looking to put in place a range of commercial and broadcasting deals beyond 2022, Premiership Rugby’s new relationship with the private equity firm CVC has also led to some speculation about the potential implications for the supposed jewel in Europe’s club crown, particularly given only three teams – Leinster, Toulon and Saracens – have won the trophy since 2010.The EPCR’s director general, Vincent Gaillard, confirmed his organisation has not yet been approached by CVC and has called on stakeholders to underline their commitment to Europe early in the new year.“We need to have some certainty for the direction of the tournament,” he said. “We have received a very clear mandate from the board for the process to be concluded shortly. We are discussing whether there might be potential for change or improvement but if the desire is to stay with a 20-team Champions Cup that’s what we’ll do. We’re not in a bad place, we just need to project ourselves into the future.”With CVC also considering investing in the Top 14 and the Six Nations, however, Gaillard accepts there is an increasing need for clarity in a fast-changing sporting landscape. “Will others come up with plans of their own? Possibly but I just don’t see weakening Europe as a desirable scenario for anyone, not even CVC. From a sporting and commercial standpoint it is a very profitable venture for everyone.“The most important thing for me is that the financial world should not negatively affect player welfare or sporting calendars. We’re keeping a watchful eye but there is nothing so far that suggests that will be the case.”EPCR is also optimistic Brexit will not undermine sporting cross-border relationships. “On the basic logistical level there is no immediate concern because a transition period will be involved,”Gaillard said. “On a political level does it change anything? I don’t think it does. I think Britain is part of the future of European rugby. I can hardly see, say, England disappearing from the rugby map any time soon. I think European rugby is part of their future and vice versa, no matter what the politics around it might be.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7387f1975117fec1aba5dd4353d14190bb607cc3/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f86cc17b48c6f2aa2e315431de92a01","title":"top 10 theatre shows of 2019","story":"Katori Hall gave us a miracle, Caryl Churchill delivered a dark quartet and Tom Hiddleston astounded in Betrayal. But the year’s highlight was a breathtaking Ibsen with Hayley AtwellThis was the kind of show you want to see at an international festival: something that experiments with both form and content. Conceived and directed by Milo Rau and presented by NTGent, it was about the theatrical process while also inquiring into a notorious homophobic murder outside Liège in 2012. No definitive explanation of the motive was offered. What was shocking was the realisation that, at the eventual trial, the victim was viewed as the guilty party because he was gay. Read the full review.This was no mere reheating of Richard Eyre’s original 2004 production. Instead, it acquired new drive and heart. Zizi Strallen, as the flying nanny, was an intriguing mix of bullying briskness and heavenly solicitude. You’d also have to be a pretty hardened soul not to be astonished by the sight of Charlie Stemp airily tapdancing while suspended upside down from the proscenium arch. Read the full review.Caryl Churchill, ever experimental, put together four short plays dealing with myths, murder and our need for stories. I found Glass strangely opaque, but I loved the longest piece, Imp, about a couple of non-kissing cousins bound together for life by a long-buried secret. Both Deborah Findlay, given to sudden murderous rages, and Toby Jones, a depressive with a taste for running, were memorable, and the whole evening was a danse macabre tinged with dark comedy. Read the full review.Caroline Steinbeis’s revival of this 1912 play by Githa Sowerby outstripped a later one at the National. There was no fancy directorial footwork: simply a rapt attention to a riveting text that shows a Tyneside glassworks owner confronting the fact that his day is done. Owen Teale was excellent as the crumbling patriarch and Laura Elphinstone left one gutted by the scene where she realises that her lover’s ultimate loyalty lies not with her but with her father. Read the full review.How does one find a new angle on Pinter’s study of the corrosive nature of betrayal? Jamie Lloyd stripped the action to the bone. The focus was on the play’s psychological intricacy and on the performers. Tom Hiddleston, stricken by the revelation of his wife’s affair, Zawe Ashton as the free-spirited Emma and Charlie Cox as the blithely sensual Jerry all left an indelible impression. Read the full review.Robert Icke took a little-known play by Arthur Schnitzler about Viennese antisemitism, Professor Bernhardi, and turned it into a parable for our times. Juliet Stevenson played, unforgettably, a secular Jew who runs a prestigious clinic and attracts toxic publicity when she prevents a Catholic priest ministering the last rites to a dying girl. Icke’s version, which cast actors irrespective of gender or colour, was about both medical ethics and identity politics, and was the highlight of his Almeida career. Read the full review.Royal and Derngate, NorthamptonReligious faith is rarely explored on the modern stage. Katori Hall’s fine play, however, dealt both with the apparent visitation of the Virgin Mary to a trio of Rwandan schoolgirls in 1981 and the political tension between Tutsi and Hutu that led to genocide in 1994. Balancing the miraculous and the material, James Dacre’s production put a whole world on stage and Gabrielle Brooks, Yasmin Mwanza and Pepter Lunkuse showed the isions among the supposed visionaries. Read the full review.John Kani encompassed a large slice of South African history in his play about a testy encounter between two men. Antony Sher played a cantankerous old actor dreaming of playing King Lear and riddled with racial prejudice. Kani himself played his carer, angry at the inequalities of a post-apartheid society. Both actors were magnificent in a production directed by Janice Honeyman that suggested a love of Shakespeare was the one unifying factor. Read the full review.Helen Edmundson’s adaptation of Andrea Levy’s novel was a big event: an account of how aspiring Jamaicans left one small island in 1948 to arrive in another with great expectations tragically unfulfilled. The play coincided with revelations about Britain’s treatment of the Windrush generation but its strength lay in its portrait of iniduals: Leah Harvey and Gershwyn Eustache Jnr caught perfectly the trials of a couple struggling with postwar reality and Rufus Norris’s production combined the intimate and the epic. Read the full review.Duke of York’s, LondonI’d rate this one of the best Ibsen productions I’ve ever seen, along with Katie Mitchell’s Ghosts, Ingmar Bergman’s The Wild Duck and Peter Hall’s John Gabriel Borkman. Ian Rickson turned a complex, tantalising play into a more political Tristan and Isolde with John Rosmer and Rebecca West seen as heartbroken romantics driven inexorably to suicide by an oppressive past and an imperfect present. It helped that there was palpable erotic tension between Tom Burke as a Rosmer floundering through loss of faith and Hayley Atwell as a radical Rebecca imprisoned by her memories. But everything about this production felt right. Duncan Macmillan’s adaptation was sharp without being intrusive, Rae Smith’s design reminded us of the ever-present mill wheel, Neil Austin’s lighting showed the gloom-shrouded Rosmer mansion being fitfully illumined. There was a host of strong supporting performances from Giles Terera, Jake Fairbrother, Peter Wight and Lucy Briers. You were constantly aware of servants longing for the freedom that Rosmer and Rebecca earnestly talk about. A dark, difficult play was given abundant life.

Whether your priority is two-day battery life, fantastic camera performance or a spectacular screen, there’s plenty to choose from.This  buyer’s guide to top-end smartphones was last updated on 17 December 2019, and represents the best available models at the time. As new models are released and tested, this guide will be updated to help you choose the right flagship phone for you.Welcome to one of the ’s new buyer’s guides.

The OnePlus 7T Pro is a minor update to the stellar OnePlus 7 Pro that keeps all the good bits, improves the camera, and speeds up the fingerprint scanner.The monster 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED screen runs at 90Hz – compared with 60Hz for most of the competition – is arguably the best in the business. It’s bright, crisp and super smooth, plus it’s free of holes or camera notches. The selfie camera pops up from the top on command – a consistent crowd-pleaser.The 7T Pro is the fastest-feeling phone – everything zips along. It has Qualcomm’s top chip, the Snapdragon 855+, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of fast UFS3.0 storage – plenty for practically everything. The optical in-display fingerprint scanner is even faster than before continuing to put the competition to shame.The latest OxygenOS 10, the firm’s super-slick version of Android 10, is arguably the best in the business too, and you’ll get prompt updates for three years.The triple camera system on the back is good too, combining a 48MP main, a 16MP ultra-wide angle and an 8MP telephoto camera. New for the 7T Pro is a super-macro mode, which is surprisingly good, producing crisp images up to just 2.5cm from the lens – great fun. The 7T Pro can’t quite beat the iPhone 11 Pro or Pixel 4XL, but it matches or beats the rest on detail and utility.Dual-sim support is handy for work or travelling. It’s water resistant to some extent, but has no IP rating. There’s a McLaren limited edition and a 5G version in the US, but not UK where the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G is still the current model.The unrivalled screen, sheer speed and in-display fingerprint scanner, combined with the slick OxygenOS 10 make even mundane tasks a joy. The massive OnePlus 7T Pro is a stretch worth making.Buy if: you want the best and fastest superphone experienceDon’t buy if: you don’t want to stretch to such a big phoneGood things come in smaller packages. The iPhone 11 Pro isn’t the biggest or the most expensive of Apple’s 2019 smartphones, but it is the best and very nearly the best phone of the year.The iPhone 11 Pro combines a stunning, big-enough 5.8in screen, svelte, luxurious-feeling body, top-notch performance and battery life to keep up with most of the competition.Truth be told, the design is basically uncharged since the mould-breaking iPhone X from 2017. The back is now frosted glass, which looks particularly good in silver, and has a triple camera lump in the top left. The rest stays pretty much unchanged.Apple’s Face ID is still the best, most widely-supported face recognition system in the business. The new A13 Bionic chip continues to lead the pack. The gesture navigation system continues to be one of the best, and you’re in line for around five years of iOS software updates from release - at least two more than any other manufacturer will provide.This year the iPhone 11 Pro introduces a significantly improved triple camera with ultra-wide, wide and telephoto lenses, which matches the best rivals in photography and beats them in video. It even has an effective night mode now.It’s not all gravy – starting with just 64GB of storage is poor. The old Lightning connector still persists, rather than the newer standard of USB-C. There’s no 5G option and it is exceedingly expensive – you don’t buy the iPhone 11 Pro looking for value for money. Plus iOS 13 has been a mixed bag since its introduction, with a lot of bugs that needed fixing.But as a whole, no other phone can match the iPhone 11 Pro in power, capability and size. The iPhone 11 Pro is the smaller phone to buy and the best running iOS.You want the best smaller phone, or simply the best Apple phone, then the iPhone 11 Pro is fantastic, but comes at a considerable costBuy if: you want the best iPhoneDon’t buy if: you don’t want to spend £1,049 or want to use AndroidIf you want the Android sweet-spot between a big, stunning screen and smaller phone size that’s easier to handle and fit in a pocket, that’s the Galaxy S10.The 6.1in QHD+ AMOLED screen with a small hole-punch notch in the top right is one of the best on the market and is big enough to make the most of apps and movies look great.Small bezels all round make the phone pretty compact compared with rivals, and it’s light too. It’s still a glass and metal sandwich, which means you might need a case to protect against falls.The Galaxy S10 was recently updated with Samsung’s new One UI 2 software, based on the latest Android 10 including much-improved navigation gestures. You should get about three years of software support from release from Samsung, although the company is usually slower than Google and OnePlus to deliver big Android version updates.The rear triple camera is good allowing you to zoom from 0.5 through 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom. It won’t beat the Pixel 4 XL or iPhone 11 Pro, but gets the job done. The selfie camera pokes straight though the screen and is one of the better ones on the market.Performance is good but battery life is a bit weak, lasting a day of usage but not much more. The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor mounted under the display has proved to be a bit slow and finickity over time, which can be annoying.A big screen Android experience in a relatively small phone is the main selling point, but the good camera, performance and looks help too.Buy if: you want a good balance of screen and phone size without breaking the bankDon’t buy if: you want brilliant battery lifeThe best camera on a phone is the Huawei P30 Pro by some margin. Even at the end of 2019, no other phone provides as comprehensive a combination as Huawei’s new Leica quad camera.The 20MP 0.6x ultra-wide angle camera is fun, the main 40MP camera is terrific and it’s joined by a new periscopic 5x optical zoom camera that gets you closer than any other smartphone. If five times magnification wasn’t enough, there’s an excellent 10x hybrid zoom on top and then a digital zoom all the way up to 50x. A 3D depth-sensing time-of-flight sensor rounds out the modules on the back.Remarkable levels of zoom aside, the P30 Pro also has low-light performance that instantly turns night into day without having to wait for a couple of seconds of capture. The P30 Pro might not have the best Night Sight rival, but most of the time it simply doesn’t need it.The rest of the phone is excellent, too, with stunning colour options. The large 6.47in FHD+ OLED is great, with a small notch in the top containing the selfie camera and slim bezels all round. The curved edges keep the width of the phone to a narrow 73.4mm wide, meaning it’s still relatively manageable and easier to wield day-to-day particularly compared with the OnePlus 7T Pro or iPhone 11 Pro Max.The in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is second only to the OnePlus 7T Pro’s. Huawei’s Kirin 980 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, provides great performance and a battery that will last about two days. Plus the battery charges super fast and has wireless charging and power sharing.Huawei’s modified Android 10, EMUI 10, is highly customisable and has plenty of features but may not be to everyone’s tastes. Huawei is still facing sanctions from the US as part of the US-China trade war, which makes its future uncertain. The P30 Pro’s recent Android 10 update showed that it should continue to receive updates as normal, however.The camera is game-changing in meaningful, not gimmick-filled ways, while the rest of the phone is excellentBuy if: you want the best camera on a great phoneDon’t buy if: you want a smaller phone or are worried about US blockade of HuaweiPound for pound the OnePlus 7T offers the best performance, design and experience than any other smartphone.It’s got the big, good-looking 6.41in full HD OLED screen, with a small, widow’s-peak-like notch at the top for a selfie camera. New for the 7T is a 90Hz refresh rate, which like its bigger sibling the 7T Pro, makes even the mundane silky smooth.It’s got 2019’s top-of-the-line Snapdragon 855+ processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of fast UFS3.0 storage. It also lasts a good 31 hours on a charge, and its OxygenOS 10 Android software is fast and slick. OnePlus guarantees two years of software updates and an additional year of bi-monthly security updates from the release date of the phone too.It even has the fastest and best in-display fingerprint scanner currently available, which is as good as the best dedicated capacitive sensors, good haptics and dual-sim support for having two mobile phone network connections at the same time.The triple camera is good too, with ultra-wide, wide and 2x telephoto lenses, plus a dedicated macro mode, but it can’t beat the very best in the market. There’s no formal water resistance rating and no wireless charging, but WarpCharge sees it hit full charge in 60 minutes flat.A great 90Hz screen, excellent software and the best performance, in-display fingerprint scanner and a good camera mean you have to spend significantly more to get a better phone than thisBuy if: you want a top-notch phone but don’t want to spend more than £549Don’t buy if: you want a really good cameraSmartphones are rated by screen size measured on the diagonal in inches. The bigger the number the larger the phone, but different phones use different ratios of height to width.How easy it is to handle comes down to the width of the phone and its weight. The narrower and lighter it is, the easier it is to hold in one hand and the less likely you are to drop it.What is commonly called the processor in a phone is actually a system-on-a-chip combining the processor, graphics and other essential systems into one.Generally the newer the processor the more powerful and battery efficient it will be. Samsung, Huawei and Apple make their own, while Qualcomm is the largest supplier to other brands at the high end, with its Snapdragon 8-series range at the top.The RAM (memory) is where your apps and processes are stored when in use, so the you more your phone has the better, up to a point.Android requires more RAM than iOS, so it\u0027s difficult to directly compare them. But with Android at least 4GB of RAM is currently recommended.Different from memory, storage is where everything is stored on the phone, including apps and media. While a few phones can have their storage expanded with microSD cards, most cannot.That means you should aim for 64GB of storage at a minimum, but more if you want to store lots of photos. Cloud services such as Spotify or Google\u0027s Photos can help offload your music, photos or videos to the internet.Keeping your phone secure from hackers is essential, which makes software updates critical to patch bugs and security holes, as well as adding new features and improving things such as battery life and the camera.Not all phones receive regular updates. Apple\u0027s support of older phones is the best in the business of around 5 years, followed by Samsung and Google\u0027s three years, both from when the phone was released - not when you buy it.Battery life varies drastically between devices, and all-day battery often doesn\u0027t mean 24 hours between charges. Some may not last long enough, particularly if you\u0027re out in the evening.Battery life gets worse as the battery ages too, so a two-day battery will likely make sure the phone lasts at least a day two years later.Cameras are the current battleground between the big players, but the margins between them are slimming.Most use computational photography that combines hardware with advanced software algorithms, typically allowing multiple cameras to combine to make one image.As such the camera software makes as much difference as the hardware, and is one of the few areas that actually improves over time with updates.Multi-camera systems often offer more, such as useful zooms, portrait modes and better low-light performance, but they are not all created equally. There are also 3D cameras, which can detect facial expressions and other fun tricks.The number of megapixels (MP) also makes a difference. Having more MP doesn\u0027t necessarily equal a better image, but modern smartphone cameras combine multiple pixels to improve image quality producing 12MP shots from 48MP sensors, for example.Wireless charging:\u0026nbspconvenient, but slower than via cable and normally a charging pad doesn\u0027t come in the boxDurability:\u0026nbspgenerally glass on the front and back of the phone makes it more fragileResale value:\u0026nbspiPhones hold their value better than most othersOLED versus LCD: OLED screens emit their own light so have much deeper blacks and more vibrant colours, while LCD screens are cheaperThese are good phones still worth buying if none of the top smartphones fit the bill.Apple’s cheaper iPhone 11 is the follow-up to last year’s iPhone XR and offers most of the features of the iPhone 11 Pro. It has slightly battery life too, but is missing the excellent ultra-wide angle camera, has a slightly larger, but worse screen. It is made of aluminium and glass, instead of stainless steel, losing its luxurious feel and the knowledge that it’s the best Apple can make.The iPhone 11 looks great in red or white, but it’s not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, costing as much or more as true flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 11 certainly holds its own for the money, but the iPhone 11 Pro still the one to buy if you want the best iPhone. If you want a cheaper phone, switch to Android or buy last year’s iPhone XR.If you must have an iPhone and it must have a massive screen or epic battery life then the iPhone 11 Pro Max is your only option. But it has really poor ergonomics, is big, expensive and heavy, making the smaller iPhone 11 Pro or iPhone 11 are better options.The smallest, cheapest variant of Samsung’s current S10 line is still good, but falls slightly short of the high bar set by the regular Galaxy S10. The Galaxy S10e loses the optical zoom with only two cameras on the back, has a flat, slightly smaller screen and a lower capacity battery. It also ditches in the in-screen fingerprint scanner for one embedded in the power button – great for right-handed users but not so for the left handed.It doesn’t feel any smaller in the hand, but can be had for less if you must have a top-end Samsung for the lowest possible cost or dislike curved screens.The bigger version of the Galaxy S10 with a 6.4in QHD+ display has the best screen available on any device. The oval-shaped hole-punch notch is novel, containing two good selfie cameras. The triple rear camera is good, but not a patch on the Huawei P30 Pro. Performance is good, so is the software, but the battery life is slightly disappointing compared with the best. The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow and can be frustrating to use.The Galaxy Note 10+ is a Samsung super-fan’s dream. It has the biggest screen on a Samsung with a monstrous 6.8in on the diagonal, new faster UFS3.0 storage, reasonable battery life and plenty of party tricks. The stylus can now be used as a magic wand for gestures, there are three cameras on the back and is available in a 5G version too. The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow and can be a bit frustrating to use.The biggest, most powerful version of Samsung’s S-line is the S10 5G and it’s huge with a 6.7in QHD+ AMOLED screen, long oval-shaped hole-punch notch for the selfie cameras, and four cameras on the back. Performance, software and battery are good, but it’s not as slick or ergonomic as the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G. The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow and can be frustrating to use.The Mate 20 Pro has the big, attractive 6.39in QHD+ screen, svelte body, long battery life and great performance that made it the top phone of 2018. However, its excellent triple camera system with 3x optical zoom has been outdone by Huawei’s newer P30 Pro, which has a Leica quad camera with 5x optical zoom. It recently received EMUI 10 (Android 10) and is worth looking out for deals, particularly if you want the 3D face unlock option.The Google Pixel 4 XL is a mixed bag. On the one hand you have a good-looking 6.3in QHD+ AMOLED display running at 90Hz, a stellar camera, new Soli radar gesture system, amazing new on-device AI and super-fast 3D Face Unlock. But on the other you have no fingerprint scanner, meaning until apps are updated to use the Face Unlock you’re forced back to using the old pin or password, the battery life is fairly short and there have been quite a few bugs that have needed fixing since launch. One day it might be great.Xiaomi’s first slider phone offers more than most for the money, with top-flight specs for 2018 competing directly with the OnePlus 6T and Honor View20. It takes a different approach to the problem of where to put the selfie camera in an all-screen design, hiding it behind the screen on slide-out section.Good, but quite as great as its competition, this huge phone is held back by a heavy weight and a software experience that just isn’t as good, despite solid gesture navigation options.Google Pixel 4 - Great phone utterly ruined by terrible battery life - £669Razer Phone 2 - Gaming phone beast that falls down on camera performance – £500Sony Xperia XZ3 – Good, but not great phone that misses the mark – £699 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Today, the Friends of Friendless churches keep the doors open to more than 50 of these treasuresThe Friends of Friendless Churches (FoFC) is a small charity that works to save places of worship across England and Wales, many of which face abandonment and ruin as a result of shrinking populations in rural areas.Founded in 1957 by Welsh journalist and former MP Ivor Bulmer-Thomas – a leading layman in the Church of England – the charity aims to preserve beautiful churches as public monuments that should be rightly recognised as “dispersed world heritage sites” and important components of our cultural legacy. The founding members included politician Roy Jenkins, artist John Piper, poet TS Eliot, and poet and conservation campaigner John Betjeman.According to Friends director Rachel Morley, through his vociferous campaigning Bulmer-Thomas “almost singlehandedly changed the fate of parish churches”. Having witnessed the demolition of St Peter the Less Church in Chichester in 1960, he vowed to prevent similar acts of cultural vandalism from occurring again. Bulmer-Thomas believed that “an ancient and beautiful church fulfils its primary function merely by existing. It is, in itself, and irrespective of the members using it, an act of worship. Their message is delivered – not for half hours on Sundays, but every hour of every day of every year, and not merely to those who enter, but to all who pass by.”Though Bulmer-Thomas was himself a devoted churchgoer, the mission of the Friends is not a religious one. Morley says that “we are an architectural conservation organisation”, and the aim of the Friends is to preserve beautiful places of worship as public monuments. The churches are, according to Morley, our “greatest architectural and cultural legacy … equivalent to the great cultural treasures of places such as Tuscany, Istanbul and Andalucía.”The Venerable Ambrose Mason, Archdeacon of Monmouth, says: “It is the local congregation that has the responsibility for looking after the buildings, their repair and maintenance, and if something really serious crops up – a congregation of perhaps elderly people say ‘we just can’t raise a quarter of a million pounds to repair the roof’,” so, in many cases, the decision has to be made to “walk away from the building”.This often results in churches being labelled as “unviable”, after which alternative uses for them are sought by church authorities. Morley says: “In the 1950s, many were demolished, whereas now there are better systems in place within the church commissioners and the diocese for finding an outcome.” However, this often means the buildings slip out of the “shared national heritage” into private ownership – converted into private dwellings or offices with little to no public access. Archdeacon Mason says the Friends “provide a vital role in helping to preserve the more significant local churches where the congregations have dropped to a point where they are not viable”.Morley says “These buildings are beautiful and important in and of themselves. We do not need to justify their continued existence by turning them into cafes or social security offices. The parish churches of England and Wales contain the most important art and architecture and they are vulnerable.” Many churches that are sold often appear cheap at point of purchase but due to the expense of conversion – few have electricity or water – fall into disrepair and are left locked and abandoned.The Friends has a membership of 2,000 and relies on a network of 200 volunteers around the country to keep their eyes on the buildings. Julia Pound happily describes herself as an “accidental church warden” after moving in to the property next door to Ayshford Chapel, which is cared for by the Friends. She describes her role as “sweeping it out once a week and making sure it looks loved”.In the case of St Mary the Virgin in Llanfair Kilgeddin, in Monmouthshire, the church has been cared for by a local man, Maurice Trumper, for over 25 years . The church was saved from demolition in the 1980s in what Friends chairman Roger Evans described as “a rallying point for the conservation movement” following a “tooth and nail” battle with the Church in Wales to save it. The church, an Arts and Crafts masterpiece with its original, fully restored sgrafitto paneling by George Heywood Sumner, is now the Friends’ “pride and joy”, according to Evans.Morley gives the example of the sgrafitto panels at Llanfair when describing the importance of the churches being viewed in the context of the landscapes around them. One extraordinary panel, O ye Mountains and Hills, features the landscape directly outside the church walls – the River Usk, Sugar Loaf Mountain and the tower of the nearby church of St Michael’s in Llanfihangel Gobion. Before the Friends intervention in the 1980s, the panels were scheduled to be pulled out and sent to a museum, while the rest of the building was demolished. Morley says: “The art and artwork in churches is worthy of being in any national museum. What is brilliant is that it is in context, and that could be in the middle of a field or sitting at the side of a road, and that is hugely important. Most of our churches are open 247 and we want the public to enjoy them and celebrate them because we are so lucky to have them.”The perseverance on behalf of the local communities surrounding the churches is demonstrated by the case of St Mary of the Angels in Brownshill, Gloucestershire, when in 2011 villagers purchased the church from the diocese and entrusted its care to the Friends in perpetuity. One of the great fears of the FoFC is that short-sighted decisions on behalf of church authorities looking to balance the books could seriously and irrevocably damage the nation’s greatest architectural legacy – removing centuries old buildings from existence or public access over the course of a single generation. Nearly half of the Grade I-listed buildings in England are churches, and around 30 are put up for sale or closed every year.The Friends receive no public funding in England and only modest support from the Church of Wales. Otherwise, they are entirely reliant on support from their members and donations from the general public. Though many churches petition the Friends for support, they don’t have the budget to rescue all those that are in need. In fact, the organisation has a long list of churches that are under threat or that in some cases have been closed and have stood locked and deteriorating for over 12 years. “There are more churches added to our list every quarter. Some have been on this list for well over a decade,” says Morley.The Friends stress that cared for and cherished should not mean fossilised, and instead they want offer their churches for public events such as concerts, knitting groups, seasonal lectures, art exhibitions, supper clubs and the occasional religious ceremony. They intend to carry on working tirelessly to preserve what Shakespeare described as our magnificent “sermons in stone” for generations to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd2e322c7bdffd886ec020f2f9b0c0bf18e2ebae/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68892cf308cdda9c8161202ed187e838","title":"10 best uk rural art galleries england wales scotland","story":"From the Hebrides to Land’s End, rural galleries showcase work that reflects the local area and make for great days out with lovely walks and homemade cake thrown inThe light and landscapes of the Hebrides have long been a huge draw for artists, and there are several small galleries dotted around the white sand bays, crags and bogs of beautiful Harris.

Bannon left the administration in 2017 after playing a key role in the US president’s equivocation over a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which was widely condemned, but remains influential.“We’ve turned the Republican party into a working-class party,” said Bannon, relaxing at a table with an autographed photo of Trump behind him. “Now, interestingly, we don’t have any elected representatives who believe that, but that’s a legacy issue. We’ll get over that. We’ve got to find our AOCs.”Ocasio-Cortez, a 30-year-old former bartender from New York, was elected to Congress last year and has built a huge social media following as a member of “the Squad”, a group of four progressive women of colour. Her eagerly sought presidential endorsement went to fellow progressive senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.The Democrats and their supporters have “better casting”, Bannon admitted. “They did an amazing job in 18. I keep saying I admire AOC. I think her ideology’s all fucked up, but I want her. I want to recruit bartenders. I don’t want to recruit any more lawyers. I want bartenders.”Congressional Republicans are dominated by ageing white men from comfortable backgrounds. Among Democrats, Bannon also pointed to military veterans such as Max Rose of New York and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, both elected as the party swept the House of Representatives in 2018. “That’s perfect casting. That’s why we got smoked.”Democrats were boosted in the midterms by Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, who spent $110m through his own political action committee. An impressive 21 of the 24 candidates he supported won their races. Bloomberg is now also running for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2020 US election.“People are missing the point about Bloomberg,” said Bannon, who co-hosts a radio programme about Trump’s impeachment called War Room. “Trump wouldn’t be impeached if it were not for Bloomberg. It’s Bloomberg’s hundred million dollars that won the seats … The Democrat party is just like Republicans: a pass through. There’s no actual people to do anything. They’re not out in any state ringing doorbells. Those activist groups are. That’s where Bloomberg put his hundred million dollars.”In a second interview by phone last week, Bannon drew parallels with the British general election, in which Conservative Boris Johnson trounced Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn, accused of failing to stamp out antisemitism in the party. Johnson took a wrecking ball to a “red wall” in traditional working-class areas, just as Trump broke through the “blue wall” in midwestern states in the 2016 election.“I think it’s a victory for populism,” Bannon said, “Obviously radical economic ideas and socialism and more government involvement, coupled with virulent antisemitism, is not a winning ticket. I believe the Democratic party here, particularly on the far left – the Squad, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders – should embrace the lessons because I don’t believe it was just Corbyn’s personality.”He added: “Obviously Corbyn had issues, a personality that seemed to rub people the wrong way, particularly some of his core voters, but this is much deeper than that and you just can’t just turn it off to ‘one guy was more popular than the other’. This was, I think, a very serious vote and people paid a lot of attention to this and wanted to get Brexit done.”Bannon said he was fascinated by focus groups he saw on British TV during the election campaign. “These were Labour voters and they were not going to vote for Labour and the reason was they kept asking, ‘How are these programmes going to be paid for?’ What I was most impressed with was the specificity and the granularity of the questions.“People don’t want to be spun any more. They don’t want to be BS’d any more. They want to know what you’re laying out and how you’re going to effectuate it and, most importantly, how you’re going to pay for it and ‘if paying for it means more increased taxes or less opportunities for me, you’re not going to get my vote no matter how good it sounds’.”He added: “I think the Democrats, on whether it’s Green New Deal or healthcare for illegal aliens or whatever, ought to take the lessons of the working class. These are lifetime Labour members that voted for a Tory.”Bannon regards Johnson as neither a nationalist nor a populist and likens the prime minister’s vision of Brexit to “Singapore-on-the-Thames” – very different from the version hoped for by those who voted for him. Even so, Bannon argues that both the Conservatives and Republicans should aim to seize their traditional rivals’ territory by appealing to the working class.Critics say Bannon is an ardent nationalist, nihilist and attention seeker hellbent on disrupting and destroying the political establishment. He suggests his desire to transform the Republican party as a working-class force stems from a worldview that pitches the elites against the so-called “deplorables”, a term based on a comment by Hillary Clinton that was widely seen as an insult to long-disparaged and forgotten people.“My whole theory on the right is that we if we want capitalism to survive, we need to make people capitalist. The problem is they’re not capitalists. We have oligarchs and serfs. That system is not going to survive. I tell the donors, you may hate me, but all your Paul Ryan bullshit at the Heritage Foundation can’t win national elections. He can’t win Wisconsin, OK? Donald Trump can.”The White House adviser Stephen Miller, a white nationalist, told Bannon in a 2016 radio interview that America could be “decimated” by immigration and lose its sovereignty. Bannon, who has worked with openly racist far-right leaders across Europe, denies that racial resentment is central to the resurgent populism – even though the FBI reported last month that personal attacks motivated by bias or prejudice have reached a 16-year high, with a sharp increase in violence against Latino people.The Trump administration has notoriously attacked workers’ rights, cutting the number of workplace safety inspectors, tightening qualifications for who must be paid the minimum wage or overtime and pushing trade unions to the margins.Bannon appears untroubled by having helped put a man endorsed by white nationalists in the Oval Office. “Look, this is what drives me nuts about the left. All immigration is to flood the zone with cheap labour, and the reason is because the elites don’t give a fuck about African Americans and the Hiic working class. They don’t care about the white working class either. You’re just a commodity.“So they have unlimited labour and they’re paying you nine bucks an hour. ‘Let more guys in and, by the way, it’s bigger markets.’ It destroys the working class. That’s what we’ve got to protect. Once we show working-class people of every ethnicity and race that you being a citizen you get a special deal, you get that realignment.”A former naval officer and Goldman Sachs investment banker, Bannon’s emphasis on citizenship would be unlikely to satisfy current US citizens who endure immense class, gender and race inequalities. The gap between the haves and have-nots grew last year to its highest level in more than half a century of tracking income inequality, according to US Census Bureau figures released in September. The independent not-for-profit CDC Foundation says black women are three to four times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as their white counterparts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10b4b02fd2033225b5fc8e22f2b51503e5c6e958/660_242_4475_2685/master/4475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e207e1bd0d5b3519badc05e902ab9fc","title":"france pensions chief jean paul delevoye resigns as transport strike enters 12th day","story":"Jean-Paul Delevoye falls victim to scandal over £100,000 in undeclared payments The French official leading a controversial pensions overhaul stepped down on Monday over a scandal involving undeclared payments, on the 12th day of a crippling transport strike against the proposal, imperilling the holiday plans of thousands.Jean-Paul Delevoye became the target of unions’ ire after admitting over the weekend he had failed to disclose 13 private sector posts, both paid and unpaid, in a recent asset declaration.One of his jobs, as president of the Parallaxe education thinktank, paid nearly €5,400 (£4,500) a month on top of his ministerial salary – money he should have forfeited under a 2013 political transparency law.“Jean-Paul Delevoye made these omissions in good faith. He will now be able to explain himself,” an official in the French presidency said, adding that Emmanuel Macron would name a new commissioner “as soon as possible”.Laurent Berger, the head of France’s largest union, the CFDT, called Delevoye’s omissions “shocking”, telling France Info radio that “they obviously damage his credibility”.The unions are demanding that Macron drop his plan to forge a single pensions system out of the existing 42 schemes – arguing that millions of people would have to delay their retirement to get a full pension.A day of road blockades by truckers demanding higher pay added to traffic jams on Monday as most metro lines in the capital were again closed or operating only a handful of trains.

But while others are patiently waiting for Netanyahu to step down on his own, Saar has been the only one who has dared to take him head on.Netanyahu faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three corruption cases in which he is accused of trading legislative or regulatory favours in exchange for lavish gifts or favourable media coverage. He denies wrongdoing and has waged an angry campaign against the media and law enforcement officials he said are bent on ousting him from office.Outwardly, Likud members have strongly supported their leader and joined in denouncing the alleged “coup” of the liberal elites against him.But Saar’s burgeoning insurrection has begun to reveal some cracks.Around 500 party activists attended the launch of the former education minister’s campaign to unseat Netanyahu, which has been buoyed by support from a half-dozen Likud lawmakers. That includes the powerful chairman of the party’s executive body. Saar, in a jab at Netanyahu’s inability to form a government, took the podium flanked by banners with his slogan: “Only Saar Can!”While Netanyahu’s various opponents across the political spectrum have called on him to resign because of his legal woes, Saar has kept saying the party needs a new leader because Netanyahu has been unable to form a stable coalition government. He has said the prime minister is unlikely to be able to again, if given another chance.Recent polls showed that with Saar as leader, Likud would make a more powerful bloc with its natural ultra-Orthodox and nationalist allies. Saar would also be in an easier position to create a national unity government with the centrist Blue and White party if, as expected, the upcoming March election produces a deadlock like the previous two rounds have.Blue and White have ruled out serving with Netanyahu because of his indictment.Even amid the political disarray, Saar’s challenge is a risky manoeuvre in a party that fiercely values loyalty and has had only four leaders in its 70-plus-year history. Netanyahu himself has denounced Saar as “subversive”.Earlier on Monday, Saar challenged Netanyahu to a policy debate in a video released on social media.“I am waiting for you, Mr prime minister, at any time and any place you choose,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f477f04413c935c8dce7d4d778d94abbd90b18b/0_9_1276_766/master/1276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dce50f1bf111fd883cfd39cd28b9288","title":"biscuit tin democracy the humble start of new zealands most progressive laws","story":"Numbers are drawn from a 30-year-old biscuit tin to decide which members’ bills will be debated in parliamentIt is usually the proviso of Christmas Day snacking or visits to your nan’s. But in New Zealand – a country with a penchant for on-the-fly problem-solving – the humble biscuit tin has become a mainstay of parliamentary democracy.There, as in Britain, members’ bills are a chance for MPs to have laws that they have proposed debated in the house.But unlike in Westminster, in Wellington those bills are represented by plastic bingo counters in a 30-year-old biscuit tin. A curled, yellowing paper label taped to the front helpfully proclaims: Members’ Bills.Each plastic counter represents a bill, and when there is space on parliament’s order paper for a fresh round of proposed laws, a member of the parliamentary service digs into the tin for a lucky dip.“It was what was available at the time,” Trevor Mallard, the Speaker of New Zealand’s parliament said of the tin, adding that it had initially contained “a mixed selection of biscuits”.The tin was introduced after parliamentary reforms in the 1980s that changed an earlier method for keeping track of members’ bills – a list – to a ballot draw.“This was a method of randomising and keeping the ability for relatively current issues to have their chance of being selected,” Mallard said. The list, he said, had been inefficient most bills on it were never reached.“I think 30 years ago, random number-generating computers were probably a bit rarer than they are now, and it was just a convenient thing to use,” he said.The tin came to international prominence this week when the team behind the BBC TV show QI tweeted about it.“Finally! Our sophisticated randomisation apparatus gets the international recognition it deserves,” tweeted the official New Zealand Parliament account.The official receptacle is stored in an office at New Zealand’s parliament, Mallard said. “It’s not in a place where it has enormous public access but it’s not in a safe or anything.”New Zealand is known for its socially progressive legislation, often passing bills on hotly contested issues ahead of other western countries. Some of those matters had become law only after their random selection from the biscuit tin, Mallard said.Among them were marriage equality, legalised in 2013, and assisted dying, which will go to New Zealanders for a referendum in 2020.“Governments often have a reluctance to lead on social change but often there are members who are prepared to stick their necks out and do what they think is right in this sort of area,” Mallard said. “This probably provides just a bit more opportunity for them to do it.”While the tin looks a little worse for wear, Mallard does not anticipate needing to replace it.“This was designed to keep biscuits fresh and I can’t see the … counters going off in the next hundred years,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/400002a7f94d838ec9f6d1a9e1dbee7dcc2a6da8/300_350_2564_1538/master/2564.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d8158ee306c48196046bf6a6d49b847","title":"jacques chirac remembered by francois hollande","story":"29 November 1932 – 26 September 2019The former French president was a fierce opponent who never gave up on his beliefs, says one of his successors at the Elysée• Magenta Devine remembered by Tony James• Read the Observer’s obituaries of 2019 in fullHow could I forget our first meeting? It was in June 1981, and Mitterrand had just been elected to the Elysée. I was running against Jacques Chirac in the parliamentary elections in his fief of Ussel, in the Corrèze. I was only 27 years old, and he had already been prime minister of France. I challenged him in one of his meetings, from the back of the room. He looked at me with a mixture of condescension and curiosity. We did not know that we would both have a presidential destiny.Ten years later, we were both members of parliament for the department of Corrèze. He had just lost the presidential election, having been challenged within his own party. To my great surprise, I found him at peace, convinced that his time would come again. He spoke of our home region where life was good. Even as mayor of Paris, he never failed to recall his rural roots, which played an important role in his presidential victory of May 1995.In 1997, as the first secretary of the Socialist party, I was the leader of the opposition. I didn’t spare him. During a ceremony at the Elysée, Chirac took me to one side and, almost affectionately, said quietly: “You are hard on me, but I did not spare François Mitterrand. I know what has to be done in the political battle, but I appreciate that you respect me, as I always did with my predecessor.”In 2002, I appealed for people to vote for Chirac to beat Jean-Marie Le Pen. Never before had a victory hurt him so much. He was president, but he knew that he had only been chosen by default.In January 2005, before the referendum on the European Constitutional treaty, he confided in me. “You convinced the Socialists to vote in favour. I know it was not easy for you. You should know that for the Maastricht treaty, when I supported the ‘yes’, I was booed for the first time by the party I had founded. That day, however, I knew that I would become president because I had chosen the interest of my country over that of my party.”This is a lesson that does not just apply to France.During the 12 years he led France, Jacques always had a good word for a friend, a pat on the back for an ordinary citizen, a hug for a child. I saw him more often after he left the Elysée, when I had the opportunity to discover his scholarship and curiosity for the tribal arts, Asian civilisations and Africa. He would talk of America, a country with which he had forged an affectionate bond but not one that allowed him to follow it into the war in Iraq.After 2012, he looked at political life with a combination of amusement and sadness. I saw him decline physically and slow down, he who had always been a man of action.Chirac was a fighter he could be tough with his friends, fierce with his opponents, unwavering in his convictions. What was important to him was that things should move, change rather than the direction that change took. He had faced confrontation so many times. In the storms he had held firm. He wanted to see out a destiny he had not necessarily imagined for himself, right to the end. He had dreamed of being an officer in the merchant navy before politics took hold of him. He succeeded in becoming president, at the very time when many of his friends had abandoned him. What the young hussar had not been able to conquer, the wise republican had snatched with both hands. He was less interested in power than in its conquest.Jacques sacrificed much of his personal life to devote himself to others that is the hardness and greatness of politics. I did not share his ideas or his choices, but we always agreed on what was essential: the rejection of intolerance and respect for human dignity. Jacques was like the French he embraced their contradictions and moods he was bold in speech and prudent in his actions, promising more than he could give, but not giving up on the causes that were close to his heart. He had panache. What the British think of as pride, we French consider to be character.He succeeded in being unpopular when in power and loved as soon as he gave it up, because when the statesman leaves his palace, he becomes a man once again. And in the end, it is the man who is judged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11fad7b135c811da795affd06f452afd012de01b/0_266_1312_787/master/1312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=550fafe65b33cf69351f09ebd6d4e4c6","title":"stephen cottrell appointed archbishop of york","story":"Bishop of Chelmsford will take over from John Sentamu who is retiring next yearStephen Cottrell has been named as the 98th archbishop of York, the second most senior figure in the Church of England, to replace John Sentamu who is retiring next year.Cottrell, 61, the bishop of Colchester, is well liked in the church for his down-to-earth persona. He was brought up in Essex, attended a state school and studied at the Polytechnic of Central London.He told a press conference in Church House, Westminster: “I’m a boy from a very ordinary family, from a secondary modern school in Essex, who is now called to be the archbishop of York.”Sentamu’s retirement means the loss of the C of E’s most high-profile figure from a black or minority ethnic background. In the past, Cottrell has publicly criticised the church for its shortcomings in promoting BAME clergy into senior positions.On Tuesday he said: “Our record is not good, there’s no point in pretending otherwise. This is something that matters hugely to me. I hope that when I do hang up my mitre, the church will look different and more erse.”He said he anticipated that “one day” the church would have a female archbishop of Canterbury.Cottrell said the UK was standing “on the edge of great change as we leave the European Union” and there were “many challenges ahead”.Reflecting on last week’s election results, he said: “I don’t think anyone was quite ready for the scale of Conservative victory … Boris Johnson has spoken about one nation, and that deserves our support, but the particular contribution the church can make is a global view.”He said the church had a “particular responsibility to speak for the poorest and most marginalised”, and added. “There is a north-south ide that is shockingly real.”Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said at the press conference that Cottrell was “one of the most inspiring leaders in the church. He preaches, he writes beautifully, he writes poetry, he thinks very deeply, he communicates superbly, he is not hierarchical, he’s got a huge heart that is open to the needy and poor and vulnerable, he’s a pastor.”Sentamu said Cottrell had “the gospel in his belly and a tiger in the tank.

That, she told him, was what she thought of his “superficial things!” So how to succeed in gifting where Frowick failed? Ditch the sable coat and keep it contemporary.Cult from first cuddle, the faux-fur teddy bear coat trend shows no sign of slumber, making it a failsafe festive gift for the fashion-minded. Where perfume fades and lingerie can let down, teddymania looks set to be a forever friend. While plenty of imitations have pulled up to the picnic, the mastermind brand behind this modern must-have is Max Mara, bundling the likes of Julia Roberts and January Jones in snow white and ruby red coats respectively.The teddy bear trend first stirred in 2013, when French fashion editor Carine Roitfeld made like a street-style Margot Tenenbaum wearing Max Mara’s now iconic voluminous, camel-coloured coat on the strade of Milan. Social media chorused “Ooh la la” and the visual went viral. After a short hibernation, Max Mara creative director Ian Griffiths jolted the teddy bear coat back to life in 2017, revived in a pure camel hair and silk upgrade from his alpaca and mohair original.Kim Kardashian West instantly plumped for the malt-coloured must-have and Hailey Bieber wore hers with a beanie and blue jeans. The teddy bear scooped a Best of the Best award for a women’s coat from the Robb Report China. Its prominence propelled further with posturing from social media stars including Eva Chen, director of fashion partnerships at Instagram, and Italian fashion journalist Anna Dello Russo, who both reached for red. This season, pick from corn kernel yellow, cornflower blue and turquoise too. Or for the regal ice-queen, opt for opulent white, as seen on fashion royalty Kaia Gerber, with white thigh-high boots in the AW19 show.Arguably, the teddy bear coat has become as era-defining as the 1940s fit-and-flare coats of Christian Dior’s new look, or the 1960s curved, cocoon coats of Cristóbal Balenciaga. Hard times, soft pile coat, we say, but the teddy bear coat is not the only Christmas chrysalis from which one can bloom.For an Ali MacGraw in Love Story meets Shiv Roy from Succession shrugged-a-camel-trenchcoat-over-her-shoulders-and-fair-isle-knit, Max Mara’s Manuela coat should cinch it.A perfect party dress coat, with its elegant camel wool pile and wide lapel collar, Manuela mascots range from Meghan Markle and Amy Adams to Katie Holmes and Jessica Biel. Gigi Hadid wears her Manuela coat casual with corresponding camel sweater and denim, while Elle Fanning rocks the candy pink style.A certain success story would be the gift of the 101801 Icon coat, a versatile wool and cashmere style created for Max Mara – and career women of the 1980s – by French fashion stylist Anne Marie Beretta in 1981. Double-breasted with kimono sleeves, this coat can elevate any ensemble, has never been out of production, and has been picked up from Isabella Rossellini to Claire Danes and Cate Blanchett.A Max Mara coat has become a sign of the times. A landmark moment came in February 2017, when Kenya-born Somali-American model Halima Aden wore a hijab on a Milan runway – making Max Mara one of the first mainstream fashion brands to feature a hijab-wearing model on the catwalk. It was the Max Mara AW17 show and her camel-coloured headscarf matched her Max Mara camel-hair coat. Last December, speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi’s fire-red funnel-neck Glamis coat made such waves in the White House and beyond that the fashion house chose to reissue the AW12 style.The teddy bear too has been on a bit of a journey. Griffiths, who studied under Ossie Clark at Manchester politan University and has headed up Max Mara design for more than 30 years, was first inspired by the label’s plush 1980s archive coats crafted from long-pile fabrics in fibres originally developed in German mills for making high-end childrens’ toys.Griffiths found the original mills to be closed and so worked with an Italian supplier to redevelop the technology to produce a unique faux fur of pure camel hair on a base of silk to create his teddy bear coat. Such an heirloom coat this Christmas will ultimately be loved long after the last pine needle drops. Revel in the renaissance.

Ian Griffiths, creative director of Max Mara, deftly wielded that power for the Italian brand’s AW19 collection. He started the show with a triumvirate of models dressed in matching looks, each one resplendent in their own tone-on-tone technicolour version. Cyan, cerulean and corn yellow: power, energy and passion.As the colour-clad models strode down the catwalk, even the assembled fashion industry audience felt a jolt – sitting up straighter, taking note and raising their smartphones in order to capture and share this fashion moment in real time.That bold use of colour was an adept move by Max Mara, whose collections are usually cocooned in a soft power palette of caramel, biscuit, toffee and honey shades. This one was no exception, as colour segued into cafe au lait, albeit imparted with a new dynamism by those opening looks.In turn soft and strong, dynamic and demure, Griffiths’ use of those stealth-wealth shades has helped cement Max Mara as a label for a quietly confident woman, one who wants her clothing to amplify her message, rather than speak for her. But – the designer has posited through his collections of late – does that woman not deserve a bit of vibrancy too, some future-is-bright optimism in equally good taste?That attitude is fitting for Max Mara, a brand that has a history of allowing actions to speak louder than words when it comes to celebrating women. Since 2005, the brand has collaborated with the Whitechapel Gallery to award the Max Mara Art Prize for Women to emerging female artists, while its Women in Film Max Mara Face of the Future award has been presented to Emily Blunt, Zoe Saldana and Rose Byrne among others since it was established in 2006.By casting Halima Aden for its AW17 show in February 2017, Max Mara became one of the first mainstream fashion brands to feature a hijab-wearing model on the catwalk. Considering how recent the date, it’s somewhat shocking to admit, but that was a huge leap for the fashion industry. It was just one small step, though, for a company that has had the empowerment of women at its core since it was founded in 1951.In post-war Italy, Achille Maramotti’s concept for a ready-to-wear clothing company that used industrialised processes was considered radical. This was a time when a woman’s clothes were handmade either professionally by a dressmaker if she had the means, or at home if she did not. Maramotti identified not only that the technology was there to mass produce, but that as women’s career opportunities emerged and grew, so too would their ability and confidence to dress as they wished.The fact that ready-to-wear clothing has now become the norm around the world indicates quite how tuned-in to the needs of women Maramotti was, a legacy that he passed on to his children along with a thriving family business.One factor in the brand’s success is the design 101801 Icon coat, a camel coat created in 1981 and kept in production for nearly 40 years. As sustainability shapes fashion choices as never before, and the idea of trends shifting season to season suddenly seems absurd, it’s hard to beat a relevancy rate nearing four decades.That success isn’t an anomaly though. In fact, Max Mara’s teddy bear coat, introduced in 2013, was another instant hit, and has remained a sellout with dusky pink, crimson and now a whole range of colour pop versions added to the original camel.It is this colourful approach to comforting classics that defines the future of Max Mara the marrying of established ideas with an energy that speaks to how women want to dress now. It’s especially true when you look at the over-the-top party wear that monopolises the fashion conversation elsewhere as the end of the year looms ever closer.Do the bright thing: the new Christmas style rulesWhat is it about Christmas that can so often lead one to see a stranger staring back from the mirror, adrift in a sea of sequins, or trussed up like a turkey?It’s time to say no more, to rewrite the rules of dressing for the festive season and the future beyond it. A bold pop of colour is the bright choice this holiday season – better to wake up, shake things up and allow the wearer to shine.Colour is key when it comes to gifting too, with Max Mara’s Bearing Gifts collection adding a touch of optimism to the occasion – think mittens in cyan that are impossible to misplace, the softest cerulean scarf to keep out the chill, or a bumbag in cobalt fuzz that can’t help but raise a smile. And what could be a better gift than that?To learn more about Max Mara’s bright and beautiful vision for the holiday season and beyond, visit maxmara"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"British government deciding to \u0026lsquotie itself\u0026rsquo by ruling out transition period extensionIncident referred to Garda Ombudsman Commission for examinationWhelan shot dead in vehicle before it was set on fire with his remains inside in NovemberOffice of the Inspector of Prisons an immature organisation, external report saysChristmas cribs overcrowded, with several characters arriving too early, says bishop\u0026lsquoWe believe this warrant is much stronger than the previous warrants,\u0026rsquo family sayRestructuring initiative will see the abolition of 30 senior postsSimon Harris accused of \u0026lsquobreathtaking cowardice\u0026rsquo for remarks about private practiceRyanair refuses to comment on policy as Irish Rail criticised for ban on reusablesHowever report finds death rate for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease unchangedGuinness heir synonymous with Luggala, the Wicklow estate where he held lavish partiesDeirdre Seoighe, from Rathcoole, Co Dublin, cut short maternity leave to treat victims\u0026lsquoI am convinced we are being ripped off...It makes absolutely no sense.

Those are the lucky ones and those who shop around. There are others who have been penalised by their insurers by even more than that.Glenna Gallagher from Dublin 24 assiduously shops around for car insurance every year, and keeps track of what she pays on an excel spread sheet. The cars she drives are always modest and have never cost more than €5,000. Her mileage is low. “My car insurance was at its lowest in 2008-9 and been rising ever since,” she says. In that year she paid €306.47 for a fully comprehensive policy. Her most recent policy cost her €551. “It seems very random, and it’s very hard to know what is behind the price increases. I don’t know if it’s the insurance companies who have money or if there is something like a cartel operating in places. I do know there is definitely a lack of transparency. “It’s an absolute shocker, though. I am being asked to pay more than €500 for car insurance when I don’t know if my car is even worth that any more.” Christine Mulrooney paid €220 for her comprehensive car insurance 10 years ago and last January she paid €572.89. “I’m 41 and have a full licence since I was 19. I have never made a claim, never had any penalty points. Never had a speeding fine. No accidents. I have never even been stopped by the guards.She describes it as “just mad”, and says she can find “no explanation for it”. She could have ended up paying out even more than €572.“Every year I shop around, and last year I switched provider and saved almost €200. I am convinced we are being ripped off.

File photograph: GettyThe Cabinet will on Tuesday be asked to approve an unprecedented redundancy scheme for senior gardaí that aims to remove 30 senior officers in order to pave the way for a restructuring of the force’s senior ranks. Restructuring of the Garda Síochána will see the abolition of 30 senior posts at superintendent, chief superintendent and assistant commissioner levels and the scheme will allow senior officers at these ranks to retire before the maximum retirement age of 60. They will receive six months’ salary in addition to normal pension and lump-sum entitlements. Gardaí are generally entitled to a pension of half of final salary plus a lump sum of 150 per cent final salary after 30 years of service. The scheme is expected to be rolled out quickly, with a closing date at the end of January. Departures will take effect beginning April 2020 and it is expected to cost €6.5 million next year. However it is unclear how many senior gardaí will take up the package. The plan was originally to seek 50 early retirements but a decision was taken in recent months to put forward a more modest plan. Garda sources say a small number of superintendents and chief superintendents in high-pressure posts, such as urban areas with high crime rates, are likely to eagerly take up the package. Other senior gardaí who have recently made it known they are unhappy with Garda Commissioner Drew Harris’s management style – which is more formal than his predecessors – may also be likely targets. However many of the gardaí, especially those at chief superintendent rank and above, are likely to remain on in the hope of future promotion. Sensitive timeThe initiative comes at a sensitive time for Mr Harris who is currently dealing with a backlash from chief superintendents unhappy with the fast pace of Garda reform, especially in the area of civilianisation of the force. Ministers will meet at Government Buildings for a Cabinet meeting with a packed agenda, sources say. It is understood that among the agenda items are requests for extra money for a variety of spending programmes to be included in the revised spending estimates for next year.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Central Bank has revealed insurance companies are making large profits from rising premiums while the cost of claims is falling, contradicting insurance industry claims and sparking fresh demands for Government action.The cost of motor insurance claims fell by 2.5 per cent in the last decade but premiums rose by 42 per cent, according to a Central Bank report which also revealed that insurers made an average of 9 per cent profit last year.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said he was “disappointed but not surprised” at the findings, and added that a “large part of the insurance problem is due to excessive profit-taking” by the industry.Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty described the findings as a shocking indictment of the insurance industry, and criticised the Government for peddling the misinformation campaign of the insurance industry.Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman Michael McGrath said the Government’s reform efforts were moving at “a snail’s pace”.The report, published on Monday, is the Central Bank’s first comprehensive study of premiums and cost claims and it appears to cast doubt on long-standing industry claims that the higher cost of car insurance is the result of spiralling payouts and increased claims, resulting in low profitability.It found the average cost of claims per policy fell by 2.5 per cent from €437 to €426 between 2009 and 2018 while average premiums jumped by 42 per cent from €498 to €706.DisparityThe disparity is even starker when looking at the last five years. The report found that while the average cost of claims per policy rose by 14 per cent between 2013 and 2018 average premiums rose by 62 per cent.The report also revealed that the industry here generated an average operating profit of 9 per cent last year, nearly twice the level of profitability seen in the UK.“It appears that insurers engaged in underpricing in the early part of this decade and then increased premiums beyond levels that were needed to cover losses over parts of the period, particularly between 2014 and 2017, and are now making significant profits as a result,” he said.Responding to the findings, Insurance Ireland, the umbrella group for insurers, said the 10 years of motor claims data published today shows personal injury and damage inflation is the main challenge for the sector.“The 10 years of data shows falling costs for motorists up to 2013 but the industry became loss-making and this peaked in 2014,” Insurance Ireland chief executive Gerry Hassett said.“The industry was loss-making at this time and was impacted by increasing injury and damage claims costs, lower interest rate returns and the disruptive effects of failures like Setanta Insurance,” he said.“As these trends increased from 2013 onwards, insurers had to provision for the inflation in injury and damage claims evident in the market and settlement times for claims of up to 4½ years,” Mr Hassett said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4117899.1576576697!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"proposed uk law to prevent brexit extension strange says coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLegislation proposed by British prime minister Boris Johnson to outlaw any extension of the next phase of Brexit negotiations past 2020 has been described as “strange” by Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. File Photograph: David YoungPA Wire Legislation proposed by British prime minister Boris Johnson to outlaw any extension of the next phase of Brexit negotiations past 2020 has been described as “strange” by Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. The upcoming phase of Brexit transition negotiations will focus on Britain’s future relationship with the European Union, dealing with issues such as the trade relationship, security issues and fishing rights. It was agreed Britain would remain in the EU for a transition period while these issues were worked out. The Withdrawal Agreement, the name given to the Brexit deal agreed in October, allows for an option to extend the transition period for a further two years if required. Downing Street sources recently briefed British media on plans to outlaw extending the negotiations and to fully exit the EU in 2020, as one of the Conservative Party’s first actions under the new Commons majority it commands following the UK election last week. ScepticismHowever key EU figures – including chief negotiator Michel Barnier – have expressed scepticism a deal can be agreed in time, raising the fresh prospect of a no-deal break unless there is an extension.A No 10 source said: “Last week the public voted for a government that would get Brexit done and move this country forward – and that’s exactly what we intend to do starting this week.“Our manifesto made clear that we will not extend the implementation period and the new Withdrawal Agreement Bill will legally prohibit the government agreeing to any extension.”Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Coveney described the move as a “strange decision” and one that would see the “UK deciding to tie itself in terms of options”.“Nobody is forcing the UK to apply for an extended transition period but they have the option to do it if they want to up until the middle of next summer, and what Boris Johnson is doing is essentially ruling out an option that was put into the Withdrawal Agreement for Britain,” he said. Brexit logjamThe previous Brexit logjam was resolved in October following concessions by the British side to agree to an effective border down the Irish Sea in the exit deal, a previous red line fiercely opposed by the Democratic Unionist Party. Mr Coveney said the EU will approach the next phase of talks on the future relationship to “try to move as quickly as we can,” he told reporters. “We all know that the negotiations post a British exit from the EU is going to be very complicated, it’s going to deal with multiple areas, not just a free trade agreement, it has also got to deal with security, data, fishing. There are multiple sectors which will require detailed negotiations,” he said. Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It’s that simple.   James Wallice, who is president of the university’s Conservative Society, said: “It’s disappointing to read the comments made by Dr John Jewell and Dr Andy Williams.“It’s a genuine shame to see senior lecturers at Cardiff University brand young Conservatives as “vermin” and lacking a \u0027social conscience\u0027. We are asking the University to ensure the subjects they teach are done in an impartial manner.”It is the latest in a series of cases that have come to light about the prevalence of left-wing views on university campuses in Britain.Earlier this year, a former lecturer at Lincoln University took his employer to a tribunal after he claimed that left-wing colleagues “hounded” him out.Dr Andrew Dunn was a senior lecturer in social policy at the university, but after a series of spats with fellow academics he was repeatedly disciplined and eventually dismissed from his post.His claim that he was discriminated against for his anti-PC beliefs was thrown out by the employment tribunal judge, who said this is not a protected characteristic under the equality act.A report by the Adam Smith Institute found that the number of British academics are liberal or Left-wing has been steadily on the rise since the 1960s.A survey it commissioned found that eight in ten university lecturers are “Left-wing”, as it warned of the dangers of “group think” in British institutions.Authors said the imbalance was not down to intelligence, but could be explained by “openness to experience” as “iniduals who score highly on that personality trait tend to pursue intellectually stimulating careers like academia”.The authors of the report, titled “Lackademia: Why do academics lean Left?” urge universities to tackle the issue of ideological ersity among their staff, in the same way that they seek to increase gender, class and racial ersity.Dr Williams and Dr Jewell declined to comment.  A Cardiff University spokesman said: “We are aware of the comments. These are personal comments made on personal social media accounts. They do not represent the view of Cardiff University.“We have received a number of complaints. Where a complaint relates to the behaviour of a member of Cardiff University staff, they are considered under our Dignity at Work and Study Policy.”Winter solstice 2019: Why do pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year?General election latest: Michael Gove says enshrining Brexit deal date in law won\u0026#39t lead to No Deal as \u0026#39deadlines concentrate minds\u0026#39The Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayNext Archbishop of York named as Stephen Cottrell, the current Bishop of ChelmsfordComment: Millions backed Boris Johnson\u0026#39s deal at the election.

But they are yet to find any explanation, after discovering 100 of the lights.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhatever scientists find it likely to change our understanding of space, potentially ushering in a new astrophysics, scientists said.The implications of finding such objects extend from traditional astrophysics fields to the more exotic searches for evidence of technologically advanced civilisations, the authors write in the new paper.In the research, detailed in a new paper published in the Astrophysical Journal, scientists looked at publicly available images of the sky dating as far back as the 1950s, such as old military sky catalogues. They compared those historical observations with modern sky surveys, looking for physical indicators that included stars that appear to have disappeared from the Milky Way.Finding an actually vanishing star –\u0026nbspor a star that appears out of nowhere! –\u0026nbspwould be a precious discovery and certainly would include new astrophysics beyond the one we know of today, said project leader\u0026nbspBeatriz\u0026nbspVillarroel, Stockholm University and\u0026nbspInstituto\u0026nbspde\u0026nbspAstrofísica\u0026nbspde\u0026nbspCanarias, Spain.Water is ‘common’ on alien worlds, scientists sayUsually, a dying star will change very slowly to become a white dwarf, or die with a sudden explosion as a supernova. A vanishing star would therefore indicate something else entirely: either a new, natural astrophysical phenomena or extraterrestrial activity elsewhere in the universe.The only known natural explanation for such a vanishing star would be a failed supernova, which has been theoretically predicted to be what happens when a very massive star collapses into a black hole, without sending out any kind of explosion. But those are very rare.Possible extraterrestrial explanations include lasers being sent through the universe as part of communication between stars, or Dyson spheres, which are theoretical structures that alien civilisations could build around a star and harness its energy. While both are hypothetically possible, no evidence for either has ever been discovered.Scientists have already look at 15 per cent of the possible candidate objects they have in their data, and found about 100 of the objects they called red transients. Some of them are behaving very dramatically, flaring up to become several thousands\u0026nbsptimes brighter very quickly.We are very excited about following up on the 100 red transients we have found, said\u0026nbspBeatriz\u0026nbspVillarroel\u0026nbspin a statement.They hope to launch a new\u0026nbspproject that will use citizen science and artificial intelligence to comb through the remaining 150,000 candidates that have already been identified.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wetherspoon\u0026nbsphas doubled in value since then,\u0026nbspadding more than £250m\u0026nbspto Mr Martin’s personal wealth.Earlier this week, Wetherspoon\u0026nbspalso announced plans to invest more than £200m in pubs and hotels over the next four years, creating around 10,000 jobs.New pubs and hotels will be opened, and existing pubs across the UK and Republic of Ireland will be enlarged.Most of the investment will be channelled into developments in small and medium-sized towns, but will also include larger towns and cities.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Among applicants holding five offers of places from universities, including one “conditional unconditional” offer, just 20.6 per cent chose to accept the “conditional unconditional” place, compared to 25.6 per cent in 2014.University ditches unconditional offers in bid to ‘maintain standards’‘Unconditional offers could lead to drop in top A-level grades’Unconditional offers may mean A-level students take ‘foot off the gas’Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said: “Students are considering their offers more carefully than ever, with the type of offer they receive having less of an impact than before.”She added: “Unconditional offers remain a complex issue and our new insight will further inform the dialogue, forming a crucial contribution to the current admissions practice reviews.“Their impact on attainment needs to be highlighted, though this must be seen alongside their role in widening participation activities and benefits to students’ mental health.”Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK (UUK), said: “While there are clear benefits in universities being able to use a variety of offer making practices to reflect an inidual student’s circumstances, potential and the context of their application, it is important they are used appropriately and proportionately.“An important principle of the UK system is that universities decide independently which students they accept but with this comes a responsibility to ensure that the admissions system continues to work in the best interests of students.”He added that the evidence and views of applicants towards predicted grades, unconditional offers and post-qualification admissions will be looked at as part of the admissions review by UUK.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She may look like a spinster aunt but Nixon shows us her passion, mischief and her eccentric brilliance. Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha is the definitive film about the quarter-lifeFamous for its scene of Leonardo Di Caprio being mauled by a bear, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s western is part survival drama, part revenge movie. It’s a wilderness tale on the very grandest scale. From the opening massacre to the snowbound denouement, it if full of moments that startle you with their violence and their beauty. GMShot over 12 years, Richard Linklater’s Boyhood is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. It follows main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from when he is seven years old until he is a young adult. It’s a testament to the patience and ingenuity of Linklater and to the exceptional work of his cast (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) that the film never feels phoney.

The first observations from Hubble came in October, and the new images come from November and December, offering a better look at the size and other details of the visitor.When this image was taken, the object was 326 million kilometres from Earth. Scientists can now use it and other observations to learn more about the comet.Scientists finally decide on real identity of OumuamuaHubble gives us the best measure of the size of comet Borisov\u0027s nucleus, which is the really important part of the comet, said David Jewitt, a professor of planetary science and astronomy at the University of California Los Angeles, whose team has captured the best and sharpest images of this first interstellar comet.Surprisingly, our Hubble images show that its nucleus is more than 15 times smaller than earlier investigations suggested it might be. The radius is smaller than half a kilometre. This is important because knowing the size helps us to determine the total number, and mass, of such objects in the Solar System, and in the Milky Way. Borisov is the first known interstellar comet, and we would like to know how many others there are.Scientists now expect to see other interstellar objects, and compare those with the two mysterious objects they have already been able to see.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25.

The rapid rise in streaming services in recent years has led some industry experts to warn of a new appetite for piracy.Global piracy authority Muso\u0026nbspsaid an increasingly fragmented streaming services landscape had led to content saturation among users, which has only been made worse by the launch of new platforms from Apple, Disney and BritBox\u0026nbspin 2019.Research published by Muso earlier this year revealed that UK audiences made over 5.7 billion visits to piracy sites in 2018 - a figure that will likely increase this year. The research also found that more than 80 per cent of people believed they were paying too much for content streaming.Premier League caught up in \u0027world\u0027s biggest piracy operation\u0027Expecting consumers to pay almost £100 a month for access to content may well be a challenge. So much of it is siloed off and exclusive across so many different paid-for platforms, that it\u0027s difficult for consumers to subscribe to everything they want, said Andy Chatterley, CEO of Muso.This research shows that people will inevitably seek it elsewhere via unlicensed platforms.Others believe that there is still room for growth within the streaming market and that competition will continue as new technology and platforms emerge.\u0026nbspBill Demas, CEO of streaming analytics firm Conviva, said the State of the Streaming TV Industry report in August proved the industry is nowhere near saturation point, as online viewing figures continue to increase each year.Despite extraordinary growth, streaming is still a nascent market. As the data shows, audience appetites for content are on the rise with more ways to consume than ever before, he said.It\u0027s imperative that both established players and new entrants recognise that every stream matters and take steps to address all dimensions of their streaming media business.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its stars were not formed in one continuous process, they say – but instead in a bright flash that lit up the galaxy.Our unprecedented survey of a large part of the Galactic centre has given us detailed insights into the formation process of stars in this region of the Milky Way, says\u0026nbspRainer\u0026nbspSchödel\u0026nbspfrom the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Granada, Spain, who led the observations.Contrary to what had been accepted up to now, we found that the formation of stars has not been continuous, adds Francisco\u0026nbspNogueras-Lara, who led two new studies of the Milky Way central region while at the same institute in Granada.In the study, researchers found that roughly 80 per cent of the stars in our Milky Way were formed during its earliest years, between about eight and 13.5 billion years ago. After that came about six billions years during which very few stars were born.Nasa announces first results from spacecraft sent to \u0027touch the sun\u0027But that quiet period was brought to a dramatic close with a crescendo of star formation, roughly a billion years ago, when stars with a mass of up to a few tens of million Suns formed in its centre over the course of just 100 million years.That area is now relatively quiet, birthing stars at a rate of one or two of our own Suns each year. But the new observations from the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope (VLT) allowed to look at it and peer into its path, and how it would have looked in its past.The conditions in the studied region during this burst of activity must have resembled those in \u0027starburst\u0027 galaxies, which form stars at rates of more than 100 solar masses per year, said\u0026nbspNogueras-Lara, who is now based at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, in a statement.This burst of activity, which must have resulted in the explosion of more than a hundred thousand supernovae, was probably one of the most energetic events in the whole history of the Milky Way.This newly understood period was not simply a flurry of births but of deaths, too. The massive stars that are born in a starburst live for less time than lower-mass stars, dying much sooner in spectacular supernova explosions.The new discoveries were accompanied by a spectacular picture of the Milky Way\u0027s central region, and both relied on new capabilities of the ESO\u0027s\u0026nbspmost famous telescope. New instruments allowed the researchers to look through the dust and gas that surrounds the region, and pick up new details that had never been seen before.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But they can’t make up s*** about me – and if they do, I have to take it to the courts.”Created with Sketch.Big beasts lose their seats: Prominent MPs gone in election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the Conservatives310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the ConservativesMs Flint said that Putney and Canterbury – two Labour seats in the south – were not a fair exchange for the dozens of northern seats that had been lost to Boris Johnson.The party had “gone too much towards the metropolitan cities and university towns and away from these core areas and it breaks my heart”, she warned.And she said: “I don’t believe anybody who has been the architects of our European policy in the last few years is credible to be leader.

Labour leadership hopefuls to replace Jeremy Corbyn will be laying out their policy stalls in the coming weeks and months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Most people voted for parties to the left of the Conservatives on Thursday – so with proportional representation we’d most likely have a coalition of progressive parties steering us away from austerity and a hard Brexit cliff edge,” said Clive Lewis, MP for Norwich South.“Instead, we’ve ended up with probably the most right-wing government this country has ever seen, elected a minority of voters, with devastating consequences for the most vulnerable in our society.\u0026nbsp“Most Labour members have understood this danger for some time, and it’s absurd that we as a party still haven’t backed a fair system. We need to commit 100 per cent to electoral reform at next year’s Labour conference, and we have to make sure this can never happen again.”Created with Sketch.Big beasts lose their seats: Prominent MPs gone in election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the Conservatives310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the ConservativesLabour has previously flirted with electoral reform. Going into the 2019 election the party said it would hold a constitutional convention in power that would look at the voting system – but it stopped short of explicitly mentioning proportional representation.There has historically been some resistance in the Labour movement to moving to PR, because the party has sometimes benefited from the current first-past-the-post system,\u0026nbspwinning majorities on smaller shares of the vote.In 2010 the party supported changing the voting system to the alternative vote, which is not a proportional system but allowed voters to rank candidates.But when creating the Scottish Parliament, and the Welsh and London assemblies the last Labour government used a form of PR – called the additional member system (AMS). AMS allows voters to have a local consistency MP but also for the overall result to broadly reflect the votes cast. A similar system is also used in countries such as Germany and New Zealand.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s time for Labour to recognise that First Past the Post has done nothing to create an equal society.”It comes as research by the Electoral Reform Society finds that 45 per cent of voters – or 14.5 million – did not vote for their local MP.

The pub chain owner and prominent Brexit supporter saw the value of his stake in the pub chain jump almost 10 per cent from £487m to £531m.Mr Martin had backed the Brexit Party, which failed to secure a single seat, but he will likely be pleased with the result in any case after a Tory landslide prompted Wetherspoon shares to rise from\u0026nbsp1,482p to 1,619p.Boris Johnson’s decisive win boosted the pound and sent shares in a number of UK companies soaring\u0026nbspon the hopes that uncertainty around Brexit will now fade away.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Martin has been one of the few business leaders to vocally back leaving the EU. He spent £94,856 on pro-Brexit beer mats and\u0026nbsphas regularly used the pub group’s magazine to promote the benefits of leaving.The company’s updates to the stock market have also been used as a platform to rail at EU rules and bureaucracy.Created with Sketch.General election 2019: How the night unfolded Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.227 11.28pm - First result to be announcedLabour holds Newcastle Central, albeit with a reduced majority, in the first result to be announced in the 2019 General ElectionThe Conservatives gain Blyth Valley, in the North East, from Labour in the first big upset of the night.

Wetherspoon\u0026nbsphas doubled in value since then,\u0026nbspadding more than £250m\u0026nbspto Mr Martin’s personal wealth.Earlier this week, Wetherspoon\u0026nbspalso announced plans to invest more than £200m in pubs and hotels over the next four years, creating around 10,000 jobs.New pubs and hotels will be opened, and existing pubs across the UK and Republic of Ireland will be enlarged.Most of the investment will be channelled into developments in small and medium-sized towns, but will also include larger towns and cities.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.Today poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education and no better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania.

She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.There are 258 million children and young people around the world with no access to education\u0026nbsp– 59 million at the primary level alone, according to Unesco’s Institute for Statistics.Today, poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education programmes. No better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania, where a 12-year-old boy, out of school, forced\u0026nbspinto a life of work, trapped in a dead-end cycle of danger and despair so he can provide for his family, provides perspective. He says: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my brothers and sisters. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.”Chacha works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, on one of the many small-scale gold mining sites in the northwest of the country. Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold. Chacha’s cut of £1.50 a day is used to contribute to household bills. The work is exhausting and dangerous. Trespassers are shot on sight – even children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTanzania\u0026nbsphas strong laws governing child labour,\u0026nbspreinforced by the national action plan to eliminate the practice. The plan prohibits under-18s from engaging in hazardous work, including mining, but children are still lured into mines with the hope of changing their fortunes and those of their families.Chacha has never set foot in a classroom, perhaps he never will. He is one of the estimated 1.895 million children out-of-school children\u0026nbspin Tanzania today.New hope for Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge’s brutal war on educationHis only possible salvation may come through partnerships such as those between the Education Above All\u0026nbspFoundation (EAA) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT). These collaborations place a strong emphasis on capacity building – boosting schools in all areas to help them run efficiently and sustainably – as well as community engagement and service support. The EAA-GMT partnership has successfully enrolled 23,479 out-of-school children\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquality primary education over\u0026nbsptwo years in the Mara region – comprising the most challenging and hardest to reach districts of Tanzania.GMT brought in the Complementary Basic Education in Tanzania (COBET) accelerated learning programme, to give a second chance to over-age learners who had never been to school – and to those who had dropped out.In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme\u0026nbspand eliminated public school fees\u0026nbspto increase access to primary education. But\u0026nbspmany challenges have arisen. Schooling is now mandatory for children aged seven to 15, and although enrolment has dramatically increased, Tanzania has not yet achieved universal primary education. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary\u0026nbspparental contributions required for enrolment. This includes, among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.All children should be able to attend primary school regardless of whether their parents can or can’t afford to pay or see the value, perhaps never having received\u0026nbspan education themselves. At its core, if a child fails to gain the basic skills required to contribute as a functioning member of\u0026nbspsociety, the loss is vast, not just to the child or society but the nation as a whole. For those sceptical, education can ultimately reduce poverty for future generations. Studies show the cost of educating children is far outweighed by the cost of not educating them.Their schools lie in ruins – but is there hope for Mosul’s children?Women of Gaza: Empowered and resilientThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolSheikha Moza bint Nasser, chair\u0026nbspand founder of EAA, has dedicated much of her life to ensuring the most marginalised children can go to school, when there was no duty or expectation for her to do so. At\u0026nbspUnesco’s headquarters in Paris last year, she said: “Statistics cannot catalogue the impact of\u0026nbspchildren’s broken dreams. So we must not allow ourselves to be ‘numbed’\u0026nbspby the numbers, and we cannot accept apathy as a response. Because history, as we know, will judge us, by both what we do, and what we choose not to do.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He made sure lines of communication were kept open and regularly hopped on his motorbike and visited his grandparents and other members of his extended family.I suspect that being caught up in this nightmare, which has seen them appear on network TV both here and in the US, as well as an utterly surreal meeting with Donald Trump at the White House, has made it almost impossible for Harry’s parents to grieve properly for their son.They are still in shock, dazed and barely sleeping, and it is only their resolve to achieve justice for their son that is driving them on. Harry’s death made global headlines.Sadly, the spotlight shts all too quickly, and the world forgets about such tragedies and moves on. But Charlotte, Tim and Niall, and everyone who knew and loved Harry, lives with the pain every single minute of every single day.Charlotte told me that Niall, always the quieter and less out-going twin, is finding it extremely hard to come to terms with the death of his brother.He cannot bear to talk about what happened and is haunted because he doesn’t know exactly how Harry died.Tim has spoken about seeing his son’s poor shattered bloody body at the crash scene and how he tried to reassure him that all would be well, but his boy died shortly afterwards.Frankly, I don’t know how Anne Sacoolas can live with herself.If she had only stayed to help the police piece together what had happened, she would have had the chance to express her sorrow, and more than likely been given a suspended sentence.That would at least have given Harry’s family some peace of mind.Instead, Charlotte and Tim are trying to get US officials to listen to them and hoping Donald Trump will make good on his promise of getting something done.If the President thought he could steamroller this “ordinary” British couple during that encounter, he was soon put right.They turned down his clumsy attempt at setting up a meeting with Sacoolas, who was waiting in a White House side room. They didn’t want to be bounced into a Trump photo opportunity, and they also said they rejected an offer of compensation.Charlotte and Tim are also ready to file a civil lawsuit against Sacoolas in the state of Virginia, in an attempt to have her hand herself in to UK authorities.I spoke to them about how the family would face Christmas, and they simply shook their heads in sorrow. Fighting tears, Charlotte told me it was going to be horrendous, especially as Harry loved this time of year so much.I can’t get out of my head the image of them at home, surrounded by sadness, while neighbours in houses around them are making merry.Charlotte said it was made worse by the fact that Sacoolas will be able to celebrate Christmas with her children.It seems the Sacoolas family and the authorities are hoping thatthey stall long enough Charlotte and Tim are just going to go away.I can assure them that they will never give up.I sincerely hope this courageous couple, who are going through the torments of hell, somehow manage to shame officials here and in the US into doing what’s right.Sacoolas should be sent back to the UK to explain herself, apologise and face her punishment.New PM Boris Johnson has a bloody long to-do list, but justice for Harry must be one of his priorities.WILL he fall at the final hurdle Saturday night or will Anton du Beke go all the way and win his first ever Strictly Glitterball after  years of trying.If I was ever to do the showthen you can bet your le it would be poor old Anton who would have to shove me around the dancefloor like an overstuffed wardrobe.He tends to get the plucky no-hopers of a certain age, but this year was given a real contender in the shape of firecracker Emma Barton, from EastEnders.It’s too close to call with the other two finalists, Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden, and Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse at the top of their game, but no one would begrudge Anton his moment of glory.JENNIFER Lopez celebrated her Screen Actors Guild Award nomination with an online message to her fans – while on a treadmill in the gym.Being J-Lo, her make-up was flawless, she was wearing a gorgeous tracksuit and she completed the look with fabulous hoop earrings.Despite working out, she wasn’t even glowing, never mind perspiring.What a contrast to the rest of us.I’m a sweaty, red-faced mess after my exercise class and look as though I’ve been dragged through every hedge in the land not just backwards, but forwards too.J-Lo has been nominated for a SAG for her role as Ramona in Hustlers, and during the message she even got a little teary, but of course without the red nose and puffy eyes of us mere mortals.She makes the world a more beautul place.She’s the powerhouse behind the insane Kardashian phenomenon and expert at making very little talent go a bloody long way. Now we are told that the scariest stepmother since Cinderella’s has decided to buy her long-suffering family, including her -year-old mum, Botox vouchers for Christmas.Obviously there’s a money-making opportunity here, as Kris has signed up to promote a Botox company offering  gt tokens as seasonal presents.And I suppose eventhey are insulted or unhappy about her gt, they won’t be able to show those emotions on their newly frozen faces.So Kris wins again.I’M deeply concerned and extremely angry about the current mumps epidemic among hundreds of university students.Since this summer, more than , cases of this dangerous and infectious disease have been reported. If untreated it can lead to deafness, meningitis, and can reduce male fertility.It’s a direct result of parents refusing to let their kids be given the MMR jab when the recent crop of sufferers were babies at the turn of the century.Scare stories about MMR being linked with autism led to parents opting out of immunisation and now we are reaping the whirlwind.Health officials have urged anyone who hasn’t had the jab to do so immediately and have warned of a “public health time bomb”.There’s also been a surge in the cases of measles, a disease that can kill.It is outrageous that we are fortunate enough to have the science to eradicate these diseases completely, and save millions of lives in the process, but through misinformation, stubbornness and, even in a few cases sheer laziness, measles and mumps are being allowed to flourish once more.We need to get a grip and protect our babies, children and young people from harm that is easily preventable.WELL done to Great British Bake Off runner-up Steph Blackwell for being so refreshingly honest about her struggles with ious eating disorders.The -year-old, who was a joy to watch on the show, wants to help other people struggling with anorexia, bulimia and depression and to reassure them that things can get better.When she was , and in the grip of the illness, she would never have imagined one day she would be enjoying baking in front of the nation.Steph is proof that debilitating and often le-threatening eating disorders can be brought under control with understanding and the right kind of help.More power to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is now vital, economically and politically, the Tories pump money into those regions and transform them.The gap between them and London has been too wide too long.And our re-elected PM was dead right to make that his priority in his first speech at No since winning his thumping majority.We must “unite and level up”, he said. Exactly.Remainers may take a while to “unite”, to “heal”. But the levelling-up can start now, by spending on infrastructure, including big transport improvements.That, admittedly, takes years. In the short-term, low-tax zones and other tax breaks can revive High Streets and lure job-creating firms out of big cities and into regions which need the boost.More money for public services is key too. The NHS, social care and crime are priorities across the country. So are many more affordable homes.Visible improvements can be made rapidly, such as with a new determination to end rough sleeping, as the Blair Government almost did.For years The Sun backed the Tories as they cut spending to fix the chaos Labour left in .That work is largely done — and, let’s face it, public patience for penny-pinching is at an end.We will trust a Tory Chancellor infinitely more than a Marxist one to spend prudently without bankrupting us.Equally exciting is the power Boris now has both to reinvent the civil service to deliver on national priorities and to reshape our politics.The Tories have a golden chance to rebrand and recast themselves as the party of working people, of Sun readers — and end the lefties’ tired mantra that they serve only the rich.It is also time to fix the anti-Tory bias in our election system.It is incredible their big win came even despite constituency boundaries favouring Labour. These must be redrawn.Two years ago we said Britain needed a strong Tory majority to improve lives and take big decisions to reform public services. It has finally come true.We heartily congratulate the many new Tory MPs. Chiefly, though, we congratulate three men.One is Isaac Levido, the party’s talented and driven Aussie elections guru.The other two, Dominic Cummings and Boris himself, have genuinely made history twice, against staggering odds.They took on the Remainer establishment and won the Brexit vote in . Now they have crushed the Remainers’ long refusal to deliver on it.In one momentous instant, as the exit poll dropped at pm on Thursday, these men ended three and a half years of ­political purgatory and paralysis.All the trickery and plots of duplicitous Remainer MPs and their rogue Speaker Bercow to reverse the referendum came to nothing.All the expensive legal cases, the collusion with EU officials, the long PR campaign of hatred towards Leavers and Boris . . . all were for nothing.In that one moment Boris won his mandate, Brexit was secured and the “People’s Vote” charade destroyed.Corbynism — which had terried millions, not least Britain’s Jews — was instantly over too and the nation liberated from the shadow of hard-left extremism.Then one Brexit-blocking MP after another was dumped by voters.Cummings’s and Boris’s achievements cannot be overstated. They are victories on a dferent scale even from Tony Blair’s against an exhausted Tory Party.As for what remains of Blair’s party we say this: It is staggering to see Corbyn cling on, plainly hoping to stitch up the leadership for some hard-left successor.That will just guarantee ­perpetual irrelevance.He, McDonnell, Seumas Milne, their Momentum social justice warriors and their repugnant media foghorns must be driven out NOW.With a few honourable exceptions, Labour’s “moderate” MPs and voters have shown a repugnant lack of spine by failing to do so already.Indeed the hypocrisy of politicians like Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy has never been plainer, begging Britain to hand power to Corbyn and his anti-Semitic, terrorist-supporting mob, then denouncing them the instant they lost.These unprincipled charlatans backed a Marxist manesto, only to turn on it once voters recoiled. Shame on them. It may be too late anyway. Labour looks irredeemably in the grip of hard-left cranks. Do Phillips and Wes Streeting really need five more years of this  We look forward to a bloodletting like this once-great party has never seen.“Change is coming”, Corbynistas used to say, with no little menace.It sure is.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Wrong.There are simply not that many avocado-munching Marxists in the country, comrade.Labour has spent years calling the .million people who voted to leave the European Union stupid, ­racist, pig-ignorant peasants.This is just in — calling people stupid is not a vote-winner.And now, this sorry excuse for a Labour Party has been given the apocalyptic kicking it so richly deserved.Under the extremist stewardship of Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and the brain-dead thugs of Momentum, Labour happily abandoned the working class. And now the working class has abandoned Labour. My guess — for ever.The North is blue. The Red Wall has fallen. Great Grimsby. Scunthorpe. Even Bolsover — home of Dennis Skinner, the erstwhile “Beast of Bolsover” — is Tory today.And Stoke-on-Trent, Wolverhampton North East and Sedgefield — Tony Blair’s safe Labour seat for so many years — are sending Conservative MPs to Westminster.The great mystery is how Labour ever deluded itself that this country could embrace a party leader who has licked the grimy toenails of Hamas, Hezbollah, the IRA and indeed, it seems, any Brit-hating terrorist that would cheerfully do a jig on all our graves.This country will never elect a leader who openly despises the nation he seeks to represent. Why would we Labour — this jaw-droppingly out-of-touch Labour Party, this North London protest group masquerading as a serious political party — forgot why it was founded more than a century ago.And no, it wasn’t to represent a bunch of privately educated revolutionaries in Islington. It was to stand up for the working man and woman.Labour spat on the very people it was meant to represent. And now watch Labour choking on its own spit.Brexit — and the endless sneering at Brexit, and the thwarting of Brexit, and the endless attempts to abort Brexit — was just the start of Labour’s spectacular fall.Corbyn’s Labour never understood the working class.Hear this, comrade — the working class do not want handouts. They are not victims. They can’t be bought with glass beads, shiny trinkets and promises of free broadband.And they do not think they should apologise for being British and for loving this country and its history.All across our nation, working-class communities decided that the Conservatives were the true party of the working class.And let’s be honest, those Labour-voting heartlands have always had plenty of reasons to NOT vote Tory.Although Boris’s spectacular victory is being compared to Mrs Thatcher’s glory years, Maggie was always heartily despised in the regions where they built ships and mined for coal and did jobs where you got your hands dirty.For when these hard-working communities were tossed on the scrapheap of changing times, there seemed scant sympathy or understanding in Maggie Thatcher’s Conservative Party about the human cost of deindustrialisation.Analysis by the Financial Times shows that the more low-paid, low-skilled workers living in a constituency, the better the Tories did.Think about it — the Tories are the party fighting for struggling families now.And their victory is so complete that the leaders of the two opposition parties, Jo Swinson and Jeremy Corbyn, have either resigned or are about to resign.These men and women in those post-industrial communities saw their families suffer dreadfully when the old industries died.They were never going to vote for Jeremy Corbyn and his Communist clowns.But getting them to actually break the habit of a letime and vote Tory signals an historic change in our politics.After this week, the old tribal party loyalties have gone for ever.It no longer matters a damn how your parents and your grandparents voted.Boris Johnson has been swept to power by millions who never voted Tory in their lives. Now he has to keep them.And he has to show he is a Prime Minister who understands that there is a country beyond the M.Brexit is just the start.The Prime Minister’s in-tray is piled high with the housing crisis, rising crime and communities across our nation that feel totally forgotten by Westminster. Brexit should have been done and dusted years ago.And the only reason it is not is because the establishment cynically thwarted the result of the  EU referendum.But all the yakking about revoking Article , and a second referendum, and arcane Parliamentary procedures, and cobblers about a “People’s Vote” is suddenly in the past.If Remainers want us to be members of the EU then they must now be prepared to campaign for decades.The Brexit debate is over and Boris Johnson has a mandate to reshape our country as a global nation that is open to trade with the world.Frankly, Boris’s election campaign was uninspired.Boris beat Corbyn the way that boxer Anthony Joshua beat roly-poly Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabi — safety first, nothing fancy, just stay on the end of your jab and, above all, WIN. Because the consequences of losing were just too bloody awful to contemplate.Butthe campaign was uninspiring, Boris remains an inspirational politician.People like him. He gives them optimism and hope. He puts a smile on faces.His enemies paint him as a racist, right-wing bigot but the man is exactly the opposite.Boris is a tolerant, big-hearted, one-nation Tory with a razor-sharp mind and an endlessly generous spirit.The newspaper article that is always cited as evidence of his racism — the one where he compared women in full-body burkas to a letter box — was actually advocating their right to dress any way they choose, no matter how ridiculous it looks.There is no hatred in Boris Johnson. There is no poison. And God knows there has been a poisonous atmosphere in our politics for years.I live in an inner-city, safe Labour seat, and usually there would be the leaflets of three or four parties represented in the windows of our neighbourhood.But there were no leaflets in windows at this election. Because there is too much hatred abroad, too much toxic ision, too many idiots willing to stick a brick through the window of someone who dares to disagree with them.Whatever our beliefs, the great hope now must be that we can start coming together as a country, and begin to heal, and start building some kind of national unity.A Tory Prime Minister elected by the working class seems a good place to start.My parents — a Labour-voting mum and a Liberal-voting dad — despised the Tories as the party of the rich, the privileged, the out-of-touch toffs.That sentiment has been shared by millions of ­working-class men and women since the end of World War Two. Until now.From the Black Country to Blyth Valley, we are all Tories now.It is ironic that it took an Old Etonian Oxford graduateto make the Tories the natural party of the working class.And now Prime Minister Johnson and his new Tories must prove they are worthy of all those working-class votes.And let us hope that the Labour Party can find its soul again.Let us hope that this formerly great party of compassion, social justice and equality can kick out all the bigots, middle-class Reds, IRA groupies, friends of Hamas and Hezbollah and the anti-Semites who would rather wave the Palestinian flag than the Union Jack.But it is likely that ­Labour has already been dumped in the recycling bin of history.Because this doesn’t feel like a defeat for the Labour Party. It feels more like a death.It is hard to see how Labour can crawl out from under this landslide.These last years have not really been about party politics. They have been about the will of the people coming into direct conflict with the will of the establishment.The combined forces of the House of Commons and House of Lords, the BBC and Channel , the Supreme Court and expensive lawyers, RADA revolutionaries like Hugh Grant, Steve Coogan and Emma Thompson, all placed themselves above people.All of the political paralysis, and the national humiliation of never getting Brexit done, and the endless frustration of seeing democracy being cheated stems from an arrogant establishment that refused to accept the largest vote for anything in our history.What a shameful, anti-democratic place this country would bethey had won. But they lost. Now let us move forward at last.Millions of working-class men and women just placed their faith in a decent, ­brilliant, chubby-cheeked, shaggy-haired, dog-loving toff to deliver a better tomorrow for ALL of our people.As unlikely as it seems, you are a working-class hero now, Boris.Andyou make your supporters proud to be working-class Tories, then you, Carrie and your dog Dilyn will be in No for the next ten years. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there was a moment when I knew we’d absolutely had it.The BBC’s Nick Robinson was questioning Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell. “The Conservative message, ‘Get Brexit Done’, is very clear. What’s yours ”There was an audible gulp from Mr McDonnell, a pause, followed by patter so inconsequential that I now can’t recall it word for word. And that’s the point. If you are asking people to lend you the most precious thing they have in a democracy — their vote — you have to be able to say why.On Brexit, was Labour’s leader Jeremy Corbyn in favour of leaving the EU with his “sensible deal”, or of staying in it  He didn’t seem to know — orhe did he was keeping it from the electorate.There has not been a more abject failure of leadership by the head of any British political party since the war.Mr Corbyn, Mr McDonnell and their puppet-master, Len McCluskey, now blame not themselves but Brexit for Labour’s night of shame. But our Brexit dficulties were largely brought about by Mr Corbyn. They started with the  EU referendum.For most of that campaign, he was invisible. Only reluctantly was he persuaded to say something. When he did, it was without enthusiasm.There’s a reason for Mr Corbyn’s indecision on Brexit. The Jeremy Corbyn I knew in  years in the Commons was the man who voted against every EU treaty change — and left the strong impression he couldn’t stand the institution. But scared to fight for it, he put his party into the worst position, of having no position at all.But Brexit was just a symptom of Labour’s problems. Their cause was Mr Corbyn, what he stood for. He and those who have propped him up can body-swerve as much as they want.They have to face up to this unpalatable truth. Mr Corbyn was convincedthat the more left-wing Labour’s manesto, the more votes we would get.He didn’t disappoint. It was even more left-wing that our last effort like that — Labour’s  manesto, tagged “the longest suicide note in history”.I back far greater public spending than are the Conservatives. It’s one reason why I have been in Labour for  years.I want a fairer society, with greater equality, better opportunities and no discrimination. But you have to take people with you on this journey, and remember that it’s their money that will be paying for it.Mr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn forgot this. They tried to promise everything at once, in a single incontinent splurge. The result was inevitable. The party fell flat on its face.Last was the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism Mr Corbyn allowed to gain hold in the party until it was too late. We were indelibly stained.After Labour’s  election defeat, Neil Kinnock did the honourable thing and announced he was going.He didn’t hang around in a transparent attempt to organise the election of a successor, which is what it appears Mr Corbyn is doing — asmore of the same toxic mixture is going to work. It can’t.I love the Labour Party and all the decent things it stands for, and has done for our society. We can have a future, but onlywe break with the dismal Corbyn agenda and have a leader and organisation that can take us on that long journey.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His disastrous leadership was cited as the most popular reason for not voting Labour, followed by HIS nonsensical Brexit policy, then HIS barmy plans for the economy.He and his crackpot advisers are entirely to blame for Labour’s worst electoral performance in  years.Sadly for millions of decent Labour voters, that’s not how Corbynistas see it.As Emily Thornberry has apparently made clear, in their eyes the electorate was too uneducated and bigoted to grasp the wonders of “real change”.Well, we’ve got news for the Marxist clowns.It doesn’t take a fancy degree from a top university to know an IRA-supporting, Britain-hating anti-Semite when you see one.Or to understand that a politician who promises endless freebies is clueless about economics.Corbyn and his comrades have proved that they simply don’t get this country.They must quietly slip into obscurity.THE SUN is delighted that Boris Johnson plans to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee.When we all depended on the Beeb for entertainment, forcing viewers to cough up was just about defensible.But in , when many Brits are getting their dramas from Netflix and their sport from Sky, it emphatically is not.It’s downright shocking that good citizens from poor households are getting criminal records for such a trivial non-offence. And ludicrous that courts are wasting precious time prosecuting them.The pompous and patronising BBC is losing relevance by the day.A system that locks up those who don’t pump their hard-earned cash into its bloated coffers is clearly broken.BORIS Johnson has hit the nail on the head: rotten Whitehall is ripe for reform.In almost any other line of work,you do a bad job, you’re out on your ear.But because it’s practically impossible to sack civil servants, hundreds of sub-par paper-pushers are retiring with a £,-a-year pension — an eye-popping  per cent higher than the national average.The four core values of the civil service are honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity — all noble principles that have been unceremoniously cast aside by the scaremongering Remoaners currently roaming Whitehall.The Prime Minister’s bold plan to give them the chop is an excellent sign that this Government means business. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last week, nearly eight in ten backed Boris Johnson. Just  per cent of Workington Men voted for Jeremy Corbyn, and nine in ten believed Boris would make a better Prime Minister.In backing Boris and Brexit, these voters have made the Conservative Party far more representative of working Britain. More than a third of Conservative voters are now manual or skilled workers, and more than two thirds did not go to university.Geographically, the Tories now hold three times as many seats in the North East as they did historically, as well as three quarters of constituencies in the West Midlands, up from just one in four in . So much for the party of the South, the rich and the privileged.But this new electoral coalition will demand a new kind of politics. The common ground of public opinion is now marginally to the left on the economy and right on culture.By a ratio of two to one, voters want a society focused on giving people more security rather than freedom, and investment in public services rather than income tax cuts.If Boris wants to keep Workington Man blue he must break free of the traditional conservative economic playbook of trickle-down growth and bring purpose back to towns in the North and Midlands.It is telling that the walls of Workington train station are adorned with posters of the local British Steel factory that closed in , after  years of continuous production. This is a town proud of its history.The Conservatives must help Workington identy its economic future.New infrastructure, including better roads, reliable trains and faster broadband, will help. But on their own they will not be enough. For towns such as these to flourish, they need skilled jobs, dynamic companies and lasting private-sector investment.Margaret Thatcher bent over backwards to bring Nissan to Sunderland, revitalising the region and jump-starting a lagging national industry.Boris Johnson should do the same, using science, research  development and skills spending to tempt world-class companies in emerging sectors such as renewable energy and advanced manufacturing to cluster in his party’s new heartlands.High-skill jobs need skilled workers to do them — making a retraining revolution essential.More than a third of Workington Man voters have an apprenticeship and another third are educated to GCSE level. They are highly vulnerable to automation and globalisation.The Conservative manesto included £million a year to retrain disadvantaged people, but Onward’s analysis suggests more than £billion is needed each year to retrain Britain’s .million low-skilled workers before automation hits.The Tories must also reflect on the social fabric of the places it now represents.In many regional towns, the high street is emptying, libraries, pubs and social clubs are closing and crime is a rising concern.Places such as Wrexham, Blyth Valley and Bishop Auckland, all of which voted Conservative for the first time last week, are not in the lowest ranks of deprivation but they are united by a shared loss of belonging. The Conservatives need an answer to this fraying public realm.There is a limit to how much Whitehall can ever repair a sense of community itself, so a good start would be putting people and places back in control.The success of city mayors shows the value of local accountability for local services — as Boris Johnson, a former Mayor of London, knows well.Every place should be able to take the local leadership that the capital enjoyed during his tenure.Local groups should be given powers to take over shops, post offices and pubs when they close, with funding to match. More people should be encouraged to live and work near to where they grow up, rather than moving to the city to make their way.For too long, social success has been defined by how far you move from your parents.The realignment witnessed last week was profound, but it is not yet permanent.More than a fth of voters engaged in contract voting, lending their support to a party other than the one that represents their values — and contract voting was strongest in Leave seats and former Labour strongholds that fell to the Conservatives.Workington Man lent his vote. To make him vote blue again, the Tories need to deliver. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More than  fresh-faced new Tories are among those coming to Parliament for the first time thanks to Boris Johnsonaposs resounding victory. Many have long and storied careers ahead of them. But some of them have a few skeletons in their past too. Weaposve looked at some of the new MPs who landed themselves in controversy before they even arrived in their new offices in Westminster. Brendan Clarke-SmithThe Tory who ousted Labour in Bassetlaw told a hustings food banks were being used too often as a top up and a political weapon.Explaining the huge rise in foodbanks he said: If you keep saying to people that you’re going to give stuff away, then you’re going to have an increase I’m afraid. He said food banks should only be a short-term solution and it was simply not true that Britain is some kind of country in crisis and in absolute poverty. He later told the Mirror the reaction to his comments was staged outrage. He added: I stand by the fact itaposs been weaponised. I donapost obviously believe that everybody who uses a food bank is just taking advantage, I think thataposs actually very rare. Ian LevyThe Tory who took Blyth Valley, Labour since , was accused of misleading the public after a Facebook post that described him as an NHS nurse was quietly edited.The post dated November  originally said: As an NHS nurse myself, I am immensely proud of the investment by our Conservative government. This post was edited  days later to describe him as an NHS mental health nursing assistant.  A local NHS worker told the Mirror that despite sounding similar, the two roles were very dferent and colleagues were angry that he would lie about being a nurse to win votes. Mr Levy did notrequests for comment. Karl McCartney The MP who seized Lincoln back from Labour apologised during the campaign for retweeting a post claiming Tommy Robinson had been imprisoned for aposreporting on Muslim paedophilesapos. Mr McCartney also shared a letter from Tommy Robinson with his followers in which the extreme right-winger claimed his murder by Islamic prison gangs would spark a revolution It read: “I’ve always said I’d sacrice my le tomorrowit would end the Islamic takeover of our beautul land.”  Nick Lowles, chief executive of HOPE not Hate, said the activity showed he was utterly unfit to be an MP. In a statement, Mr McCartney said: I apologise unreservedly. In no way do I endorse the tweets or the accounts behind them. I accept retweeting them was ill judged and could cause offence. This isive figure [Mr Robinson] has no place in our politics or public le. Anthony BrowneAnthony Browne, an ex-aide to Boris Johnson , blamed migrants for bringing germs to UK and for the spread of HIV. Labour called on Tories to boot out Mr Browne after the articles were unearthed by.Writing for the Spectator, he said: “It is not through letting in terrorists that the governmentaposs policy of mass migration – especially from the third world – will claim the most lives. It is through letting in too many germs.” Mr Browne, who worked for the PM when he was Mayor of London, has apologised for the comments in the past.  Speaking when appointed Mr Johnsonaposs policy chief at City Hall he said: “I do very much regret any offence caused by any past newspaper articles. It really never was my intention to cause offence but to provoke debate. The articles, which I deeply regret writing, also don’t give a fair reflection of my views. I want to make clear that I am emphatically not anti-immigration.” During the campaign, a Conservative party spokesperson said: “These comments were made over  years ago, Anthony Browne has apologised for these comments and sincerely regrets them.” Lee Anderson Tory Lee Anderson said nuisance council house tenants should live in tents and work in fields In a shocking video rant on Facebook, the Tory MP for Ashfield said he thinks they should be plucked from their homes and made to pick potatoes for  hours a day. During the campaign, he was caught getting his friend to act as a aposswing voterapos in another disinformation scandal to hit the Conservative party.  In the video posted during the campaign, he said: These people who have to live somewhere, letaposs have them in a tent, in the middle of a field. Six oaposclock every morning, letaposs have them up, letaposs have them in the field, picking potatoes or any other seasonal vegetables, back in the tent, cold shower, lights out, six oaposclock, same again the next day. That would be my solution. Mr Anderson took the constituency of Ashfield in Nottinghamshire from Labour with , votes. Sally-Ann Hart Sally-Ann Hart sparked outrage when she appeared to suggest people with learning dficulties could work for less than the minimum wage. Ms Hartaposs opinion, which comes from a piece she wrote for the Spectator in , was branded outdated and inexcusable by disability campaigners, The Tory, who replaced Amber Rudd Hastings and Rye, is also facing two-party investigations over alleged Islamophobia and anti-Semitism - but Prime Minister Boris Johnson opted not to suspend her.

Itaposs understood the Shadow Education Secretary is preparing a bid to become Labouraposs deputy leader - not the top job. That would allow her flatmate, shadow business secretary and left-wingersapos favourite Ms Long-Bailey, a clearer run to move for the crown. It comes as Mr Corbyn indicated he would quit as Labour leader in the early part of next year after the party suffered its worst General Election defeat since . Tom Watson stepped down as deputy leader shortly before the election was called. The Mirror understands Ashton-under-Lyne MP Ms Rayner has not made a final decision, but is exploring a deputy leadership bid. In a tweet on Monday evening , Ms Rayner said she will work day and night to restore the party to its rightful place. Ms Long-Bailey, who is the MP for Salford, is one of several candidates said to be a possible successor to Mr Corbyn, having received the backing of senior figures in the partyaposs current leadership. It is understood Mr Corbyn will address his much diminished parliamentary Labour party in Westminster on Tuesday, where he will likely face disgruntled MPs. The Labour leadership battle descended into acrimony on Sunday after another contender, Emily Thornberry, was accused by former MP Caroline Flint of labelling Leave voters stupid following the European referendum result in .  Shadow foreign secretary Ms Thornberry accused Ms Flint, who lost her Don Valley seat in the election, of spreading the most extraordinary lies and confirmed she had approached her solicitors over the remarks. Ms Flint accused Ms Thornberry of telling a colleague after the  referendum, Iaposm glad my constituents arenapost as stupid as yours and said the comments were not acceptable. The Islington South and Finsbury MP, speaking on Sky News on Monday, said she had asked Ms Flint to rescind the comment before she started legal action.  One of my former colleagues came out and said the most extraordinary lies about me, Ms Thornberry, who is also considered a candidate in the Labour leadership race, said. Iaposve contacted her and Iaposve said to her, aposPlease withdraw, I will give you until the end of the dayapos and she hasnapost. So Iaposve had to go to solicitors. I mean, people can slag me off - so long as it is true, Iaposll take it on the chin.

The leader is expected to be bombarded with questions from backbenchers in the Commons after their worst election result since . Mr Corbyn, who will quit early next year, has been heavily criticised since the election. Party leadership hopefuls including favourite Rebecca Long- Bailey, Lisa Nandy, Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner were among mourners at the funeral of party grandee Frank Dobson today. Meanwhile, a close ally of Mr Corbyn has blamed the BBC for fuelling Labour ’s crushing defeat. Shadow Transport Secretary, Andy McDonald, launched a furious broadside at the broadcaster, accusing it of playing a role in Labour’s hammering. In a tense exchange with Radio  Today programme host Justin Webb, the frontbencher said: “I’m worried about our public service broadcaster.” Webb asked: “Are you saying that the BBC was in part responsible for Mr Corbyn’s loss ” Mr McDonald replied: “I am saying that they played a part. I’m going to look at us. We’re the important part here, we got this wrong. “Butthe BBC are going to hold themselves out as somehow having conducted themselves in an impartial manner, I think they’ve really got to have a look in the mirror.” London Mayor Sadiq Khan appeared to rule himself out of the leadership race by concentrating on winning a second term in the capital. He encouraged the next leader to be reflective about last week’s defeat at the polls, saying: “I don’t believe in heroic failure, we don’t improve anybody’s lives by losing elections.” Labour’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, has reportedly recommended the contest starts on January , with the view of having a new leader in place by the end of March.

The Most Rev Justin Welby shared his Christmas message with The Big Issue yesterday, in which he reflected on the state of vulnerable people in the country, which he said has become worse over the last nine years. The archbishop was also asked about the Duke of York scandal, and his thoughts on whether the royal family have to adhere to a higher moral code than the rest of society. I think generally speaking they do serve in a way that is extraordinary in what is literally, for them, a le sentence, he said. I think to ask that they be superhuman saints is not what we should do because nobody is like that. Everybody makes mistakes, everybody is human. I am not commenting on any member of the royal family except to say that I am astonished at what a gt they are to this country.

Devoted mum-of-three Gemma Turner vowed to get him an arm when he came home from school crying one day, saying he was fed up having to struggle. Amazingly, he got his new green superhero arm six days ago and has been wearing it ever since. Most prosthetics for children are created for below the elbow - yet Jacob, who was born premature, was born with just a tiny bit of his left arm after a scan at  weeks showed it was missing. This means any creation is more problematic as it is harder to get the  limb to stay attached and an elbow joint has to be created. Doubled with the fact that robot prosthetics are generally not available on the NHS for kids, mum and dad, Gemma and Chris Grimshaw, both , from Calderdale, West Yorkshire, knew they would have a fight on their hands to answer his dreams. Police officer Gemma said: “I always thought Jacob coped well without his arm and got on with things, it was always the little things he struggled with like cutting up his food or putting his shoes on, but when he came home from school in tears I knew we had to do something. “We started raising money on Go Fund Me in February this year. I knew what we wanted would cost an awful lot of money. We thought we would have to go to America.”  The family had raised £, by September and started to look online at how to make it happen.Amazingly, Gemma stumbled across a man called Ben Ryan, from Menai Bridge on Anglesey, Wales, on Instagram .Mr Ryan made his mark on the prosthetic world after going from psychology teacher to engineer after creating an arm for his own child when an accident at birth meant he lost his arm at  days old. The innovator used his own psychology expertise to consider that his son, Sol, named after the solar eclipse that was happening at the time of this birth, should wear a prosthetic as soon as possible so he can adapt better. Sol, now four, has been wearing his own prosthetic since he was five weeks old and even learned to crawl wearing it.  Mr Ryan is now CEO of his own company Ambionics, and Director of Glaze Prosthetics UK, a Polish company that Ben has merged with. Jacob is one of their first patients. Mr Ryan said: “The reason why Jacob is the first child to have a powered arm is not necessarily because the technology wasn’t there, but rather that parents do not know it is something that is possible.  “Jacob’s family is unusual in this case in that when they were told they had to wait for a prosthetic or were told that it would not work for him they refused to give in and kept looking for answers - I was the same. “They kept going and luckily they found me.” The company has worked together with prosthetic service provider Dorset Orthopaedics to create Jacob’s fab new arm in just  weeks.

Mr Barton said: “A few months back I lost my job because of mental health issues. I’d been late a few times because of it and I was in my probation period so they let me go. “Now I have zero money and I can’t even afford Christmas presents for my little boy. I know presents aren’t everything but he’s five-years-old and it matters at that age. “I’m still struggling with my depression and just putting a roof over my head. My rent is in arrears and I’ve missed bills. It’s made me feel like s**t, really terrible. I’ve been made to feel really small, like I’m a rubbish dad.”  Mr Barton said his son is keeping him going, adding: “It’s the thought of my little boy needing a dad and the hope that things will change is what’s getting me through but there are days where I feel fed up and worthless. “If anyone  is in the same situation I just want to say do not give up and believe in yourself.” Mr Barton said he began experiencing mental health problems when his relationship with Alexanderaposs mother broke down about three years ago. He said: “I worried about my family splitting up and not seeing my son again.

The dad uses his parentsapos house as a base to meet with his son because his own home doesnapost have a bed for the boy. He said he is grateful to Alexander’s mother and grandparents for their part in looking after him.  Mr Barton, who recently appeared on the BBCaposs Victoria Derbyshire programme to discuss his dire situation, said he used his last paycheck to cover his rent and bills for October. He said he will not receive his first Universal Credit payment until January. He added: “I apply for jobs every single day.

Gail Ewens stayed at the Hotel Campanile in Hull while visiting her daughter at university. But the  year old was so disappointed by her experience, she has demanded a full refund. She said: “The bathroom was basic with broken tiles and mould, the carpet it was dirty and it was one of the worst night’s sleep I’ve ever had - the springs were terrible. It was like the room at the hotel in Psycho.She says the problems started on arrival, Hull Live reports.Due to an ongoing Humberside Police investigation, all guests must provide photo ID when they check in. Ms Ewens admits she had missed the email informing her of this but was still angry about the way she says she was treated. She said: “I arrived last night and didn’t check my email which said I would need a photo ID, but it was like talking to a robot on the desk, I’d already paid for the room. “The manager wasn’t there so I phoned someone who then started lecturing me about this thing that is happening with the police. “It was late at night, there was nowhere  I could go. In the end they told me out of the goodness of their hearts they would let me stay. There was just not empathy or sympathy.” She also highlighted the disparity between the hotel’s reception and the rooms where guests actually stay. “The reception area was lovely, she said. It was almost like a child neglect case with the parents living the le of Riley at the front of the house while the kids are left to fend for themselves at the back. Ms Ewens claims she made her feelings known the next day but was told by staff there was nothing that could be done. “The management acknowledged the problems but said it was run by people in France and locally there was nothing they could do apart from put in requests,” she said. Ms Ewens said she will continue to visit the city but said she will not be ing to Hotel Campanile. She said: “I have nothing against Hull but I think that place is a disgrace and lets the city down.” A spokesman for Campanile said: “The safety and security of our guests is our utmost priority and as a result of safeguarding issues in the local area, we have been working closely with Humberside Police to enhance the hotel’s security policies. “All guests are made aware at the time of booking that photographic ID is required and will need to be presented upon check-in.

Buyers have been scared off by the  tombstones in the garden of the converted Methodist church. The newly-renovated, three-bedroom property has never been lived in. Selling agents Bedfords have failed to flog it for more than  months. They have dropped the price of the Grade II listed property from £, - in April  when it first went on the market - to £,. Yet despite the massive discount, Bedfords are still struggling to attract buyers at the spooky mansion. Partner Emmerson Dutton maintains that anyone who can look beyond the tombstones will be getting a bargain. He said: “It’s such a nice house, they have done an amazing job on it. “We have dropped the price on a number of occasions, for the money you will not find a better building. “But the graves are the problem, rightly or wrongly. “It wouldn’t bother me, but it clearly does many others.” He joked: “They’re usually a quiet bunch.” Mr Dutton explained that many prospective buyers said they would not discuss the house because of the tombs. “If someone does have the inclination to look at it, regardless of the graves, they will get a really good value house,” he said. The agent said he hoped to finally flog the property in the new year. “Market conditions haven’t been ideal, but the graves keep coming up as the main problem,” Mr Dutton added. “I think come the new year, someone will discover it and see a beautully renovated chapel conversion.” The former church resides in the picturesque Norfolk village of North Lopham. The chapel was built in , but went out of service five years ago as the congregation dwindled. It has since been converted to a modern family home, but the original buyers never moved in.  Buyers can’t remove the tombstones as they are owned by the Church of England for another  years. The main door of the property has been moved to round the back of half-an-acre site, with a spacious garden. The driveway is to the right of the house, so occupants would rarely have to look at the spooky tombstones out front. The house has three bedrooms and a modern open plan kitchen. As well as prospective buyers, ghost hunters have to come to look at the graves. One group wanted to bring their tuning fork to trace the spirits. Many of the inscriptions on the graves are still visible. There are  headstones still standing in the garden, with  leant against the building.

Her mother passed away a couple of years ago and her dad is in Lithuania - he is going to come and see her in January. Myself and her colleagues have all been to see her in hospital and brought her heaps of goodies. We just want to do anything we can to help. Daniel, who has been dating Edita for  years , added: Iaposve barely been away from the hospital since it happened. She had an operation to treat her ankle and another to treat her back. Edita has had pins put into her back. She has been sleeping a lot due to the pain in her shoulder and the impact of the injuries. The medical care she has had has been amazing. She means the world to me.

When you are full of confidence you try things you wouldn’t do when it’s low.“The only way it is going to come back is by picking up results and grafting in training.“Hopefully, we can turn things soon.”Dundee head back to Dens Park aiming to rebuild their relationship with the home faithful after some very disappointing displays.However, Byrne says the Pars are a perfect example of how quickly things can turn around after three straight wins has seen Stevie Crawford’s side shoot up the ision.Byrne said: “We’ve got to win the fans round but we have to do it for ourselves as well.“It’s down to us to get results. We know it hasn’t been good enough as a team and inidually, so we need to get results. Only those will get fans back onside.”He added: “You could see when we got our three wins in a row it pushed us right up the table and you can see that now with Dunfermline.“I think they were down in mid-table and now they are up in third. One result can change a lot in this league and we need that.“Dunfermline will come here confident after a few good results but we are at home and we need to use that advantage.“We had a decent home record up until the last few. We need to get wins here and make this a hard place to come.”Byrne began his career with Dunfermline in the old First Division before moving on to Livingston after three years.There are still one or two old faces around the club he remembers but the midfielder insists his only focus is on his own, and the team’s, performance.“It’s a club I know really well and they gave me a chance to play in the first team,” he added.“I have a lot of good memories there but it was a long time ago now. I want to concentrate on doing well for Dundee, though.“I know myself I’ve not been good enough. I’ve had some good games but I’ve not played well consistently enough week to week.“When we got those three wins in October I was starting to feel good. Inidually, I know I can be a lot better.“I’m not going to say I’m going to do this and that. I can only work as hard as possible and I’m sure it will come together again and I can get back to how I was playing last season and enjoying things again.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/Teddy-Bear-Toss-07-12-19-02.jpg ","title":"dundee stars shine for sick children with generous donation","story":"Hockey players made a n-ice gesture with a visit to Ninewells Hospital’s children’s ward.The Kitmart Dundee Stars took nearly  cuddly toys to the city hospital which had been hurled on to the ice at their annual teddy toss match.More than  bears hurtled on to the surface and smashed last year’s record total of  which were then given out to city charities.Dundee Stars captain, Matt Marquardt, was one of the players who handed out the toys to children at Ninewells and explained the touching ice hockey tradition. vw, px\"  He said: “It was a great afternoon delivering the teddy bears to the kids.“It’s always wonderful to help put smiles on the children’s faces during these dficult times for them and their families.“Also, we want to thank all the fans who contributed to the teddy bear toss.”Play specialist Una Paton added: “The children had great fun and were very excited to meet the team.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/5c9395086ee127.15107893-846x564.jpg ","title":"mcmullan returns for arbroath clash","story":"Dundee United are set to welcome Paul McMullan back to the fold for tomorrow’s trip to Arbroath.The winger sat out Tuesday night’s - win at Morton with a groin strain picked up in the previous match against Alloa.However, the -year-old is expected to be fit for the Gayfield clash as United aim to pick up their eighth win in a row and stretch their -point lead at the top of the Championship.Terrors boss Robbie Neilson said: “He’ll be fine, he did a bit of training yesterday and we’re hopeful he’ll do full training today.“He had a problem in the game against Alloa but managed to get through the match.“We hoped it would settle down because it’s something he had a month or two ago as well.“He’ll be ready for tomorrow.”Robbie also gave an update on Peter Pawlettand Cammy Smithwith the former set to miss out once again.He added: “Peter’s going to be another couple of weeks.

We were over three hours on the bus so it’s a heck of a journey for them.“To come out on a Tuesday night when they’ve probably got work in the morning, it’s a great effort.“If they can stick by us and we continue to churn out results it can only be a good thing.”Smith hailed former Ayr Untied team-mate Shankland for his scoringat Cappielow but reserved special praise for young hitman Appere.“The big man’s done brilliant,” he said of the -year-old.“I wasn’t here when he was out on loan , I’ve only seen him from the start of the season and I’ve been really impressed with him.“His whole game is improving all the time. He’s maybe been stuck out wide a bit just assisting but now he’s getting the goals as well. It’s brilliant for him.“If we can have our three strikers scoring goals it can only be a good thing.“If we can keep producing for them by keeping the goals out at the other end then we’re only going to be going one way.”As they head for Gayfield at the weekend, Smith is keen to make it a perfect three wins from three this week.“It’s another tricky one. Going up there is never easy either and they’re doing really well.“We’re under no illusions how dficult a game that will be.“We’ve been treating every game with the utmost respect to who we’re playing against and,we can keep the run going, then it will stand us in good stead.“Confidence is high, that’s seven wins on the bounce now and  points clear.“If we take it a game at a time now and keep on winning then no one is going to catch us.“That’s what we aim to do – win every game.”Smith is enjoying le on and off the pitch at Tannadice and admits the proximity to home in Fe is a big bonus.“My girlfriend and I moved through so we’re settled and enjoying it.“I’m from Fe so it’s not that far from home either.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed.

People in Achnamara decided to join the growing number of communities getting involved in building a community boat through the Scottish Coastal Rowing Association , which encourages boat building and rowing and racing of coastal rowing boats around the Scottish coastline.The principle is that the boats should be available at as low a price as possible, with the estimated cost of completion being around £, according t the SCRA.The skf # with the St Ayles name coming from the former chapel which now forms the entrance to the Scottish Fisheries Museum # is  feet in , with a beam of ##.  The standard crew is four rowers and a coxswain.A hard core of nine to  regulars from the Achnamara area, with help from others as available, have been beavering away on their as-yet-nameless skf.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll and bute goes to the westminster polls","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPolling stations were busy from the time they opened at am for the first December general election since .Polling stations will close at pm across the UK, after which Argyll and Bute ballot boxes will be transported by road, sea and air to the constituency count at Lochgilphead Joint Campus.As one of the largest and most geographically dispersed constituencies in the country # including  inhabited islands # the time between the first voting papers arriving and the last will be considerable.When all the ballot boxes have arrived and counting is complete, the results will be veried before being formally announced, with the result expected around am on Friday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

A second followed when a nice cross field pass left Aitken clear and he coolly put the ball behind the keeper.Cathcart tried to stage a fight back and pulled a goal back as Star stuttered for a few minutes but McMurchy restored Star’s two goal lead when he finished from a tight angle. Halftime - for Star.The second half was again dominated by the Lochgilphead boys. The fourth goal was an excellent solo effort from Caskie and effectively killed the game as a contest.Aitken added goal number five when his fierce strike from wide zipped into the net. The sixth and final goal came in the final minutes when the Cathcart keeper parried a long range effort which was pounced on by West who placed the rebound beyond the unlucky goalie.A great result against second placed Cathcart which hopefully sets Star up nicely for the rest of the season."},{"url":null,"title":"lots-beauty-nothing-tame-beast-show","story":"FROM the opening bars of Wake Up Boo, this years Right Angle Theatre Company panto was yet another rip-roaring success.But director Derek Calder may want to rethink his casting after emotion and romance stole the show.Yes, Alan Frayns gags were good - particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents - Mitchells pure Galae and Blacklocks Essex - worked a treat.Craig Douglass De Niro-sounding Gustave also had his fair share of one-liners in his attempts to deflect the unwanted attentions of Whitney and Britney.And both Julie Smith, as Madame Le Fou, and Scott Robertson, as Alphonse, were a delight with their over-the-top performances.A panto, though, isnt a panto without a dame.The Right Angle Theatre Company appears to have a natural - Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do -

This output is expected to increase next week, when they will employ an additional three workers.At present  bags of the #queenie# scallops are being processed daily. By the beginning of December it is hoped that  bags will be handled.Mr George McMillan said that it is hoped eventually to employ from  to  people. He stressed that meantime Davaar Seafoods was occupying only part of the slaughterhouse building on a temporary basis. He mentioned that the firm was #hoping to get the whole building#.Samples of Davaar Seafoods produce were sent to consumers in Chicago and Paris and opinions passed on the quality of the samples were favourable.The scallop processing method employed is a simple one. The shellfish are dipped into hot water, and the shells open. The insides of the creatures are removed and scraped clean. Then the meat is thoroughly washed.Shellfish factories are operating successfully in Tarbert and Port Ellen.Harmony Hour guests of R.A.F. on thThe th of November,  will long be remembered by the members of Campbeltown Harmony Hour Club who were guests at an excellent fireworks display at R.A.F.

Burnley Campbell, and others also extended a cordial welcome, the men being cheered as they marched with the colours to headquarters.The cadre was entertained at a civic luncheon in McColl#s Hotel in the afternoon.Those present said they were delighted to welcome home the local battalion. Throughout the war they had watched with pride the heroic work performed by the battalion, and they would remember with gratitude the sacrices that had been made.Maclachlan of Maclachlan mentioned that the total casualties of the  th Argylls during the war were  officers and  other ranks.The honours of the regiment received were one V.C., two D.S.O.#s, many M.C.#s and M.M.#s, and other lesser honours.Major Lockie, who commanded the cadre, acknowledged the cordial welcome they had received.A day of remembranceThe King#s desire that the first anniversary of the Armistice should be observed by a two minutes silence in reverent remembrance of the glorious dead was fulfilled all over the country on Tuesday.In London wreaths were laid on the Cenotaph in Whitehall. These included one from the King and Queen, one from President Poincaré and one from the Prime Minister.The scenes in the streets of Glasgow were full of solemnity, when all traffic stopped and the crowds stood in reverent silence as the clocks stuck eleven. Work ceased in the Clyde shipyards and on the shipping in the river.In Campbeltown the signal was given by the sounding of three long syren blasts from H.M.S. Thames, and the fallen were honoured by the uncovering of heads.Of course in a comparatively quiet country town the tribute lacked the impressiveness that characterised it in busy cities.In the Grammar School the scholars assembled in the large room at .a.m., when the rector gave a short address on the meaning of the celebration, read the King#s message, and explained shortly the aims of the League of Nations Union.A hymn as then sung, the two minutes# silence observed, and after the National Anthem had been sung, the pupils were dismissed for the day.In Dalintober School the period of silence was similarly observed and the scholars were afterwards dismissed."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 15 2019","story":"Remembrance is one of the main topics in this week#s Courier.We increasingly rely on our youngsters to keep the memory of the First and Second World Wars alive as those who experienced them first-hand # and second-hand # fade away.Renowned First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was himself killed in action in , wrote of #the old lie# # #Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori#, which translates from Latin as #It is sweet and proper to die for one#s country#.Remembrance should not be about glorying war, but remembering the horric atrocities which are committed in its name so that in future they may be avoided.The four young people who took part in the service at Glenbarr War Memorial are direct descendants of men from the area who fell in battle.

With a few patches of articial snow here and there it could well have been in Siberia. There were great hoots and laughter at the showing whenever those in the audience recognised their pals in unorm with rles at the ready or being carried in on stretchers.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet.

to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus

it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people

It was a massive punch in the gut for Labourrsquos youthful idealists in their Twitter bubble, who canrsquot understand why working-class people would vote for anEton-educated Tory.In Scotland, they didnrsquot. The SNP surprised itself by almost repeating the tsunami SNP surge of . An astonishing achievement for Nicola Sturgeon and confirmation that Scotland and England are growing further apart faster.When Boris Johnson hailed a victory for ldquoone nation Conservatism, he inadvertently spoke the truth. It did apply in only one nation: England. Scotland is now, in a very real sense, another country. There may not be a referendum next year ndash Boris Johnsonrsquos crushing majority in Westminster will see to that. But something will have to give.Resurgent Scottish nationalism, and the most unionist Prime Minister in Westminster since Margaret Thatcher, is an unstable and potentially explosive combination. Everything and anything is now possible, including a court battle over a Scottish referendum. Nicola Sturgeon is demanding that Holyrood gets the power to call referendums. That wonrsquot happen.But donrsquot be surprisedBoris Johnson makes a blue-sky offer of federalism hersquos supported it in the past. As the UK leaves the European Union ndash the one certainty after Thursday ndash Johnson will try to do a side deal with Scotland, as he did with the DUP. Just donrsquot expect it to be all that it seems.Hopes that a hung parliament would deliver a Scottish independence referendum, with the SNP striking a deal with Labour, died on Thursday night. It was curtains too for the Corbyn project. Though there will likely be a continuing civil war in the Labour Party over the succession. Shades again of the s.The first General Election I covered was , so there was a distinct sense of having been through this movie before. Indeed, I wrote in this paper only three weeks ago that Labourrsquos manesto might end up as another ldquolongest suicide note in history. That was how Labourrsquos  effort was famously described by the Labour MP Gerald Kaufman.Some left-wing folk said it was somehow morally wrong to criticise that document, with its intergalactic spending plans improbably financed by a % tax hike on people earning over pound,. Imperviousness to constructive criticism has been one of the hallmarks of Corbynism. Labour chose to listen to the hyperventilating keyboard warriors on Twitter who attack anyone deviating from the line as a ldquoTory shill.Yet, it should have been clear to everyone that there was something deeply suspect about Labourrsquos multiple manesto giveaways. The % pay hike for public-sector workers, free broadband, cheap rail fares, the four-day week, the belated bung of pound billion to the Waspi women. This wasnrsquot social democracy, it was retail politics gone mad. It culminated in Labourrsquos promise that every family would be pound, better off. People just arenrsquot that stupid.If Labour had confined itself to a few well-defined and credible offers on health spending, tuition fees and rail nationalisation, it might have worked. Thatrsquos what the Tories did, with their simple message of new hospitals and more nurses. However, the manesto was only part of Labourrsquos problem. Corbyn was also sunk by his policy, or lack of it, on Brexit.How Labour thought that they could win with their leader pretending to have no view on the biggest issue facing the country in half a century defies belief. Again, s of the galaxy on social media insisted that ldquohersquos just being an honest broker ... keeping options open ... uniting the country. Nonsense. It was an irresponsible abdication of leadership. Labourrsquos policy on Brexit was as dishonest as it was cynical. Dishonest: because everyone knew that Jeremy Corbyn was a lelong opponent of the European Union. Cynical: because Labourrsquos metropolitan Remainers hoped ldquoconstructive ambiguity would fool provincial Brexit voters into believing that Corbyn really would renegotiate a better Brexit deal in three months.No-one bought it. The Labour leaderrsquos inability to say who would actually lead his Brexit negotiation, still less campaign for it, was one of the many face-palm moments in a campaign that left my face and palm red raw. Blaming BBC bias only made it worse.Of course, Corbynrsquos personality and style of politics was also aturn-off, and the press made a lot of his past associations with IRA supporters and Hamas. But theyrsquod tried that unsuccessfully in . This time, the Labour leader somehow managed to be even more unpopular in Scotland than his bumptious Etonian Tory rival. How could that possibly be  Hadnrsquot John McDonnell all but promised a second independence referendum  Arenrsquot Scottish voters supposed to be more left-wing The aversion to Corbyn was mostly down to the national question. But I suspect many Scots shared with Labour voters in England an aversion to Corbynrsquos particular brand of London Labour politics. His sympathy, however justied, with the Palestinian cause, obscure LGBTQIA+ demands and, of course, his views on immigration and defence. It left many patriotic provincial voters uncomfortable.This doesnrsquot mean that socially conservative Labour voters are all homophobes and racists. Polls repeatedly confirm that the vast majority of English, and Scots, voters harbour no ill will towards gay people or racial minorities. But they arenrsquot exactly passionate about transgender toilet arrangements or uncontrolled immigration. And millions voted for BrexitThinly-disguised contempt for working-class Brexit voters was evident throughout the campaign. Labour-friendly comedians like Steve Coogan and Nish Kumar condemned them as ldquoignorant and racist. Did they think they werenrsquot listening Labour activists on Twitter talked about the ldquowhite working class astheyrsquore a lumpen mass of unaddressed bigotry. The Corbynite intellectual, Paul Mason, called the election ldquoa victory of the old over the young, racists over people of colour, selfishness over the planet. Not perhaps the best way to attract back core Labour voters in Blyth, Bolsover, Sedgefield.What middle-class intellectuals failed to understand is that, in post-crash Britain, the politics of nation has largely eclipsed the politics of class. The election results north and south of the Border may appear wildly dferent, but they are both expressions of populist nationalism.Brexit is essentially English nationalism. It is a revolt by people the writer David Goodhart calls the ldquosomewheres, in the provinces, against the remain-voting elites, or ldquoanywheres, in urban centres. ldquoSomewheres feel left out by globalisation, as their jobs have gone abroad and mass immigration has altered their communities.Tories since Disraeli have understood the potency of national identity as a unying force. People who lack the mobility conferred by a university education tend to love their country. They have little  to hold on to in an age of insecurity and rapid change. Get Brexit Done was an English version of Make America Great Again.And though the politics are dferent, Brexit is not so far removed from what happened in Scotland during and after the financial crash. In , the Scottish working classes in the housing estates and inner cities entered politics in unprecedented numbers to vote for independence. The Yes campaign was inspired by feelings of national identity, community and Scotsrsquo love of their country. Plus the hope that an independent Scottish Government would look after them better than remote Westminster.It may be naiumlve, it may be nationalistic, it certainly is populist. But identity is a powerful political mobiliser in an age of insecurity and mistrust. People want to belong, to feel that they are part of something bigger than themselves. National identity gives them that.But the problem with nationalism is that tends to be exclusive. Scotland and England are expressing identity in dferent and contradictory ways ndash the former in a spirit of pro-European internationalism the latter in a more inward-looking, nativist anti-Europeanism. These are irreconcilable opposites.Nicola Sturgeon has often said that she would like to drop the word ldquonational from the SNPrsquos name. She clearly feels uncomfortable with the politics of nationalism, despite having been an SNP supporter all her le. And she has good reason to be wary, given the behaviour of some European nationalist parties.Her task now will be to contain the fervour of her triumphant party and constructively channel their hatred of English conservatism. It wonrsquot be easy. Boris Johnson has provoked the Scots by ruling out any referendum for at least five years. Scotland is about to be dragged kicking and screaming out of Europe.Sturgeon is a cautious politician, unlike her predecessor Alex Salmond, and will not tolerate civil disobedience or unconstitutional behaviour.But like it or not, she has a fight on her hands. A national reckoning is coming."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Seven things we learned from the 2019 election","story":"What we do know for sure, however, is that many folk down south were persuaded that they really, really want Brexit. A fundamental sht has taken place, not only in Englandrsquos mindset, but the manner in which its voters were induced to back Mr Johnson.What  have we learned from this extraordinary election  Well, herersquos my initial take. I look forward to hearing yours.. The ruthless, despicable tactics used by Dominic Cummings and Vote Leave to win the EU referendum campaign were not an aberration. As Mr Johnsonrsquos victory highlights, they are the new norm. Wersquore going to have to get used to digital s and elements of the media spreading misinformation like wildfire, possible foreign interventions, bamboozling distraction techniques, blatant dishonesty during broadcast interviews. How the Conservativesrsquo opponents respond will be crucial. Play it clean and be crushed, or get dirty, too, and join in them in the moral sell-out  You decide.. Simple slogans ndash especially those created by the aforementioned Cummings ndash really do work. By the end of the campaign just about every voter vox-popped in England seemed to be parroting the ldquowe just need to get Brexit done line. This undoubtedly helped consolidate the pro-Brexit vote around the Tories.. Labourrsquos claim to be the party of working people no longer stands up. Jeremy Corbyn and his disciples can blame media bias for his partyrsquos disastrous result till the cows come home but it wonrsquot change the fact that their man and his policies were a monumental turn-off across the partyrsquos traditional heartlands. Labourrsquos disastrous stance on Brexit didnrsquot help, but the rejection goes deeper. The fact that people living in poverty believed Boris Johnson would look after their interests better than a lelong socialist is both grim and fascinating. Sadly for the poor, we canrsquot bet on Labour facing up to these harsh truths any time soon.. Speaking of Labour claims that donrsquot stand up, we can surely all now agree that a Labour government is not going to ldquosave Scotland, either from the Tories or independence. This ridiculous and out-dated argument was still being peddled on doorsteps, not only by London-based Labour but many in the Scottish party, too. It really would be in the partyrsquos interests to accept that comparing independence ndash which for the vast majority of supporters is based on a simple desire for self-determination ndash to Farage-style nationalism is not only highly insulting, but as wersquove seen for years, electoral suicide. There have been signs over the weekend that at least some in Scottish Labour are waking up. Too little, too late  Quite possibly.. The evisceration of the Lib Dems tells us that Jo Swinson ran a flawed campaign based on a fatal overestimation of her own popularity. It also suggests England doesnrsquot like three-party politics.Or hung parliaments. You can kiss goodbye to any thoughts of electoral reform.. The SNP-Tory stand-off over Indyref cannot go on forever. Both sides are already upping the ante, with Mr Johnson and Michael Gove categorically ruling out another referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon intensying the narrative with talk of Scotland being ldquoheld prisoner. Such shadow boxing plays well to both partiesrsquo core support, of course, but eventually one side will have to go for the knockout blow. Itrsquos hard to see what more Ms Sturgeon can do in the face of such denials and hypocrisyfrom a tin-eared PM buoyed by a right-wing majority, at least until the Holyrood elections of . However Mr Johnson, who purports to be a classical scholar, would do well to learn lessons from more recent events, not least the unstoppable push for devolution that resulted from Mrs Thatcherrsquos condescending and contemptuous attitude towards Scotland during her - year stint as PM. The unpredictable nature of the Johnson-Cummings premiership means you never know what will happen, of course. Will they fancy calling the SNPrsquos bluff  Time will tell.. Meantime, the SNP needs to fashion fresh and persuasive arguments for independence in the post-Brexit world, with palatable solutions to the dficult questions and scenarios created by the UK leaving the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-leonard-announces-election-review-include-clear-constitutional-offer-scotland","story":"While it is unclear as to what this would be, the development came as senior colleagues openly questioned the partyrsquos opposition to a second independence referendum in light of the SNP landslide.The Scottish Labour leader, following a weekend meeting of the partyrsquos executive to discuss the election result, in which Scottish Labour was again left with just a solitary MP - Ian Murray representing Edinburgh South ndash said it was ldquocrucial we learn the lessons of our defeat.He explained: ldquoWe owe this to Scotlandrsquos communities, workplaces and most vulnerable people, who are now facing the prospect of five years more years of Tory Government.A swt evidence-based review of the election campaign would begin in the coming weeks to chart a way forward and see why voters, desperate for change, no longer felt Scottish Labour was the vehicle to realise that change.ldquoWe must develop a clear constitutional offer that wins back the confidence of voters who in this election felt that we did not offer clarity over Scotlandrsquos future.:Mark Smith: Inside the minds of the unionists who voted SNP ndash and what it means for Throughout the campaign the emphasis changed on when a Corbyn Government, while opposed to independence, might facilitate another referendum from up to three years to just ruling one out next year.Mr Leonard urged his party that in the coming weeks and months, it was more important than ever it remained united.ldquoNeither the status quo nor the SNPrsquos vision for cuts and separation offers the way forward for Scotland and we owe it to the people of Scotland to offer a clear prospectus for a transformed society and economy, Mr Leonard added.However, his partyrsquos opposition to indyref is now being openly questioned by senior colleagues, who, while they continued to oppose Scotland breaking away from the rest of the UK, nonetheless believe a second vote on the nationrsquos future is justied.Monica Lennon, Scottish Labourrsquos health spokeswoman, made clear while she was opposed to independence, \"people in Scotland have voted in very large numbers for the SNP, including many Labour voters\".She told the Sunday Mail: \"The SNP blueprint for independence is flawed and will disappoint many progressive Scots who are fed up with austerity. Nevertheless, the future of Scotland must be decided by the people of Scotland.\"Former Scottish Labour MP Ged Killen, who lost the Rutherglen and Hamilton West seat to the SNP, signalled his agreement on Twitter.He said: \"I campaigned on a promise to vote against indyref, but I lost. The SNP made massive gains on a promise to hold another referendum and, as democrats, we must accept it evenwe dont like it.\"His colleague, Neil Findlay MSP, argued: ldquoWe cannot deny the people of Scotland a second referendum where the majority is calling for it.The MSP for Lothian stressed how he believed that independence would be bad for Scotland for many reasons, noting how there would be big issues at stake such as the currency, borders, EU membership and falling oil revenues.He added: ldquoHowever,the people accept a new prospectus for independence, so be it. That is democracy and,it happens, Labour should offer its own prospectus for a progressive, socialist, outward-looking and egalitarian independent country.The Labour politiciansrsquo comments came after Labour councillor Alison Evison, the President of the local authority group Cosla, said democracy could be strengthened \"by enabling the voice of Scotland to be heard through its formal processes\", adding: \"That must mean a referendum on independence.Meanwhile, Kezia Dugdale argued opponents of independence needed to find a new argument for keeping Scotland in the UK.The former Scottish Labour leader, who stood down as an MSP earlier this year, told No campaigners: \"Youre wasting precious time arguing about mandates.ldquoLast referendum won by persuading centre-left voters  EU membership only safe in UK  A progressive Labour gov was on the horizon  Currency and Economic security.\"Reasons  and  have melted away and the Yes movement have been working on  since .:Nicola Sturgeon: Scotland cant be imprisoned within UK against its will - Michael Gove: no indyref under Tories\"You need a new argument for the Union which isnt rooted in Queen and country Unionism.

It is welcome that senior figures within Labour are recognising that mandate.ldquoWhile we will not all agree on independence, we can surely find common ground that this decision must be in Scotlandrsquos hands not Boris Johnsons, added the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber."},{"url":null,"title":"andy-maciver-tories-cant-keep-saying-no-scotland","story":"In Scotland, we would be well-served by dialling it down, for the focus is, once again, about to sht north. Brexit,not lsquodonersquo, is certainly now decided. The government will do what the people asked it to do nearly four years ago, and leave the EU. Thatrsquos good: I voted Remain, but I lost, and in a democracy, you must allow the winners to win.How do we relate that concept of the mandate, of democracy, to Scotland and to independence  That is the question which we will now wrestle with as Scots over the next  months, and quite probably for years thereafter, with the attention of the UK and the world on us.:Mark Smith: Inside the minds of the unionists who voted SNP ndash and what it means for The discussion has begun it began at .pm on Thursday night after the exit poll predicted another surge towards the SNP. Inevitably, the SNP claimed a mandate for indyref. It was the fourth time such a mandate had been claimed since the  independence referendum. The first was in , after the SNPrsquos -seat landslide the second was in June , after the UKrsquos Brexit vote fulfilled the SNPrsquos manesto criteria of Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will the third was after the party won the  General Election, and this was the fourth.Opposing, the Tories, of course, claimed that no such mandate exists. They cite ious reasons, principally that in this election many SNP candidates expressly said a vote for them was not a vote for indyref and that the SNPrsquos campaign slogan was lsquoStop Brexitrsquo, as well as the old favourite, that the  independence referendum was claimed by the SNP at the time to be lsquoonce in a generationrsquo.The reality, political and democratic, lies somewhere in between these competing claims. The strongest of all the SNPrsquos claimed mandates is, in fact, the one which emanated from the combination of the  Holyrood election and the Brexit referendum. The manesto called for a second referendum in the event of certain circumstances and specically cited the circumstance of the UK voting to leave the EU with Scotland voting to remain.I take the view that this qualies as a mandate, but I accept that it is not so clear as to be inarguable. It was by definition caveated, and its electoral endorsement is partly tied to a contorted pledge in the Green manesto which, as far as it is understandable, has probably not been met.The Tories, too, have a point. Whilst their lsquoonce in a generation argumentrsquo is bogusthe argument that last Thursdayrsquos election does not constitute a specic mandate is solid.The voting patterns in Scotland were quite clear - the Tory vote stayed relatively solid and the collapsing Labour vote went primarily to the SNP, and to a degree to the Lib Dems, both on the basis of Brexit. This was a Brexit election in Scotland just as it was in England, and that was the key driver for voters with pencil in hand.A sensible discussion between Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon could bring common ground and common sense to the frenzy. Sturgeon should find it easy to accept that there will be no referendum in , mainly because it is an open secret that she and her team do not actually want a referendum next year, with their pro-independence polling numbers looking far weaker than they had expected them to, given the perfect storm of Boris and Brexit.:Nicola Sturgeon takes constitutional fight to Boris Johnson with SNP pledge to do absolutely everything to secure  voteSimilarly, Johnson, fresh off a campaign which was based on upholding democracy by lsquogetting Brexit donersquo as the people had asked, should be able to relate to a clear indyref mandate emerging from an election in which it will be the main issue.This all points to the  Scottish Parliament election - the most important there has ever been. That election will be fought on very clear ground, with very likely no room for debate on anything other than indyref. If the SNP wins that election with a clear manesto commitment for a second vote, a full two parliamentary terms after their first win, there can be no serious grounds to oppose it.You canrsquot be a fair-weather democrat. You canrsquot demand to get Brexit done because voters asked for it whilst demanding that indyref is continually rejected despite voters asking for it.For Johnson to concede this point, the Scottish Tories will need to play a key role, and their position over the coming months will be worth analysing. Although under the circumstances, they ed a creditable result last Thursday, they should not allow it to paper over the cracks which are clearly there.The Tory strategy ndash no to indyref ndash was designed to expand its vote by encouraging Labour unionists to lend their vote to the Tories. That strategy crashed and burned on Thursday. Are the Tories, who have become institutionally obsessed with indyref, nimble enough to reflect upon the fact that they may have maximised that ultra-Unionist vote  I am not so sure.A subtle change in position could help them, whilst also providing them with a more credible, democratic position on indyref to match the credible, democratic position they have held on Brexit.Their position has been lsquovote for us and we will stop indyrefrsquo they should alter it ahead of  to lsquovote for us or we will not be able to stop indyrefrsquo. In other words, the party should acknowledge that a mandate in  will have to be respected, and there will have to be another independence referendum, soyou donrsquot want one then you had better vote Tory.This change in strategy would serve three purposes. Firstly, it would incentivise the core vote in just as compelling a way as the current strategy - frankly, itrsquos not as though they are going to vote for anyone . Secondly, it would respect democracy, and in times such as these, that would be a noble act. Thirdly, and most importantly, it would be a departure of the tired, old, failed Tory strategy of the last  years, which in the final analysis has always been: say no to Scotland.Not for the first time in Scottish Tory history, they are struggling to see that this is failing, and is simply pushing people away from the Union and towards independence.The irony of all of this is that the Nationalistsrsquo strength is over-estimated by Unionists, who have become so paranoid about indyref that they seem blind to the fundamentals which are in place, and which may allow the unionists to record a larger win than last time, closing the book on independence just like they closed the book on Brexit.All they have to do is smarten up.

Both leaders benefited from voters doing what they wouldnrsquot normally do. In the case of the PM, it was Labour voters in the north of England voting Tory, and in the case of the First Minister, it was unionist voters supporting the SNP.

Many,not most, of the English voters who supported the Conservatives in traditionally Labour areas did so because they wanted to see Brexit happen, and many,not most, of the Scottish voters who supported the SNP in traditionally Conservative or Labour areas did so because they wanted to see Brexit stopped. In that sense, they voted for an outcome rather than a party.The conversations Irsquove had in the last few days with unionists who voted SNP have revealed a bit more about what that means. Most of them are still opposed to, or suspicious about, independence, and they agonised over whether voting SNP was the right thing to do. But, in the end, they concluded Brexit and a Tory government was the greater evil. One voter told me his vote for the SNP was in no way a pro-SNP vote, simply a way of ensuring a Brexit supporter did not win in his three-way marginal. ldquoIrsquom not a nationalist and never will be, he said.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Election : How the UK constituency map looks after Tory victory\",\"description\": \"Election : How the UK constituency map looks after Tory victory\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media ekuyFAjQ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests ekuyFAjQ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": However, this election was never going to be just about Brexit, and the unionists who voted SNP were aware of the other possible consequences of their vote. In the last bit of the campaign, the SNP appeared to play down independence and play up ldquoStop Brexit, but voters knew or suspected that Nicola Sturgeon would interpret support for her party as support for another independence referendum, which is precisely what happened. Admittedly, the First Minister did say that not everyone who voted SNP supported independence, but she also said her partyrsquos success provided a renewed, refreshed and strengthened mandate for a new Scottish referendum.This did not please the SNP-voting unionists I spoke to, even though they knew it was likely to happen. One said to me that Ms Sturgeonrsquos use of the election result was cynical and had made her less likely to vote SNP a second time. It might also have helpedthe First Minister had acknowledged the subtleties, nuances and conflicting emotions that led Scottish voters to act in ways they never had before, rather than rushing to claim a mandate for a second referendum.Weirdly ndash because hersquos anything but subtle ndash Boris Johnson actually did a better job of talking about this phenomenon of ldquolent votes. He could have sounded triumphalist he could have clenched his fists and cheered at the defeat of Labour candidates in traditionally Labour areas.But instead he said that he recognised some votersrsquo hands might have ldquoquivered before they put their cross in the Conservative box. He also said he knew that many of those voters probably intended to vote Labour next time round. Rather than claiming the voters as Tories, it was an acknowledgement of what was actually going on with some people, and Nicola Sturgeon should have done something similar in a lot more detail and with a lot more humility.:Nicola Sturgeon takes constitutional fight to Boris Johnson with SNP pledge to do absolutely everything to secure  voteMs Sturgeon and her advisors should also be cautious about what they take from this for the future. As my SNP-voting unionists explained, they voted the way they did in the general election mostly because they felt they had no choice. They were in constituencies where, because of the first-past-the-post system, voting SNP was the only way to maximise the chances of thwarting the Tory and voting against Brexit. Truthfully, they would rather have voted Labour or LibDem and in a proportional system, they would have done. But instead, because of the system we have and with Brexit as the main concern, reluctantly, fretfully, and with a heavy heart, they voted SNP.Obviously, the same rules will not apply when the  Scottish general election comes round: under proportional representation, voters will be free to vote for a party they believe in. This means many of those who voted SNP in  because of Brexit and Boris will revert to their previous choices in , not only because Brexit will presumably no longer be the issue it once was but because voters will understand that independence really will be on the ballot in  and therersquoll be no question about how their vote will be used by the SNP.Not everyone will behave in the same way of course. One of the voters I spoke to, a man who voted No in  and SNP this year, said he wouldnrsquot rule out supporting a future independence referendumit was the lesser of two evils.However, for other unionists who have just voted SNP, the  Scottish election will be a chance to vote against independence just as the  UK election was their chance to vote against Brexit. What this means is that, far from being the beginning of a surge for the SNP, the election wersquove just been through could be a high tide. Maybe the First Minister gets this. Maybe she realises some of the votes she won last week are only on loan. And maybe she should think about it a bit more before she clenches her fists in triumph."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc-consciously-played-part-labours-general-election-defeat-claims-mp","story":"Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald made the claims during an interview on BBC Radio rsquos Today programme.It came as the partyrsquos leadership battle descended into acrimony with Jeremy Corbyn facing renewed criticism and one of his key allies being accused of calling voters ldquostupid.Presenter Justin Webb asked Mr McDonald about Labourrsquos heavy losses and whether the partyrsquos leader played a part in that.Mr McDonald said: ldquoDonrsquot get me started on the media, Justin.

Pic: Ben James SNHBoth species are found in Scotlandrsquos network of Marine Protected Areasand the study modelled the links between populations in both protected and unprotected areas for the first time.The modelling - a joint initiative between SNH, Marine Scotland Science and Heriot Watt University - suggested that horse mussels and flame shells could reach and form beds in a number of new areas in Scottish waters. Seabed surveys in these areas may confirm the model predictions.Horse Mussels are similar to the blue mussels found on seashores but grow much larger, and can reach more than cm inand live for over  years.They live inidually or in clumps, or may form raised beds with several hundreds of mussels per square metre.Horse mussels live below the low water mark, with beds found at depths from  to  metres, although most known beds are between - metres.:Revealing the secrets of mussels as big as size nine shoes#The beds provide a foundation for soft corals, tubeworms, barnacles, sea firs, sea mats and seaweeds, as well as shelter for brittlestars, crustaceans, worms, molluscs and many other small animals.Flame shells, bivalve molluscs with a fringe of orange tentacles, live hidden on the seabed in nests which they build from shells, stones and other materials. Hundreds of nests can combine to form a dense bed, which stabilises the seabed and provides substrate for sea firs, sea mats, sea squirts and seaweed, as well as shelter for many other creatures, such as crabs, scallops and brittle stars.The habitat is found mainly on the west coast of Scotland, often in tidal narrows and the entrances to sea lochs, with the largest known flame shell bed in Loch Carron. There is also a flame shell bed in Scapa Flow on Orkney.In recent years both have come under threat due to dredging that scours the seabed in the search for fresh mussels.In July Marine Scotland said it was looking into claims an industrial vessel was last week scraping the bottom of Loch Broom near the Summer Isles.A er inspects damage to the mussel beds in Loch Carron. Pic: Chris RickardThis followed an incident last year where dredging was banned fromLoch Carron in Wester Ross following an investigation into claims the beds had been damaged by scallop dredging.SNH and Marine Scotland are working on a project to improve protection of sensitive habitats - including known horse mussel beds and flame shell beds - outside the MPA network.The research will help to identy locations where additional protection could improve connectivity between these habitats.

For some, Brexit represents a lsquomaterial change in circumstancersquo. For others, lsquoonce in generationrsquo still holds.ldquoMany of the economic debates will be similar to those in . But there are likely to be important dferences.ldquoFirstly, back in  there was a clear choice between a relatively stable lsquostatus quorsquo ndash albeit with the promise of more devolved powers ndash and independence.ldquoBut with Brexit, the debate will be set against the backdrop of economic change and uncertainty whatever the people of Scotland decide.ldquoVoters will also want to be much more mindful about what both sides can credibly say about their so-called Plan B than was the case in either  or the EU Referendum in .ldquoThe wider economic context has undoubtedly changed. Some aspects ndash such as the sharp fall in oil prices and weakening of Scotlandrsquos relative fiscal position ndash pose a challenge to those arguing in favour of independence.ldquoAgainst that, Brexit throws up economic challenges for those in favour of the Union.ldquoScotland may face a stark choice between aligning to the EU trading bloc or the UK bloc, with implications for trade and migration.ldquoPerhaps most signicantly, many of those on the Yes side in  argued that there would be a degree of continuity between the then status quo and independence. The plan was to retain sterling, share financial regulation and keep an open border.ldquoButthe case for a second referendum is now framed around Scotland pro-actively taking a dferent path to the UK, then it necessarily follows that the economic proposition for independence will need to be more radical on issues such as currency, customs and fiscal policy than in .In October, Ms Sturgeon refused to rule out infrastructure and customs checksBrexit was combined with Scottish independence in Europe.Her Brexit Secretary Michael Russell also admitted the EU could impose a hard border, saying it would be ldquogoverned by our membership of the EU, not settled domestically.:Boris Johnsonrsquos Brexit deal to be brought before Commons this weekThe Institutersquos commentary also warned of continued weak Scottish economic growth, with forecasts of . per cent for  and .% for  and , although these assumed Ms Johnson could deliver on his promise of a trade deal with the EU by the endof .Speaking ahead of her parliamentary statement, the First Minister said: ldquoThis election result is a watershed moment for Scotland.

Of course, we have game-planned this we have worked out a strategyhellipWe have a very strong case, he declared.:Neil Mackay: Englandrsquos voice has been heard. Now its Scotlandrsquos turnAsked again, the Highland MP again refused to reject the possibility of taking the Tory Government to court, saying: ldquoWe will come out with our plans later this week letrsquos put the proposition to the Government and take it from there.Under the shadow of Rodinrsquos Burghers of Calais statue next to the House of Lords, Mr Blackford headed a photocall of the -strong SNP force at Westminster.After cheers, hugs and kisses, he told reporters gathered in the failing light: ldquoLet me say to Boris Johnson: the SNP won the election in Scotland.ldquoWe won  per cent of the seats in Scotland. The Tories fought on one simple message say no to indyref. Well, Boris you got your answer you lost more than half your MPs you trailed  points behind the SNP respect democracy respect the Scotland people and recognise we should have that power to determine the timing of that referendum.Urging the PM to face up to reality, it was suggested to the party leader that neither he nor Ms Sturgeon could do anythingMr Johnson continued to say no.ldquoWersquoll see about that, declared Mr Blackford, ldquobecause itrsquos not a good look for Michael Gove or Boris Johnson or anyone  to turn round to the people of Scotland and say it doesnrsquot matteryou vote for a party and you give it a mandate, wersquore going to ignore you. Where is the democracy in that  All he is doing is pushing people towards the SNP.He thanked Scottish Labour figures for their ldquogenerosity of spirit in accepting the SNP had a mandate for indyref and claimed: ldquoThis movement towards having a referendum is unstoppable. Itrsquos simply the wrong thing to do for the Conservatives to stand in the face of that. This referendum is coming, it will happen and the sooner they recognise that the better.Mr Blackford claimed it was \"completely bogus\" to say that the Scottish people had already had their once-in-a-generation say on the future of Scotland.ldquoThe simple fact of the matter is in  when we had that referendum we were told thatwe stayed in the UK that our rights as EU citizens would be respected that promise has been broken and those changes of circumstances and the mandate that the Scottish Government won to the Scottish Parliament in , it is right that we have that referendum,\" he declared.When it was pointed out that Mr Johnson had a mandate from the whole of the UK that obliged him to refuse the SNPrsquos demand, given the Tory manesto commitment not to facilitate indyref, Mr Blackford replied: ldquoBoris Johnson lost the election in Scotland. It is the SNP that has a mandate from the Scottish people and that mandate must be honoured.:Boris Johnson tells new Tory intake of MPs Government must repay trust of electorate and deliverReiterating how the UK Governmentrsquos continued intransigence would be a ldquorecruiting sergeant for the SNP, the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber asserted: ldquoThis is a losing hand that Boris Johnson holds. We will have that referendum itrsquos better that that is done in the short term rather than having a protracted wrangle over this. Scotland will have the right to choose its future.Mr Blackford insisted with other parties \"subsumed by internal isions and acrimony, the SNP will provide real and effective opposition, challenging Boris Johnsons devastating plans every step of the way\". He said the Nationalists would hold the Tory Government to account in the \"face of Brexit, austerity cuts, the threat to our NHS and the climate crisis\".After some Labour figures, including MSPs Monica Lennon and Neil Findlay, suggested the SNP did, in the wake of their election landslide, have a mandate to call for a second independence vote, Pamela Nash, Chief Executive of Scotland in Union, took to social media to say: ldquoPretty scunnered by Labour figures saying that the vote on Thurs was a mandate for #indyref.ldquoIt clearly wasnrsquot, majority voted for pro-UK parties and SNP campaigned on lsquoStop Brexitrsquo, many saying this is why they voted for SNP  even Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged this on Friday.Ged Killen, the former Labour MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, who on Sunday accepted the SNP had a mandate to demand indyref, revealed he had received ldquolots of not unexpected criticism for his intervention.But he noted: ldquoRemember it was the Tories who agreed to the first indyref because the SNP won a mandate but now the pro-UK strategy appears to rely on denying the question, instead of defeating the argument. How sustainable is that in the long term The Scottish Tories tweeted: ldquoLabour are willing to cave-in to the SNPs demands for #IndyRef. Scottish Conservatives will always stand up for the decision we took to remain in the United Kingdom."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-debate-divide-remains","story":"A RESURGENT Tory Government now presides over a UK whose politics look battered, fragmented and not fit for purpose. And, while the four constituent parts of the UK voted in very dferent ways last Thursday, for all of them there is no longer a status quo option.Brexit is finally going ahead the UK will leave the European Union on January , . Northern Ireland is set for a dferent, closer relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK and, despite bluster from Boris Johnson, there will be a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea.There will too, post-transition, be new friction at Britainrsquos borders with the EU. Outside the customs union and single market, there cannot be an open, frictionless UK-EU border. AndScotland chooses independence in the EU in the coming years, the external border of the EU will then lie between England and Scotland ndash one big issue needing much more debate.Yet Scotland too has no status quo to settle within ndash staying in the UK and in the EU is not an option. Indeed, independence is the only obvious route to staying in or, more likely, rejoining the EU.Meanwhile in Wales, despite voting Leave in , last Thursday pro-Remain or pro-referendum parties got around  per cent of the result . Even in England, the only one of the UKrsquos four nations where the Tories came first in vote share, support for Leave versus Remain referendum parties was neck and neck.Other isions abound. But the demographic ides are one of the most striking. According to Lord Ashcroftrsquos post-election poll, Labour beat the Tories in all the under- year old voting groups. Labour got more than  per cent of the vote in the - group while the Tories got an absolute majorityin the over- group. The idea, promoted by many Corbynistas, that Labour would have done better to fish with the Tories in the Leave half of the UKrsquos population looks bizarre indeed.And though both the election results and polls for the last two years suggest a small Remain majority across the UK, Brexit will now happen. The debate is over but the ide remains.We know too in Scotland that young people are both the most pro-EU and the most pro-independence. And polls, in the last year, have found majorities for independenceBrexit happens. New polls in the coming weeks will be closely watched to seethat sht on the independence question now does show up. If it does, that will add fuel to the Scottish Governmentrsquos current demand for a second independence referendum.But in the weeks, months and years ahead, Britainnow faces a Tory hard Brexit, driven by the combined forces of a populist Tory majority in England, by an English and Welsh Leave vote in , and by an English identity crisis. Yet England, like the UK, will remain bitterly ided too, with fragmentation likely only to increase in the years ahead.A Tory Brexit led by Boris Johnson has no chance of healing such a UK. Divisions over the EU, deep dferences between young and old, profound changes in the Britain-Northern Ireland relationship, and more deep isions between England and Wales, and between England and Scotland, are a recipe for an unsettled, unstable politics ahead. The UK will leave the EU. But its own future path is shrouded in uncertainty.Kirsty Hughes is Director of the Scottish Centre on European Relations"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10792049.jpg?type=article-full","title":"neil-mackay-englands-voice-heard-now-scotlands-turn","story":"English nationalism has got its way. Brexit is coming, and Boris Johnson is in Number . The triumph of English nationalism at the General Election is a great threat to Scotland, and will cost us dearwe do not resist it with every democratic means at our disposal.Not only does Scotland have to face being ripped from the European Union against the will of the nation, but we also have the injustice of Westminster silencing the democratic voice of the Scottish people.The SNP won an astonishing majority of seats at the election. It fought a campaign which hammered home that the nation was lied to at the last independence referendum ndash that we were misled when we were told a No vote was the only way to preserve EU membership. After the EU referendum, circumstances obviously changed and a second independence vote was morally justied. The SNP won on this premise ndash yet wersquore told by Johnson therersquoll be no second independence referendum.Brexit alone is grounds enough for a second independence referendum. The SNPrsquos electoral mandate makes the argument unassailable.An election which confirms the democratic will of the English people is being used to deny the democratic will of the Scottish people. Would the English tolerate such abuse  Itrsquos not hyperbole to say the treatment of Scotland in the first few days of the new Johnson administration smells of tyranny and bodes ill for the future. Itrsquos a clear-cut case of political injustice.This treatment is designed to provoke anger. The Yes movement needs to resist being needled into intemperate behaviour. Already, some voices on the fringes of the Yes movement, or within the SNPrsquos more hysterical base, have began talking of action like a unilateral declaration of independence.Such language is not welcome. The reason the SNP did so well in this election is that the broader Yes movement followed a policy of moderation over the last four years. The leadership wisely avoided the flag-waving, old-school nationalist marches of outfits like All Under One Banner, which seems to attract more than its fair share of cranks and zealots.:Yes vote would be more disruptive after Brexit than in \"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Ian Blackford: Not a good look for Boris Johnson to ignore second Scottish independence referendum calls\",\"description\": \"Ian Blackford: Not a good look for Boris Johnson to ignore second Scottish independence referendum calls\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media ncqRYhbm poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests ncqRYhbm.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Leaders of the SNP and the Yes movement chose to focus on a policy of wooing undecided Scottish voters and soft No voters. It was emollient, open, nuanced, intelligent and unaggressive.The tactic seemed to represent the split in the SNP and the Yes movement mirrored by the personalities of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. Those of a populist persuasion still pine for the bluster of a man like Salmond. This is the brittle SNP base, represented by the online, angry fringe. They achieved nothing in this election. They won over not a single voter. Itrsquos likely thatthey didnrsquot exist at all, the SNPrsquos majority would be even higher than it is today.What secured the SNP electoral victory was the careful, modulated, well-mannered message put out by the leadership. Nicola Sturgeon may have briefly lost her usual dignied composure when she jumped for joy at the sight of Jo Swinsonrsquos defeat on election night politics is played to be won after all but the consistent message throughout the campaign was measured, unthreatening and reassuring.As a result, soft unionists and undecided voters have leant their support to the SNP in order to register opposition to Brexit and Johnsonrsquos hard-right politics. Thatrsquos an act of great trust and they should be applauded for their political bravery. They mustnrsquot be betrayed. Theyrsquove taken the first step on a new journey and must be encouraged towards full support of independence.The policy of moderation has also left the Scottish Labour Party seemingly on the verge of rethinking its entire position on the constitution. Along with continually pressing for moderation among the Yes movement, Irsquove also spoken in this column of the need for Labour to moderate its position on Scottish independence. Today, senior Labour figures are now in favour of a second referendum.The SNP and the Yes movement now sit securely atop the moral high ground. The battle was fought with decency and it paid off. Meanwhile, Johnson and his government treat Scotland with contempt yet we cannot allow understandable anger to undermine that moral high ground.My first emotional reaction to Johnsonrsquos denial of a second referendum was anger. Not only did I feel Scotland was now a hostage to his government ndash hijacked and taken in the boot of his car to Brexitland ndash but the hypocrisy was astonishing. England can get its way, but not Scotland ndash that was the message. Democracy for England do as yoursquore told for Scotland.Nicola Sturgeon at the Glasgow count during the General Election  :Mark Smith: Inside the minds of the unionists who voted SNP ndash and what it means for For a few hours I felt the only answer was to call another referendum whether Westminster liked it or not. But some calm reflection proved just what folly that would be. All the hard work of moderation and measure would be for nothingwe allow ourselves to be riled and act emotionally. Letrsquos avoid the road to Catalonia.The Yes movement must continue the policy of moderation here at home ndash in order to maintain momentum and trust ndash but when Scotland directs its face to Johnson in London there must be only implacable resistance and demand. If Johnson intends to harm Scotland by preventing our voice being heard, then harm him back. Obstruct his government in any way possible. Take his government to courtneeds be to secure a second referendum.Conservative hostility, however, means itrsquos highly unlikely that wersquoll see another referendum until after the next Holyrood election ndash theyrsquoll ly deny any mandate exists until success in  makes such fiction no longer sustainable.What matters most is sustaining that intelligent and dignied composure at home, while never relenting when it comes to fighting the hypocrisy and abuse of democracy emanating from London.

It means less energy and less space is needed to treat a higher quantity of waste water, reducing the operating costs of the site. It also removes the need to chemically treat the effluent, increasing the protection of the rivers Don and Urie, and provides the capacity to support the local community as it continues to grow and flourish. The project was delivered by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD and included building new sewer pipework, improving the resilience of the site to flooding and upgrading existing equipment. Ms Gougeon said: “While treating waste water isn’t something people probably like to think about too often, it is something that is absolutely vital to protect not only our health and sanitation, but also the environment. “Developing new, more efficient ways of treating waste water through the deployment of new technology, is hugely important as Scotland takes decisive steps towards tackling the climate emergency we are facing around the world.” Chief Executive of Scottish Water Douglas Millican said: “We are always looking for ways to innovate and protect the environment both locally and globally, so it is very exciting to see this new state-of-the-art treatment works officially opened here in Inverurie – the first of its kind in Scotland. “Not only does it mean we can continue to treat waste water effectively and protect the environment for years to come, it also underlines our commitment to pursue new ways to lower our energy requirements, towards reaching our ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions by .” Most construction work on site was completed in the Spring and the new treatment process has since been closely monitored during commissioning and beyond.While most of the work took place within the established Scottish Water site, installation of new pipework beneath the railway line involved a closure to Keithhall Road which was completed ahead of schedule in April .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A group of Logie Durno Primary School pupils taking part in the Wee Sleep Out\"  Wee Sleep Out at Logie Durno School viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"ESD Chief Operating Officer Wendy Cooper said: “We are very proud of what has been achieved at Inverurie, successfully delivering a cutting edge new wastewater treatment technology in Scotland for the first time. “Success in this project has involved close collaboration between Scottish Water, ESD, Royal HaskoningDHV and our wider supply chain.

Those talks are critical to the future of our industry.“It is these negotiations that will be the real bread and butter of Brexit for NFU Scotland members. That is where the terms of the trade deal between the UK and the EU will be agreed.“For NFUS, ensuring as free and as frictionless trade in agri-food goods with the EU, which remains our principal market outside of the UK, has been our priority from the start of this process.“Whether negotiating with the EU, or establishing new trade deals with other countries worldwide, a red line for us is that Scotland’s high standards must be recognised and protected.“Our members can be reassured that their union has begun engagement with this new parliament today and we will make tracks to Westminster at the earliest opportunity as we enter a new era for Scottish farming and crofting.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But as well as being a simple, fun song to sing aloud, one of the world’s most ubiquitous nursery rhymes can be used to help promote hygiene among children.Frere Jacques, known in English as Brother Jone, is a helpful tool to encourage youngsters to wash their hands, according to researchers. The simple ditty, which was coined in the th century, tells the story of a snoozy Dominican friar who overslept and forgot to get up to ring the Matins bell. However, its basic melody and phrase structures formed the ideal template to create a song designed to help children stay clean, the Canadian researchers found. . The team, from the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, and the city’s Montessori School, developed the song after realising nothing similar was available.They then tested it out on children to check they understood it and found it fun.For the song, children follow six steps to the tune of Frere Jacques.In step one, children replace the lyrics “Are you sleeping ” with “Scrub your palms”. In step two, “Are you sleeping ” is replaced with “Between the fingers”. In step three, children replace “Brother John, Brother John”, with “Wash the back , wash the back ”.And in step four, the words “Morning bells are ringing” are changed to “Twirl the tipsaround ”.For step five, the words “Morning bells are ringing” are replaced with “Scrub them upside down”.In step six, “Ding, ding, dong ding, ding, dong” is changed to “Thumb attack , thumb attack .”Writing in the British Medical Journal , the researchers said: “Using songs, in particular musical mnemonics based on popular nursery rhymes, may help children learn the process of hand hygiene techniques by making it more fun, thereby increasing attention and the development of memory and motor co-ordination.“We showed that a musical mnemonic developed for pre-school and school-aged children can teach the World Health Organisation hand hygiene technique effectively, potentially reducing infection transmission, with a duration of approximately  seconds.”Such is the influence of Frere Jacques on global musical culture, it has been used as a political tool in spite, or perhaps because of, its childish simplicity. As well as being sung by countless protest groups over the years, there was a famous rendition of the song in  when Jacques Delore, the president of the European Commission, was given a standing ovation by British trade union leaders. A version of the song also appears prominently in Gustav Mahler’s acclaimed First Symphony, which saw the composer transform the original gleeful, upbeat tune into a sombre minor-key funeral march.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"general election why snp and tories should seek a compromise leader comment","story":"The Conservatives and SNP seem set for a fight over Scottish independence that would be in no one#s interest # including their own.It’s not often a general election produces two big ‘winners’ – that’s not really supposed to happen.But this general election saw Boris Johnson lead the Conservatives to their biggest win since  in the heady days of Margaret Thatcher. Meanwhile in Scotland, the SNP’s result was arguably even more remarkable with the party securing  out of  seats. Not quite , but still that means  per cent of Scotland’s MPs are Nationalists.However, their result was achieved on the basis of  per cent of the vote in Scotland and the Tories won . across the UK, so both these ‘majorities’ are actually based on ‘minorities’ and a product of the first-past-the-post system.Amid their understandably triumphant celebrations, Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon now appear to be on a political collision course over a second independence referendum, a bitter and isive constitutional clash of epic proportions.: Jackson Carlaw promises Scottish unionists: We can still stop indyref: Nicola Sturgeon: Indyref is ‘democratic right of the Scottish people’However, they could attempt to take a dferent course, one of humility and respect for the dferent viewpoints of these two political tribes.As he ed to  Downing Street, Boris Johnson said the UK “deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics”, adding: “I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin.”And he is right about the need for healing. The UK is still ided along Leave Remain lines while, for all Johnson and fellow unionists might wish it to be so, the large number of people who support Scottish independence are unlikely to simply give up. And there are other signicant ides in the UK – between left and right, with newly enthused activists on both sides of the spectrum young and old urban and rural areas north and south – that are problems for our society.Rule by London diktatThe key questions are whether Johnson is serious about trying to heal the country or whether this is rhetoric in preparation for the looming fight with the SNP andSturgeon actually has an interest in joining in such a process, rather than stoking ision as part of efforts to secure independence.ButScotland does ever leave the UK, it is most assuredly in its interests to maintain good relations with its nearest and dearest neighbour, just as it is in the UK’s interests to maintain good relations with the EU. Indeed, this would almost certainly be vital to making a success of an independent Scotland. So it would be a mistake for the SNP to dismiss Johnson’s victory and his pledge to stop a second referendum. Political promises should be hard to break, particularly for a Prime Minister with a reputation for being, perhaps, too ‘economical with the actualité’.And, likewise, it would be a mistake for Johnson to add to the sense of nationalist grievance by acting in a high-handed way that could be portrayed as rule by London diktat.They may not like it, in fact, they may absolutely hate it, but they might be better advised to seek some form of compromise, to find an acceptable middle ground.Quite what that would be is hard to say. But it could be more powers for Scotland or perhaps an agreement to allow a second indyrefthe SNP wins the next Holyrood election. Some commentators believe it would be politically untenable to deny a second voteSturgeon wins in that is the case, it might make more sense for Johnson to allow it and focus on ensuring an SNP defeat, rather than rail against it, only to later concede.Smart politics is not always about being tough.

He asserts a mandate to take the whole of the UK, including Scotland, out of the EU, on a lower share of seats and votes then the SNP won in Scotland.“We are facing a Conservative government which Scotland did not vote for and which presents a real danger to our country.“The Scottish Parliament has a duty to protect the values that people in Scotland voted for.  I believe we can only fully do that with independence, and that is why later this week, I will take the next steps to secure Scotland’s right to choose.”Ms Sturgeon’s reference to the  result is calculated to reach older Labour supporters who will recall an election that Neil Kinnock’s party was widely expected to win - only to see John Major’s Conservatives ed with a majority. Labour won  of  possible seats, with many of its MPs actively supporting an on-going campaign for the creation of a Scottish parliament.It was far removed from the catastrophic defeat Jeremy Corbyn’s party endured at last week’s election, where it was reduced to a single MP in Scotland.Writing in The Scotsman today, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the result had “sent a strong message to Labour and it would be a grave mistake not to listen”.He continued: “It is my view that instead of expecting the people of Scotland to come home to Labour, Scottish Labour must instead come home to them. “On the doorstep, it was clear that many voters liked and supported our manesto, which is in line with what opinion polling has consistently suggested, but frankly doubted whether we could be trusted to implement it.”He added: “It is clear that  years on from devolution the British state is too centralised and there are real imbalances of power in the economy too. In our manesto, we promised to set up a Constitutional Convention to decentralise power. “Learning the lessons from the Scottish Constitutional Convention, we now should establish a Constitution Convention in opposition. This could develop a blueprint which will be ready to legislate for and implement in Government. And we should be prepared to work on this with other parties and organisationsand where this is possible.”Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: “Scotland already has the right to choose and we chose to remain in the UK.“The majority of people of Scotland also chose pro-UK parties at last week’s General Election.“And barely a quarter of Scots would choose to hold a isive second independence referendum next year, according to polls.“Scotland deserves better than a government obsessed with creating ision between families and friends.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Good, reliable and accessible transport links are of vital importance to our communities,# said Ms Wishart.“From the delivery of the air discount scheme to securing funding in the Scottish Government budget for internal ferry services and leading the campaign for cheaper ferry fares, I am proud of the Liberal Democrat record. In stark contrast, the SNP have failed to deliver on their promises and introduced parking charges at Sumburgh.“It is totally unacceptable for SNP ministers to hold our leline services at ransom. We need a change, and my five-point plan sets out a positive alternative for Shetland that would make the real dference that local people deserve.“As a matter of good faith, SNP ministers should listen to local demands and take all the money they have failed to spend on cheaper ferry fares over the last  months and recycle it into Shetland services. To choose not to would speak volumes about their priorities.”Responding to Ms Wishart#s comments, SNP candidate Tom Wills said: “Voters may remember the -point plan to slash travel costs that I published a week and a half ago. The dference between my plan, and what the Lib Dems have published today, is that I’ll be working with the Scottish Government to implement my proposals # instead of making demands from the side-lines while refusing to take part in budget talks.“I’ve already taken the opportunity to push these plans with government ministers and it’s clear they are ready for fresh ideas to support these islands.“The SNP has delivered a % discount on flights and nearly £ million for mainland ferries since . The money SIC receives to run these services has historically been determined by the local government distribution formula # this was the case when the Lib Dems were in office. For each of the last two years the SNP has provided an extra £m of funding for internal services.“The Scottish Government is also committed to implementing an RET-equivalent that includes cabin costs on the Aberdeen route but we have been prevented from doing so by the Pentland Ferries complaint.“Baseless accusations that the SNP has held Shetland to ransom are part and parcel of the Lib Dems negative narrative that only holds us back. It’s time for a change of tone in this debate. I know there’s more to do, but rather than assuming bad faith, let me prove what we can achieve when we work together.”Another by-election candidate, Ryan Thomson took to Facebook to express his views on the Lib Dem plan.The Lib Dems can promise as much as they like, but when it comes to delivery, they never do.  years as Tory lap- dogs with Carmichael as a lap- dog Secretary of State brought increased poverty to Shetland, not improvements in transportrelayed costs.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense.

Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg.

You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Back in  he represented the area as mayor, later becoming its MLA.Twelve years later he is now the constituencys MP - a triumph for Alliance which few political pundits would have been comfortable betting their money on until yesterday, with most predicting the seat was there for the DUPs taking.Dr Farrys Westminster win is no mean feat - voters held his successor, the independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon, in huge affection. Like Lady Hermon, he is a firm Remainer, and during his campaign he was keen to stress their shared Brexit position.A Queens University graduate in Politics with a PhD in International Relations, Dr Farry is only the second Alliance politician to be elected to Westminster in its history.A fitting development, perhaps, given the Newtownards man is arguably Alliances second most high-profile name, behind leader Naomi Long.During his tenure in the Executive, he served as minister for employment and learning, and gained widespread praise for capping tuition fees in September . Following the  Assembly elections, he took up positions on the Stormont Committee for the Economy and Business Committee, positions he held until the collapse of power-sharing in .His political work has also garnered global attention: in  he was appointed an International Peace Scholar by the US Institute of Peace. The -year-old has always been a passionate advocate of Alliances cross-community ethos, but he himself has been caught in the crossfire of Northern Irelands green and orange politics.In , after fellow party members on Belfast City Council voted in favour of restricting the flying of the Union flag at City Hall to specic days throughout the year, his own constituency office in Bangor was the target of an attempted arson attack. But with Alliances gains in this latest election, Dr Farry will be hoping it indicates potential for growing the middle ground in local politics. *Stephen Farry was not available for an interview yesterday.Stephen FarryAllianceNorth DownWon by: , votesBrexit: Remain"},{"url":null,"title":"ofcom proposes ban on mobile firms selling locked phones","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Our new rules would free you from those frustrations so you can unlock a better deal: https:t.co FYIOTSAF pic ecRTKQYU— OfcomDecember , “By freeing mobile users from locked handsets, our plans would save people time, effort and money – and help them unlock a better deal.”The proposals have been welcomed by industry experts.Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at uSwitch, said: “This latest round of Ofcom proposals on selling unlocked handsets is great news for consumers.“Smartphones can cost in excess of £,, so expecting people to fork out that sum of cash for a restricted device feels incredibly outdated.“Changing network is getting easier and easier thanks to rules such as text-to-switch and the introduction of end-of-contract notications coming in February next year.“We also welcome Ofcom’s plans to improve the experience of switching broadband providers. As more new fibre networks start offering services to consumers, it’s vital that switching processes keep up with the increased choice.“Ensuring that switches are always done automatically, and are smoothly coordinated by the new company, will help ensure that people are not put off moving to better services.“However, the devil is in the detail and we need to see exactly how industry translates these proposed new principles into a switching system that really works for consumers."},{"url":null,"title":"animals enjoy christmas treats at london zoo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But in terms of other issues facing the city, Mr Eastwood said he will argue for “properly directed investment” in the city that will require a Stormont government.“We have been failed by people who have run the government here for too long and it’s time to get that fixed,” he said.Voters in the North, and in Scotland, rejected Boris Johnson but he did express disappointment at the overall result which secured a large majority for the Conservative party.“In politics you have to play the ball where it lies, we did our bit, others didn’t, but we have to find a way of protecting ourselves.”Talks are set to resume at Stormont and the Derry man suggested he is prepared to go into oppositionthe city’s interests are cast aside.“After the last Assembly election there was a change because of the Fresh Start Agreement which meant you had to have a negotiation and a programme for government. We went into that negotiation determined to get Magee expanded, more social houses built and a few other things, and they weren’t asks that should’ve been hard to deliver.“The DUP and Sinn Feacutein refused to even negotiate with us on that basis so we said well see you we’ll go into opposition to try to argue for those things from that position.“They know thatthey want an all-inclusive government then they have to look after the people of Derry first.” googletag.cmd.push ‘Fight’ The SDLP leader said he knew the party was doing well during canvassing but didn’t think he would win by such a large margin, billed as a “tight fight”, that’s the way they treated it.On Friday Mr Eastwood entered a room above the Pickled Duck cafeacute along with his we, Rachael, and daughters to applause from his party members and supporters.He began by thanking his team. “A couple of years ago when we lost this seat, we didn’t fold up the tent, we didn’t walk away quietly. We became very determined that this city’s representation, not just for us, not at all for us in fact, but for the people of Derry.“I think we’ve been starved over the last couple of years of representation, I wish we had MPs when they were very tight votes on Brexit. But we have a fight on our hands now and we have to fight against Boris Johnson who now has a Tory majority, he will do all sorts of negative things for the people of this city and we have to be there, not just speaking but voting against him and taking the fight to this new Tory government. “And I pledge on behalf of the people in this room and the people of Derry to take that fight right to the heart of Westminster.He continued: “We heard very loudly on the doors what people wanted, they wanted representation at Westminster and their voice heard but they also wanted government in Stormont and people to deal with the crisis in our health service. They don’t think it’s good enough for people to stand on picket lines and then not go to work the next day to try to sort out the problems faced by our low-paid health workers.”He also highlighted teachers who are having to bring the most basic resources to school because there is no education budget.“People in this city know the old story of Derry, that generations of our people leave here and don’t come home because there aren’t enough jobs, because previous Executives haven’t invested in our university to attract and keep those jobs. That’s the work that we have to be engaged in now, we don’t take one vote we got for granted, we know the work that we have to be about and that work starts on Monday morning.“This party is very grateful for the huge endorsement that we’ve got, but we know it’s not about us, we know it’s about the people of Derry roaring a message to politicians that ‘it’s time to get on with the job’. And we’re very grateful for people from right across the political ide for coming and rallying behind us and I just want to say to them, we won’t let you down.” googletag.cmd.push Stormont Mr Eastwood will attend Westminster tomorrow. Making reference to other results across the North, he said it is about people “raising their voices against Brexit and for a sensible accommodation to bring people back together again.”The Secretary of State for NI Julian Smith knows “we have to get back around the table urgently…we heard it loudly and clearly, let’s get back to work,” he added.“Everybody in this room either is on a waiting list or knows someone who’s on one. It’s a terrible inditement of our politics and it’s time we fixed it. Everybody in this room has had a member of their family, or many members, leave this city because they just can’t make ends meet being here, that’s a terrible inditement of our politics. “Everybody in this room knows what has to happen, we have to take responsibility, we have to take power in our hands to deal with the problems faced by our voters. No longer is it good enough to stand on the side lines, no longer is it good enough to look in the window, we have to be in there, that’s what people want us to do, that doesn’t just mean Westminster that means Stormont as well so let’s get on with it.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He attended St. Peters from  - and left with one O Level in English. This week he was awarded a PhD for a thesis assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes. In the midst of the Troubles it was a dficult time for young people to focus on their studies.Maurice said: “For me, leaving school with one O Level and thinking I was stupid, to get into such a prestigious course and successfully completing it is a proud moment.”The Derry man is proof that le is about learning as despite leaving school with few qualications he immersed himself in study and has used it to help others through decades of social and community work.After spending some time on the dole, at -years-old Maurice began voluntary work as a youth worker and enrolled in an Addiction Studies course at Ulster University Magee.This coincided with work at Northlands Addiction Treatment Centre. Maurice believes alcohol was, and still is, the single biggest issue facing Derry. “The problem is that people don’t even view it as a drug, but it’s more powerful than most and one of the few drugs that actually damages the body just by taking it.”The heavy binge drinking culture that exists in Ireland is the source of many social ills, he said. “The main reason children are taken into care, neglect, is often down to parents having a drink problem.” googletag.cmd.push Treatment projects In January  he moved to London to work in a residential alcohol treatment project where he attained a diploma in alcohol counselling at the University of Kent. The following year he got a job as manager at the alcohol treatment centre, a post he held for four years.When planning toto live in Derry he believed that with a social work qualication he could secure a steady job and therefore applied for the professional social work training course at the University of Ulster.“The best thing about it was that it gave me an academic qualication and also a professional qualication which would allow me to be employed.“I graduated in  and started working right away with the Foyle Health and Social Services Trust in the Leaving and After Care Team, supporting young people who are leaving care and preparing to live independently in the community.”In  he, and local community worker, Frankie McMenamin, established the local charity, Zest, an organisation providing supportive care and counselling to young people struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm. Maurice managed Zest for  years before leaving to pursue other interests.At the turn of the millennium until  he was part of the first Drug Arrest Referral scheme in Northern Ireland. The scheme was managed by the Western Health and Social Care TrustAlcohol and Dug Service and required daily attendance at the Strand Road Police Station. It was an innovative project through which all persons detained at the police station were offered support to address alcohol and drug problems. googletag.cmd.push PhD studies  In  he was grant aided by the Public Health Agency to undertake a fellowship at Queens University Belfast.His PhD involved “assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes” in Northern Ireland. “A lot of men drop out of these rehabilitation programmes and what research has found is that when these men drop out they actually present as a greater risk to victims compared tothey had never been referred. “Amongst other things, the research established the men who completed the programme stopped drinking before or at the start of the programme, whereas the men who dropped out of the programme had continued to drink alcohol.“Because of the way alcohol affects the brain,you’re not drinking you’re far more alert and your brain can make connections and you can develop insight to understand yourself.“Butyou’re drinking during the week then it slows the brain’s ability to make sense of things.”He is now working to rehabilitate men who have been domestically violent. “We know prison doesn’t work and most of the men never receive the help that they need,” Maurice said. ‘Compassion’ When he ed to the WHSCT from his secondment at Queens University Belfast, Maurice began working as part of the Domestic Violence Team. Here he set up the first group-based and inidualised domestic violence treatment programmes run by the WHSCT. The demands entailed in establishing the new programme meant that it took longer than initially anticipated to finish the PhD.However, this year he successfully completed the PhD which is the culmination of eight and a half years of hard work.Sadly, his parents aren’t alive to share what is a high point on le’s journey but his children and other family members attended the graduation ceremony. “I’m really looking forward to the event, my daughter and son are going with me,” he said.Asked about the lessons he’s learned through his studies and decades of paid and voluntary work, he said: “No matter what sort of problems a person has, human beings have a massive capacity to change but you have to have the right support and help, which has to be provided in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.“You can condemn behaviour, but not the person. You have to believe in the persons inherent worth and in their ability to bring about the change they need. Change is possible but people need the right support network in place.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He attended St. Peters from  - and left with one O Level in English. This week he was awarded a PhD for a thesis assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes. In the midst of the Troubles it was a dficult time for young people to focus on their studies.Maurice said: “For me, leaving school with one O Level and thinking I was stupid, to get into such a prestigious course and successfully completing it is a proud moment.”The Derry man is proof that le is about learning as despite leaving school with few qualications he immersed himself in study and has used it to help others through decades of social and community work.After spending some time on the dole, at -years-old Maurice began voluntary work as a youth worker and enrolled in an Addiction Studies course at Ulster University Magee.This coincided with work at Northlands Addiction Treatment Centre. Maurice believes alcohol was, and still is, the single biggest issue facing Derry. “The problem is that people don’t even view it as a drug, but it’s more powerful than most and one of the few drugs that actually damages the body just by taking it.”The heavy binge drinking culture that exists in Ireland is the source of many social ills, he said. “The main reason children are taken into care, neglect, is often down to parents having a drink problem.” googletag.cmd.push Treatment projects In January  he moved to London to work in a residential alcohol treatment project where he attained a diploma in alcohol counselling at the University of Kent. The following year he got a job as manager at the alcohol treatment centre, a post he held for four years.When planning toto live in Derry he believed that with a social work qualication he could secure a steady job and therefore applied for the professional social work training course at the University of Ulster.“The best thing about it was that it gave me an academic qualication and also a professional qualication which would allow me to be employed.“I graduated in  and started working right away with the Foyle Health and Social Services Trust in the Leaving and After Care Team, supporting young people who are leaving care and preparing to live independently in the community.”In  he, and local community worker, Frankie McMenamin, established the local charity, Zest, an organisation providing supportive care and counselling to young people struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm. Maurice managed Zest for  years before leaving to pursue other interests.At the turn of the millennium until  he was part of the first Drug Arrest Referral scheme in Northern Ireland. The scheme was managed by the Western Health and Social Care TrustAlcohol and Dug Service and required daily attendance at the Strand Road Police Station. It was an innovative project through which all persons detained at the police station were offered support to address alcohol and drug problems. googletag.cmd.push PhD studies  In  he was grant aided by the Public Health Agency to undertake a fellowship at Queens University Belfast.His PhD involved “assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes” in Northern Ireland. “A lot of men drop out of these rehabilitation programmes and what research has found is that when these men drop out they actually present as a greater risk to victims compared tothey had never been referred. “Amongst other things, the research established the men who completed the programme stopped drinking before or at the start of the programme, whereas the men who dropped out of the programme had continued to drink alcohol.“Because of the way alcohol affects the brain,you’re not drinking you’re far more alert and your brain can make connections and you can develop insight to understand yourself.“Butyou’re drinking during the week then it slows the brain’s ability to make sense of things.”He is now working to rehabilitate men who have been domestically violent. “We know prison doesn’t work and most of the men never receive the help that they need,” Maurice said. ‘Compassion’ When he ed to the WHSCT from his secondment at Queens University Belfast, Maurice began working as part of the Domestic Violence Team. Here he set up the first group-based and inidualised domestic violence treatment programmes run by the WHSCT. The demands entailed in establishing the new programme meant that it took longer than initially anticipated to finish the PhD.However, this year he successfully completed the PhD which is the culmination of eight and a half years of hard work.Sadly, his parents aren’t alive to share what is a high point on le’s journey but his children and other family members attended the graduation ceremony. “I’m really looking forward to the event, my daughter and son are going with me,” he said.Asked about the lessons he’s learned through his studies and decades of paid and voluntary work, he said: “No matter what sort of problems a person has, human beings have a massive capacity to change but you have to have the right support and help, which has to be provided in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.“You can condemn behaviour, but not the person. You have to believe in the persons inherent worth and in their ability to bring about the change they need. Change is possible but people need the right support network in place.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The union has said that on completion of the period of industrial action they will develop a plan for further industrial action up to and including March , . NIPSA has said that the current action is necessary because, despite numerous meetings, the employers, the Department of Health and the Government have failed to sufficiently address NIPSA’s claims for pay justice and safe staffing. They added that they will also continue to consult with the other unions to discuss further co-ordination despite having dferent objectives and tactics in the ongoing dispute.Calling on all members to attend picket lines, a statement added: NIPSA has not agreed any exemptions from the industrial action. If the employers identy real emergency situations, they will be able to contact NIPSA’s liaison officers and appropriate arrangements will be put in place. In any incident where strikers carry out agreed emergency cover, NIPSA will view them as acting on behalf of the striking workforce and will expect them to relinquish their wages for the period of the cover.NIPSA Deputy General Secretary Padraig Mullholland said: “The strike on December  will be hard-hitting but our members have no choice but to defend our National Health Service, for too long members have held together a system that is in crisis so that our communities get a decent service.”Meanwhile, Assistant Secretary Maria Morgan added: “Safe staffing and pay justice are at the heart of our dispute, our members have had enough and have made it clear that action is now necessary.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The news has had an huge impact on players and clubs across the Irish League and beyond and Cltonville manager McLaughlin admitted Thompsons death is a huge loss to everyone in football.  The recent death of Jerry Thompson has shocked fotoball. googletag.cmd.push “I only knew him as an opponent but he was one of those players you would always be looking out for in the other team because he had that bit of quality that youd be worried about,” he said. “Its sad for his family and its sad for football and my thoughts and prayers go out to his family, his team mates and also his friends. Its devastating to have this to deal with but sadly its all too common in Northern Ireland at the minute.”The nature of Thompsons death, particularly for someone so young, has resumed the conversation about the importance of mental health and McLaughlin agreed that todays youth are often fighting battles that few realise.“Its a stark reminder of young players and what they have to deal with these days in terms of social media and the pressures of le,” he continued.“Some of them take on the pressures of the world and it doesnt have to be like that because there are people out there who can help. Theres probably not enough help on hand for young people in general, not just footballers so I think we should all be looking into that a lot more. I dont think theres enough done about it in general, but at club level I think every club should be looking into it. I think every club should have someone on board who young players can come and speak to about anything at all.“To be fair to Cltonville and I know a lot of clubs are the same, they have a club chaplain on board and ours is there every training session and there every game. Hes there to speak to anyone about anything at all, good and bad, and its good to have that about. “Maybe clubs should be looking to have professional help on site at all times for young players because the pressures of le do get to them a lot and they have so much to deal with so perhaps clubs should look into that.”The loss of Thompson will be keenly felt in footballing circles for some time to come and McLaughlin emphasised the importance of remembering his legacy.“It would scare you,” he admitted. “It would scare you thinking about how the mind works and how young people think. Jerry had a young family, and he was a hard-working young man and he was playing in the Irish League and people would probably look and say he has everything he needs, but people dont know what goes on in others minds and what theyre dealing with behind closed doors. “This would probably scare a lot of players into seeking help andthere is any good to come from it, hopefully it does encourage people to seek professional help and be more open with their problems.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The news has had an huge impact on players and clubs across the Irish League and beyond and Cltonville manager McLaughlin admitted Thompsons death is a huge loss to everyone in football.  The recent death of Jerry Thompson has shocked fotoball. googletag.cmd.push “I only knew him as an opponent but he was one of those players you would always be looking out for in the other team because he had that bit of quality that youd be worried about,” he said. “Its sad for his family and its sad for football and my thoughts and prayers go out to his family, his team mates and also his friends. Its devastating to have this to deal with but sadly its all too common in Northern Ireland at the minute.”The nature of Thompsons death, particularly for someone so young, has resumed the conversation about the importance of mental health and McLaughlin agreed that todays youth are often fighting battles that few realise.“Its a stark reminder of young players and what they have to deal with these days in terms of social media and the pressures of le,” he continued.“Some of them take on the pressures of the world and it doesnt have to be like that because there are people out there who can help. Theres probably not enough help on hand for young people in general, not just footballers so I think we should all be looking into that a lot more. I dont think theres enough done about it in general, but at club level I think every club should be looking into it. I think every club should have someone on board who young players can come and speak to about anything at all.“To be fair to Cltonville and I know a lot of clubs are the same, they have a club chaplain on board and ours is there every training session and there every game. Hes there to speak to anyone about anything at all, good and bad, and its good to have that about. “Maybe clubs should be looking to have professional help on site at all times for young players because the pressures of le do get to them a lot and they have so much to deal with so perhaps clubs should look into that.”The loss of Thompson will be keenly felt in footballing circles for some time to come and McLaughlin emphasised the importance of remembering his legacy.“It would scare you,” he admitted. “It would scare you thinking about how the mind works and how young people think. Jerry had a young family, and he was a hard-working young man and he was playing in the Irish League and people would probably look and say he has everything he needs, but people dont know what goes on in others minds and what theyre dealing with behind closed doors. “This would probably scare a lot of players into seeking help andthere is any good to come from it, hopefully it does encourage people to seek professional help and be more open with their problems.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An economist is also helping compile the document.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local authorities paired with Belfast City Council, universities and theprivate sector who have

the councilrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee, politicians were told that officials have been working on the detailed outline business case since last May, with a consultancy team helping prepare the document.Council officials say that when work on the business case is completed next spring, it will provide a detailed analysis and assessment of the projectrsquos strategic fit within the City Deal.In addition, the document will also outline detailed project costs, the benefits, risks and funding requirements.Politicians were told this week that the documentrsquos analysis will recommend a particular procurement route in order to deliver the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the ongoing development of the business case involves planning considerations and the development of exemplar design and output specications, prior to any formal procurement exercise being undertaken.Politicians were informed on Monday night that the outline business case will provide detail on the technical expertise in terms of the design, construction and maintenance of similar international attractions and also provide detailed analysis of commercial operations of a visitor attraction of this scale.It is understood that council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.Other aspects of the Mournes Gateway scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes, with a so-called green travel network which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have

Someone came forward and this was welcomed by elderly people who would not be forced to travel outside the town to access services.Cllr Walker says it is vital that Ballynahinch retains its dedicated postal office and appealed to someone the townrsquos business community to consider taking over the service.ldquoBallynahinch is Down Districtrsquos third largest town and it would be a body blowthe planned temporary closure became permanent, he said.ldquoThe bottom lines appears to be thatno one comes forward to offer to run the service it will close and that will impact on people across the community.ldquoThe role of local post offices has changed considerably over recent years, with many transferring to large supermarkets which ensured that they were open for much longer, including weekends.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices, not banks. That is one of the many reasons why this vitally important service is not lost to Ballynahinch. A number of local post offices, which provide a much broader range of services including banking facilities, are now housed in retail premises.Cllr Walker added: ldquoIt is my hope that one of the major retailers in Ballynahinch will come forward to ensure that the service is not lost to the town.

And while there is a signicant financial benefit for securing geopark status, council officials insist the benefits are not just economic.They have previously argued that geoparks have a ldquosignicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.Currently, there are three designated geoparks in Ireland. In addition to the Marble Arch Caves in Fermanagh, they include The Burren and Clfs of Moher in Co Clare and the Copper Coast geopark in Co Waterford.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed on Monday afternoon that the local authorityrsquos bid for geopark was formally submitted last month..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Publication.jpg","title":"Book delves into the history around Strangford  ","story":"INVERBRENA Local History Group has launched the latest edition of its annual magazine mdash just in time for Christmas.Memories From Inverbrena: Strangford  features a selection of memories, stories, histories and photographs of people and places within the Strangford area, preserved for future generations.The magazine includes an article by Michael McConville in which he chronicles the history of the the local parish drama club during the s and s, including a selection of photographs of local amateur actors and actresses who participated in some of the popular well received productions.In his second article in this yearrsquos publication, Michael remembers happy days potato picking, recalling how everyone worked together as a team, both boys and girls, and all getting the same pay at the end of the day.Melanie Hamill puts pen to paper to provide an invaluable record of her splendid conversion of Strangford Presbyterian Church, earning it the prestigious  Heritage Angel award for Best Rescue of a Historic Building Or Place for projects under pound million.

These included the non-replacement of clerical staff who resign and y delays in the supply of equipment necessary for class use.Mr Ellis also slammed a proposal to impose a charge for school transport and labelled it as ldquoclearly unfair.He stressed that he was not taking the negative attitude that all cuts are bad.

He was very young and had been badly neglected. He had been kept in a confined space or a very small pen. Sony was very loving. All he wanted was to be loved and he thrived on attention.ldquoHe was a huge dog but very dirty. When we gave him a bath his coat came up lovely and white. We got him started with his first round of vaccinations and our followers stood by us financially.Monica works closely with Corran Kennels, on the Tobercorran Road outside Downpatrick, who come to her for helpthey need a puppy or dog re-homed, and Animal Connexions, based at Nutts Corner outside Belfast.Monica said: ldquoRecently a litter of  kittens were about to be euthanised and we managed to be able to find homes for all of them within a short period of time.Monica added that she has her own account with the two branches of Castle Vets in Downpatrick and Castlewellan and pays for any necessary medical attention abandoned pets may need out of her own pocket.ldquoMembers of the public are so good. When we put up an appeal on the page that an animal requires surgery or medicine they phone the vets and give money and it comes off the bill.ldquoI am so grateful to everyone. It can be tough going and running something like this takes a big chunk out of your le, but our team of volunteers are thankfully very enthusiastic.ldquoAnyone can follow the page. Just ask to join the group through the socialmedia network and followers will be able to keep up-to-date with what we are doing.Lana King, from Burrenreagh, is a volunteer with the not-for-profit organisation.She said: ldquoWhile the main aim of the page back in  originally was to reunite owners with their pets, there are times when nobody comes looking for a little lost one and thatrsquos when Monica goes beyond the call of duty and ensures they have a second chance with a new family.ldquoShe gets to know the potential owner, carries out a home check and follows it up. There is nothing she loves more than to hear how the pets she has helped to re-home or re-habilitate are doing.Lana added: ldquoMonica really is the back bone of Lost Found Pets South Down and has gained the admiration and respect from anyone who comes into contact with her.ldquoNothing is ever too much bother for her.ldquoShe has devoted her le to animals and makes sure every pet that comes to her receives the very best of care.ldquoEven though Monica suffers with a debilitating disease called lupus, she just gets up every morning and gets on with it.ldquoHer sharp wit, sense of humour and contagious laugh lts the spirits of people who are going through the heartbreak of having their pet go missing and reassures them because they know Monica will do everything she can to reunite them with their beloved pet.Lana added: ldquoMonica helps those pets who have found themselves either lost, abandoned, abused or simply not having a loving home to call their own..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Health.jpg","title":"Health workers take  industrial strike action  ","story":"HEALTH workers in Downpatrick took strike action last Friday ahead of a series of protests calling for pay parity and adequate nursing numbers.Nurses were working to rule yesterday and today at the Downshire and Downe Hospitals while a joint strike planned between their union, the Royal College of Nursing , and Unison, will be held next Wednesday.Hospital and outlying district services will be impacted as the strike will run from am until pm mdash unless a deal is done before that.Unison and the RCN are demanding equal pay for its members in line with UK counterparts and for increased nurse recruitment to protect patients in a failing health service.Domestics, porters, catering staff, administrative staff, dental nurses from all wards and departments in the Downe and Downshire Hospitals and outlying facilities will join nurses who have voted to strike for the first time in their -year history.Public support was high for health workers, including nurses from the Down Outpatients Department, who took part in Fridayrsquos strike.Hundreds of Unison members joined the picket in the morning and afternoon at Downshire Hospitalrsquos entrance with local drivers sounding support as they passed.The impact of the action closed the Outpatients department at the Downe Hospital, along with the Ulster Hospital, Lagan Valley, Ards and Bangor Hospitals.The Community Dental Service was impacted with the cancellation of the Ballynahinch clinic and two clinics at Downe Hospital on Friday afternoon.The impact was widespread for patients as day case surgery, ENT and gynaecology at Lagan Valley Hospital was cancelled along with the closure of the Medical Day Case Unit, Dermatology Laser Unit, Cath Lab and Ambulatory Hubs at the Ulster Hospital.The South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust said that that all affected patients had been contacted and would be rescheduled for appointments at a future date.Staff from the Downshire Hospital were strengthened by colleagues from the nearby Downe, who joined the picket.Unison members who work in the transport and domiciliary care went out on strike from am- noon while the rest of the workers came out from pm-pm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and SDLP election candidate Michael Savage showed their support as did SDLP MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and John Trainor.Unison branch secretary Marian Ritchie called on all the elected representatives present to give members more than a show of support.She told cheering strikers: ldquoWe want every politician here now to give a commitment to say, as iniduals and as a group, that every single one of the the health service staff will get a pay rise and pay parity.The call was met with shouts of ldquoGet back to work by the strikers.Ms Ritchie also told her colleagues: ldquoThe Permanent Secretary says that he has the money but not the authority and the only ones that have the authority are the politicians.

McIlhone won the ball off a Ballynagross defender and without even looking up let one fly from  yards out.Goalkeeper Ross Preece was stranded in no manrsquos land and his despairing outstretched attempt to tip the ball over the crossbar failed as the ball nestled in the back of the net.Two minutes later, man of the match Ross Armstrong made it -. He chased a lost cause of a ball into the box where Marron and Preece were favourites to win the race, but Armstrongrsquos sheer desire helped to get him to the ball first and he was able to dink it into an empty net.With  minutes gone Armstrong pounced again to make it - after McIlhone had carved out the opening.Killough continued to bombard Ballynagross with everything and anything, but Ballynagross bravely weathered the storm and gradually started to create chances of their own.With  minutes gone they patiently worked an opening for Ryan McKinney, but he was denied a goal when the impressive Sean Og Burns got back to hack the ball off the line.That was as good as it got for Ballynagross as Killough made it - three minutes later. Gareth George picked the ball up from a Ben McLaughlin throw and immediately set off on one of his trademark, penetrating runs.George had only one thing on his mind after leaving three players for dead and his unerring finish into the bottom corner had Preece clutching at thin air.Six minutes later it was - when Armstrong headed a free back across the box and McIlhone had all the time in the world to send Killough into delirium.With  minutes gone a delightful cross from Adam George was met perfectly by Armstrong and the big striker powered an unstoppable header to the net to make it -.Some of Killoughrsquos play in the first half was breathtaking and few teams could have lived with them and as the players trooped off at half-time, everyone feared for Ballynagross.However, the break gave Campbell the chance to reorganise his troops and the were a dferent proposition in the second half.Marron pulled one back from the spot after Sean Og Burns took down Philip Doran in the box, but despite creating several other chances, that was it for Ballynagross.Eoin Rooney and Conor McCarron had shots well saved by Killough lsquokeeper Eddie Hinc, while Liam Graham headed over at the other end and Preece saved from Gareth George.Killough were a pale shadow of the side that lit up Binnian Park in the first  minutes, but they can be forgiven for taking their foot off the pedal after taking a - lead.Ballynagross can only reflect on what might have been, had they been able to field at full strength, but football can be a cruel game as they found out on Friday night.Killough: Eddie Hinc, Matthew Burns, Ben McLaughlin, Colm Stranney, Sean Og Burns, Matt McKiernan, Gareth George, Adam George, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Riain Burns: Subs: Liam Graham, Seamas Tumelty, Ryan McIlhone, Robbie Hagan, Ruairi Sharvin.Ballynagross: Ross Preece, Deaglan Craig, Tom McNeill, Aaron Beattie, Conor Marron, Conor McCarron, Karl Johnston, Mark Magill, Daniel Taggart, Declan Dowie, Ryan McKinney.

Over the past year, the level of recycled waste has increased by %.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran hopes the work to provide mains power to the new Flying Horse Road facility is completed as soon as possible.ldquoI do not know why there is no mains power but it is a little embarrassing that the CCTV cameras at a poundm centre cannot be operated and we have had to hire in a private security firm, he said.ldquoThis represents an additional cost to already hard-pressed ratepayers and I hope that we are talking about days, not weeks, for the mains power to be supplied. It is an issue council officers need to be on top of.Cllr Curran said that many people were keen to see the new centre opened, given that its predecessor at nearby Cloonagh Road was struggling to cope with the huge demand being placed upon it.He continued: ldquoIt is great to have such a modern recycling facility on our doorstep to meet the needs of people who are clearly recycling their waste in increasing numbers. The new centre is being well used and the council deserves credit for this major investment but, in my opinion, the mains power issue should have been sorted before it opened for business.Cllr Curran said that given the increased emphasis on recycling, the council is behind innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.He added: ldquoA number of groups have expressed an interest in taking part and I have no doubt that this scheme will be a success with ious items destined for the scrapheap given a new lease of le.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the recycling centre was operating without mains power.ldquoIt has taken longer than anticipated to connect the mains power supply at the new site, said the spokeswoman.ldquoAs a temporary measure, a generator and security firm are being used to cover requirements. Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working to have the mains power installed as soon as possible.The Recorder asked the local authority how much it is paying the security firm to police the new civic amenity site outside its normal operating hours but was not provided with an answer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Leitrim.jpg","title":"Sr Bartholomew’s centenary celebrations  ","story":"THE family of a Leitrim nun, who has lived in Africa for  years, flew thousands of miles to help her celebrate her  birthday.Sr Mary Bartholomew was joined by five nieces, including Dympna Kelly and Eileen Ramsey from her home village, who arrived in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, to mark her milestone birthday last week.Another niece, Mary McAleenan, from Slievnaboley, near Leitrim, who wasnrsquot able to make the journey, says her aunt had been on an adventure since she left home in  on board the Warwick Castle to care for ldquothe poorest of the poor amid the soaring heat of South Africa.Sr Bartholmew, was born Philomena Cunningham on December , , and enjoyed growing up with her four sisters and three brothers on what is now known as Kilnhill Road in Leitrim.She and her older sister, Mary Bernadette, who also became a nun, were among the first girls to play camogie in Leitrim before an official team had even been set up by the local Fontenoys GAA club.She was educated at Sacred Heart Grammar School in Newry and with her heart set on a religious vocation she entered the Assumption Convent in Ballynahinch just as World War II began.Her niece, Mary, said that being a nun in those days brought honour to a family and having two daughters as nuns set the Cunninghams apart within their small rural village.ldquoThere were nine other postulants accompanying Sr Bartholomew on the long voyage across to Africa. Her ship was the last passenger ship to sail to the continent for many years, as most ships were then commissioned for the war effort, Mary explained.The young nun swapped the green fields and rain of home for the blistering heat and bustle of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, which must have been quite an experience.She completed her religious formation and academic teacher training before taking her vows in . Over the following decades she taught in several schools. Eventually, on retiring, she was assigned a new mission, opening a clinic and a pre-school within an encampment that catered for over , refugees fleeing the horrors of the Mozambique war.In Sr Bartholomewrsquos own words of this period in her le, recorded in a book written over  years ago, Drumgooland ndash A Parish Divided, she recalls: ldquoWith missionary zeal we did our utmost over the following years to render whatever assistance we could to the many thousands of refugees, I taught including adults.ldquoThese poor people had a minimum of education and were eager to learn English. After class we would sit around and read the bible in Shangaan, the local language, and gave help when it was needed.Niece Mary takes up the story again. She added: ldquoNuns donrsquot retire and while Sr Bartholomew found the intense heat too much after several years, she made for the cooler environment of an office and spent time in general admin.Sr Bartholomew would often make the trip back home to Leitrim after Vatican II came to pass when the rigours and discipline of a pious le became more relaxed in the s. However, she was always looked forward to going back to Port Elizabeth.Her last trip home was some years ago when her older sister, Eileen, was seriously ill.ldquoShe had managed to hold her hand and chat briefly before she passed away, Mary recalled. She stayed until Eileenrsquos months mind,and left shortly after.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That can only mean one thing – the dreaded hangover.We’ve all been there, right  That last round of tequila shots sounded like a mighty fine idea, but now it’s the morning after the night before and you are paying for it – with interest.Your head is pounding, your stomach is queasy, and it feels like something small and furry crawled into your mouth overnight and died there.Granted, the damage has well and truly been done – but what can you do about it now  How do you cure that hangover  Heck, can you even cure a hangover Well, that depends on who you ask. There’s a host of weird and wonderful hangover cure claims floating around, but the old saying ‘horses for courses’ applies here. That is to say, what works for one person may not do a thing for another.At the risk of stating the obvious, the best way to avoid a hangover is to drink less alcohol. Or none at all.It’s also a very good idea to eat a decent meal before heading out, and alternating between an alcoholic beverage and a hydrating glass of water can lessen the effects of a hangover.Assuming, though, that all that sage advice went out of the window last night, here’s six hangover cures to try.A hearty bowl of soupOkay, so this is only a good ideayou can still stand straight, but Austrians swear by this method.When you’ve had a skinful of booze, grab a big bowl of goulash soup before heading to bed.It will prevent the alcohol soaking further into your bloodstream, and is always a better idea than that kebab you were craving at am.Eat a protein breakfastDr Andrew Irvine, who published How To Cure A Hangover, suggests a simple breakfast.“Protein, in the form of eggs, will help your hypoglycaemia , as will porridge,” he says. “The headache should ease once the blood sugar level has been corrected, then take some soluble paracetamol.”BeroccaThe Aussies, it’s fair to say, seem know a thing or two about drinking.After one too many tinnies, simply drop a tablet of this over-the-counter, nutrient-packed tablet in a glass of water.Works bestyou do the same before drinking. It may not completely cure your hangover, but it’s a refreshing pick-me-up that’s packed with vitamins.ParacetamolDissolve a soluble paracetamol tablet in a glass of water and not only will it go a long way towards curing that throbbing headache, but it will provide rehydration, which is all important. Unlike Ibuprofen it won’t irritate the stomach.Be warned, though: too much paracetamol is toxic to the liver – and it has probably taken enough of a pounding as it is. and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share by email\" data-param-subject\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Facebook\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Twitter\" data-param-text\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are foods you shouldnt feed your dog christmas ","story":"Tributes to larger than le NI footballer Jerry Thompson who died suddenlyTwo arrested after father of two Cecil Foggy Ellis found dead in PortadownNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleThe ethanol in alcohol can hit an animals bloodstream faster than humans.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
